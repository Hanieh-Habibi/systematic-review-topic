Previously, models with and without top-down connections, including lexical-semantic, pre-lexical (e.g., orthographic/ phonological), and visual processing levels were successful in accounting for these facilitation effects. Here we systematically assessed context-based facilitation with a repetition priming task and explicitly dissociated pre-lexical and lexical processing levels using a pseudoword familiarization procedure. Experiment 1 investigated the temporal dynamics of neuronal facilitation effects with magnetoencephalography (MEG; N=38 human participants) while Experiment 2 assessed behavioral facilitation effects (N=24 human participants). Across all stimulus conditions, MEG demonstrated context-based facilitation across multiple time windows starting at 100 ms, in occipital brain areas. This finding indicates context based-facilitation at an early visual processing level. In both experiments, we furthermore found an interaction of context and lexical familiarity, such that stimuli with associated meaning showed the strongest context-dependent facilitation in brain activation and behavior. Using MEG, this facilitation effect could be localized to the left anterior temporal lobe at around 400 ms, indicating within-level (i.e., exclusively lexical-semantic) facilitation but no top-down effects on earlier processing stages. Increased pre-lexical familiarity (in pseudowords familiarized utilizing training) did not enhance or reduce context effects significantly. We conclude that context based-facilitation is achieved within visual and lexical processing levels. Finally, by testing alternative hypotheses derived from mechanistic accounts of repetition suppression, we suggest that the facilitatory context effects found here are implemented using a predictive coding mechanism.","Cetaceans are a group of marine mammals whose ancestors were adaptated for life on land. Life in an aquatic environment poses many challenges for air-breathing mammals. Diving marine mammals have adapted to rapid reoxygenation and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated reperfusion injury. Here, we considered the evolution of the glutathione transferase (GST) gene family which has important roles in the detoxification of endogenously-derived ROS and environmental pollutants. We characterized the cytosolic GST gene family in 21 mammalian species; cetaceans, sirenians, pinnipeds, and their terrestrial relatives. All seven GST classes were identified, showing that GSTs are ubiquitous in mammals. Some GST genes are the product of lineage-specific duplications and losses, in line with a birth-and-death evolutionary model. We detected sites with signatures of positive selection that possibly influence GST structure and function, suggesting that adaptive evolution of GST genes is important for defending mammals from various types of noxious environmental compounds. We also found evidence for loss of alpha and mu GST subclass genes in cetacean lineages. Notably, cetaceans have retained a homolog of at least one of the genes GSTA1, GSTA4, and GSTM1; GSTs that are present in both the cytosol and mitochondria. The observed variation in number and selection pressure on GST genes suggest that the gene family structure is dynamic within cetaceans. Taken together, our results indicate that the cytosolic GST family in cetaceans reflects unique evolutionary dynamics related to oxygen-poor aquatic environments.","Abstract Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease still represents the leading cause of death in Western countries. A wealth of scientific evidence demonstrates that increased blood cholesterol levels have a major impact on the outbreak and progression of atherosclerotic plaques. Moreover, several cholesterol-lowering pharmacological agents, including statins and ezetimibe, have proved effective in improving clinical outcomes. This document focuses on the clinical management of hypercholesterolaemia and has been conceived by 16 Italian medical associations with the support of the Italian National Institute of Health. The authors discuss in detail the role of hypercholesterolaemia in the genesis of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. In addition, the implications for high cholesterol levels in the definition of the individual cardiovascular risk profile have been carefully analysed, while all available therapeutic options for blood cholesterol reduction and cardiovascular risk mitigation have been explored. Finally, this document outlines the diagnostic and therapeutic pathways for the clinical management of patients with hypercholesterolaemia. ","Appropriate nutraceutical combinations may represent a valid approach to prevent vascular calcification associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In the present study, we tested the effect of a new nutraceutical combination named RenaTris(r), containing MK-7, magnesium carbonate, and Sucrosomial(r) Iron, on vascular calcification in uremic rats. Rats were randomly divided into three groups, i.e., control (high-phosphate diet), uremic (high-phosphate diet containing 0.5% adenine), and supplemented uremic diet (0.5% adenine, MK-7, magnesium carbonate, and Sucrosomial(r) Iron). After six weeks, sera and vascular calcification were examined. The uremic diet increased creatinine and phosphate levels and induced extensive vascular calcification. The uremic condition also induced a mild hypercholesterolemic condition (+52% of total cholesterol; p &lt; 0.05). The supplemented uremic diet did not reduce creatinine, phosphate levels, or vascular calcification, however, we observed a significant hypocholesterolemic effect (-18.9% in supplemental uremic vs. uremic diet; p &lt; 0.05). Similar to simvastatin, incubation of cultured human hepatoma cells (Huh7) with MK-7 significantly reduced cholesterol biosynthesis (-38%) and induced 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) at both mRNA and protein levels. The effect of MK-7 on LDLR was counteracted by the co-incubation with squalene. Unlike simvastatin, MK-7 reduced PCSK9 in Huh7. These results indicated that the new nutraceutical combination significantly impacts cholesterol metabolism and its supplementation may help to control mild hypercholesterolemic conditions in CKD patients. ","Currently, there are a lack of FDA-approved tocolytics for the management of preterm labor. We previously observed that the isoflavones mundulone and mundulone acetate (MA) inhibit intracellular Ca2+-regulated myometrial contractility. Here, we further probed the potential of these natural products to be small molecule leads for discovery of novel tocolytics by: (1) examining uterine-selectivity by comparing concentration-response between human primary myometrial cells and a major off-target site, aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), (2) identifying synergistic combinations with current clinical tocolytics to increase efficacy or and reduce off-target side effects, (3) determining cytotoxic effects and (4) investigating the efficacy, potency and tissue-selectivity between myometrial contractility and constriction of fetal ductus arteriosus (DA), a major off-target of current tocolytics. Mundulone displayed significantly greater efficacy (Emax = 80.5% vs. 44.5%, p=0.0005) and potency (IC50 = 27 \u03bcM and 14 \u03bcM, p=0.007) compared to MA in the inhibition of intracellular-Ca2+ from myometrial cells. MA showed greater uterine-selectivity, compared to mundulone, based on greater differences in the IC50 (4.3 vs. 2.3 fold) and Emax (70% vs. 0%) between myometrial cells compared to aorta VSMCs. Moreover, MA demonstrated a favorable in vitro therapeutic index of 8.8, compared to TI = 0.8 of mundulone, due to its significantly (p&lt;0.0005) smaller effect on the viability of myometrial (hTERT-HM), liver (HepG2) and kidney (RPTEC) cells. However, mundulone exhibited synergism with two current tocolytics (atosiban and nifedipine), while MA only displayed synergistic efficacy with only nifedipine. Of these synergistic combinations, only mundulone + atosiban demonstrated a favorable TI = 10 compared to TI=0.8 for mundulone alone. While only mundulone showed concentration-dependent inhibition of ex vivo mouse myometrial contractions, neither mundulone or MA affected mouse fetal DA vasoreactivity. The combination of mundulone and atosiban yielded greater tocolytic efficacy and potency on term pregnant mouse and human myometrial tissue compared to single-drugs. Collectively, these data highlight the difference in uterine-selectivity of Ca2+-mobilization, effects on cell viability and tocolytic efficacy between mundulone and MA. These natural products could benefit from medicinal chemistry efforts to study the structural activity relationship for further development into a promising single- and/or combination-tocolytic therapy for management of preterm labor.","Le comite d'andrologie de l'Association Francaise d'Urologie a realise une enquete afin d'evaluer la prise en charge de la maladie de La Peyronie en milieu urologique en 1996. Une enquete prospective a ete realisee entre avril 1995 et septembre 1996 a l'aide d'un questionnaire, incluant tous les nouveaux patients vus en consultation pour ce motif. 201 patients ont ete inclus, de moyenne d'age de 55,3 ans (ecart type: 12,96). Un diabete sucre etait present chez 15,75% des patients et une maladie de Dupuytren chez 12,5%. La localisation des plaques, leur nombre et leur taille ont ete decrits de meme que la localisation de la coudure et les symptomes associes a la maladie. Le premier symptome de decouverte de la maladie etait la coudure isolee (35%), suivi de l'impuissance isolee et de la coudure associee a la douleur (17,5% chacun). Des investigations complementaires ont ete realisees chez 37% des patients (principalement echographie des corps caverneux, pharmacotest, radio simple, imagerie par resonance magnetique). Les traitements les plus frequemment prescrits en premiere intention ont ete la vitamine E (58%); les injections locales de corticoides (18%); 15,5% des patients n'ont pas eu de traitement (abstention surveillance). Le suivi moyen a ete de 6,8 mois (ecart type: 5,09). Globalement: 24% des patients ont ete perdus de vue, 12,5% ne sont pas evaluables (n'ayant eu qu'une seule visite), 30,5% des patients sont ameliores, 23% stabilises et 10% sont aggraves. Les differentes sous populations evolutives ont egalement ete analysees en fonction de leur symptomes et leur traitement.","Purpose: Angiosarcomas (AS) are soft tissue sarcomas with endothelial differentiation and vasoformative capacity. Most AS show strong constitutive expression of the endothelial adhesion receptor CD31/PECAM-1 pointing to an important role of this molecule. However, the biological function of CD31 in AS is unknown. Experimental design: The expression levels of CD31 in AS cells and its effects on cell viability, colony formation and chemoresistance was evaluated in human AS clinical samples and in cell lines through isolation of CD31high and CD31low cell subsets. The redox-regulatory CD31 function linked to YAP signaling was determined using a CD31 blocking antibody and siRNA approach and was further validated in CD31-knockout endothelial cells. Results: We found that most AS contain a small CD31low cell population. CD31low cells had lost part of their endothelial properties, were more tumorigenic and chemoresistant than CD31high cells due to more efficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification. Active downregulation of CD31 resulted in loss of endothelial tube formation, nuclear accumulation of YAP, and YAP-dependent induction of antioxidative enzymes. Addition of pazopanib, a known enhancer of proteasomal YAP degradation re-sensitized CD31low cells for doxorubicin resulting in growth suppression and induction of apoptosis. Conclusions: Human AS contain a small aggressive CD31low population that have lost part of their endothelial differentiation programs and are more resistant against oxidative stress and DNA damage due to intensified YAP signaling. Our finding that the addition of YAP inhibitors can re-sensitize CD31low cells towards doxorubicin may aid in the rational development of novel combination therapies to treat AS. ","Although techniques for non-invasive brain stimulation are under intense investigation, an approach that has received limited attention is transcranial photobiomodulation (tPBM), the delivery of near-infrared light to the brain with a laser directed at the scalp. Here we employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure the Blood-Oxygenation-Level Dependent (BOLD) signal in n = 20 healthy humans while concurrently stimulating their right frontal pole with a near-infrared laser. We failed to detect an evoked BOLD response at illumination. However, functional connectivity with the illuminated region increased by an average of 10% during stimulation, with some connections strengthening by as much as 40%. 23% of connections with the illuminated region experienced a significant acute increase, with the time course of connectivity exhibiting a sharp rise at illumination onset. Brain-wide connectivity increases were also observed, with connections in the stimulated hemisphere showing a significantly larger increase than those in the non-stimulated hemisphere. We subsequently employed MR Thermometry to measure brain temperature during tPBM (separate cohort, n = 20), and found no significant temperature differences between active and sham stimulation. Our findings suggest that near-infrared light synchronizes brain activity with a non-thermal mechanism, underscoring the promise of tPBM as a new technique for stimulating brain function.","The aim of the present study was to investigate correlation between plasma vitamin A, vitamin E, serum coenzyme Q10 levels and degree of insulin resistance in obese and normal weight people. The study was performed on 98 (21 Male, 77 Female) obese people and 78 (20 Male, 58 Female) control subjects. Vitamin A, E and coenzyme Q10 levels were adjusted to the lipid levels. Adjusted vitamin A and E and coenzyme Q10 levels of the obese female group were significantly lower than those of the control female group. Adjusted vitamin A and coenzyme Q10 levels of the obese male group were significantly lower than those of the control male group. Insulin resistance level of the obese female and male groups were significantly higher than that of the control female and male groups. There were no significant correlations between serum coenzyme Q10, plasma vitamin A and E levels and insulin resistance in obese and control subjects. Our findings show that it is essential to use the lipid adjusted levels of lipid soluble nutrients in obesity. Also, we have found no association between insulin resistance and vitamin A, vitamin E and coenzyme Q10 levels in obese subjects. ","Background Polyethylene (PE) liners are a common bearing surface of orthopaedic prostheses. In some products, vitamin E is added to PE as a preventive measure against oxidative degradation. Ultra-high molecular weight PE (UHMWPE) wear particles contribute to periprosthetic osteolysis, a major cause of aseptic loosening. Osteocytes are an important cell type for controlling both bone mineralisation and bone resorption, and respond to UHMWPE particles by inducing both osteocytic osteolysis and support of osteoclastogenesis. Here, we examined the effects of the vitamin E analogues \u03b1-tocopherol and \u03b3-tocotrienol alone or in the context of wear particles on human osteocyte gene expression and mineralisation behaviour.","The relation between health and nutrition has been popular at last year. So consumers select functional foods which are healthier than the others. Especially meat and meat products has negative perception on people due to they cause to increase in risk of canser and high colesterol. At this rewiev, studies about doing healthy and functional meat and meat products were investigated. For developing nutrition quality and functionality of raw meat vitamine E, vitamine C and selenyum are added to animal nutrition. With addition of several functional ingredients to product during process, meat products can be better in terms of sensory, textural and functionality.","The unique properties of ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) have made composites based on this polymer the gold standard choice for articulating surfaces used in arthroplasty. However, wear debris released by prosthesis is still a major concern of the implants. In this study, we address the urgent need to revisit the current methodologies used in designing these biomaterials by fabricating UHMWPE-based nanocomposite with Hydroxyapatite (HA), Multi-walled Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNTs), and Zirconia as additives. We investigated how different combinations of these additives impact the nanocomposites\u2019 hardness, plasticity index (PI), and friction coefficient. Our results show a constant increase in hardness by increasing Zirconia. The MTT assay test and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) demonstrated an increase in cell attachment and cell viability. Examining various additives\u2019 amounts, we can further explore the possibility of reaching an optimum proportion of the ingredients. Compared with other UHMWPE-based nanocomposites (UHMWPE-HA-MWCNT\u2019s), the fabricated nanocomposite shows an improvement in tribological properties.","Yellow nail syndrome is a rare disease with unknown etiology, Attributed to functional anomalies or disturbance in lymphatic drainage. This condition is characterized by triad of nail discoloration, respiratory or intrathoracic manifestations and lymphedema. Twenty days after mitral valve replacement for severe rheumatic mitral valve stenosis, 39 years old woman presented with face tenderness and hearing problems besides stuffy and clogged nose and underwent routin rhinosinusitis therapy. She came back to ears, nose and throat service with persistent rhinosinusitis as well as relapsing preoperative couphs and dyspnea besides lower extremities edema and toenails discoloration. After some modulations of treatment, she was introduced to pulmonary clinic on post -operative day = 30. Chest x ray showed a lot of left pleural effusion then she was returned to our service (cardiac surgery) on post- operative day = 33. The pigtail catheter was secured and we attained a significant amount of milky fluid which conformed with chylothorax. Finally Yellow nail syndrome was diagnosed with her on post-operative day = 35. Early conservative therapy such as bed rest, legs massage, low fat diet with medium chain triglycerides, diuretics, bronchodilator inhaler was not be able to satisfy us (chylous out put &gt; 330 cc/d). Therefore the catheter replacement with chest tube was carried out followed by pleurodesis using Talc and doxycycline besides transition of oral intake to total parentral nutrition and vitamine E supplement, on post - operative day = 41. After that chylous leakage gradually subsided and patient was discharged to home on post- operative day = 47. At 4 weeks follow ups, chest x ray was clear without effusion and nails discoloration and legs lymphedema resolved. We reported the third post cardiac surgery Yellow nail syndrome which is an unclear entity with a set of associated signs and symptoms. Two prior reports involved with coronary artery bypass graft whereas we performed mitral valve replacement. In angiogram thoracic duct was not identified so that it seems post cardiac surgery Yellow nail the syndrome has iatrogenic origin due to the thoracic duct or its tributaries injury and requires meticulous assessment and management.","The gut\u2013brain axis has received considerable attention in recent years, and the \u201cpsychobiotics\u201d concept indicates that probiotics have a potential positive effect on cognitive function. Therefore, the aim of this study was to quantitatively evaluate the influence of probiotics on cognitive function. We conducted a random-e?ects meta-analysis of 7 controlled clinical trials and 11 animals studies to evaluate the e?ects of probiotics on cognitive function. Probiotics supplementation enhanced cognitive function in both human (0.24 [0.05\u20130.42]; I2 = 0%) and animal studies (0.90 [0.47\u20131.34]; I2 = 74%). Subgroup analyses indicated that the effects of probiotics on cognitively impaired individuals (0.25 [0.05\u20130.45]; I2 = 0%) were greater than those on healthy ones (0.15 [\u22120.30 to 0.60]; I2 = 0%). Furthermore, compared with a multiple-probiotic supplement, one strain of probiotic was more effective in humans. The meta-analysis provided some suggestions for probiotics intervention and tended to support a customized approach for different individuals to ameliorate cognitive disorders. Future additional clinical trials are necessary to evaluate therapeutic effect and influencing factors.","Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder whose prevalence is rapidly increasing worldwide. The disease mechanisms of sporadic PD are not yet completely understood. Therefore, causative therapies are still lacking. To obtain a more integrative view of disease-mediated alterations, we investigated the molecular landscape of PD in human post-mortem midbrains. Tissue from 13 PD patients and 10 controls was subjected to small RNA sequencing, transcriptomics, and proteomics analysis. Differential expression analyses were performed reveal multiple deregulated molecular targets linked to known pathomechanisms of PD as well as novel processes. We found significant differential expression of miR-539-3p, miR-376a-5p, miR-218-5p, and miR-369-3p, the valid miRNA-mRNA interacting pairs of miR-218-5p/RAB6C, and miR-369-3p/GTF2H3, as well as multiple proteins relevant in the pathology of PD, including CHI3L1, SELENBP1, PRDX1, HSPA1B, and TH. Vertical integration of multiple omics analyses allowed to validate disease-mediated molecular alterations across different molecular layers and functional annotation of differentially expressed targets identified a strong enrichment of pathways related to inflammation and activation of the immune response. This suggests that neuroinflammation may significantly contribute to disease progression in PD and may be a promising therapeutic target in advanced stages of PD.","Background: Busulfan is a chemotherapy medicine for treatment of cancer. This medicine has cytotoxic effects on different organs of animal. Since the use of chemotherapy medicine are increasing due to individuals get involved to cancer, thus preserving of  reproductive system in these patients is essential to continue fertility. Materials and Method: In present study the testis of mice  were  injected with different doses of busulfan (35, 40 mg/kg body weight intraperitonealy. The effects of busulfan was examinned on destruction of testis tissue, semen parameters and catalase enzymatic activity compared with control group after 30 days. Finally, fter determining the effective dose of busulfan, Vitamin E was injected to the mice as an antioxidant enzyme  and its effects on semen parameters and testis tissue was examined after one month.  Results: The results showed that oxidative stress was increased in busulfan-treated mice during 30 days. Catalase enzymatic activity decreased significantly in testis of Busulfan-treated mice in comparison with control group. A significant decrease of sperm number was observed according to treatment by Busulfan. After finding the most damaging dose of busulfan (40 mg/kg ) in destruction of testis tissue, these mice were injected by vitamine E. The results showed that the oxidative stress and percentage of abnormal sperm were decreased in Busulfan-treated mice that exposed a dose of 100 mg/kg vitamin E. The number of sperm and antioxidant activity of catalase was increased. Conclusion: Vitamin E improves a revival of spermatogenesis and improves testicular parameters in these patients.","Heterogeneity in Alzheimer\u2019s disease progression contributes to the ongoing failure to demonstrate efficacy of putative disease-modifying therapeutics that have been trialled over the past two decades. Any treatment effect present in a subgroup of trial participants (responders) can be diluted by non-responders who ideally should have been screened out of the trial. How to identify (screen-in) the most likely potential responders is an important question that is still without an answer. Here we pilot a computational screening tool that leverages recent advances in data-driven disease progression modelling to improve stratification. This aims to increase the sensitivity to treatment effect by screening out non-responders, which will ultimately reduce the size, duration, and cost of a clinical trial. We demonstrate the concept of such a computational screening tool by retrospectively analysing a completed double-blind clinical trial of donepezil in people with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00000173), identifying a data-driven subgroup having more severe cognitive impairment who showed clearer treatment response than observed for the full cohort.","Objectives Dietary supplements may provide nutrients of relevance to ameliorate SARS-CoV-2 infection, although scientific evidence to support a role is lacking. We investigate whether the regular use of dietary supplements can reduce the risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection in around 1.4M users of the COVID Symptom Study App who completed a supplement use questionnaire.","Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is a heritable trait with two potential sources of heritability (h2): inherited variation in non-telomeric regions (e.g., SNPs that influence telomere maintenance) and variability in the lengths of telomeres in gametes that produce offspring zygotes (i.e., \u201cdirect\u201d inheritance). Prior studies of LTL h2 have not attempted to disentangle these two sources. Here, we use a novel approach for detecting the direct inheritance of telomeres by studying the association between identity-by-descent (IBD) sharing at chromosome ends and phenotypic similarity in LTL. We measured genome-wide SNPs and LTL for a sample of 5,069 Bangladeshi adults with substantial relatedness. For each of the 7,254 relative pairs identified, we used SNPs near the telomeres to estimate the number of chromosome ends shared IBD, a proxy for the number of telomeres shared IBD (Tshared). We then estimated the association between Tshared and the squared pairwise difference in LTL ((\u0394LTL)2) within various classes of relatives (siblings, avuncular, cousins, and distant), adjusting for overall genetic relatedness (\u03d5). The association between Tshared and (\u0394LTL)2 was inverse among all relative pair types. In a meta-analysis including all relative pairs (\u03d5 &gt;0.05), the association between Tshared and (\u0394LTL)2 (P=0.002) was stronger than the association between \u03d5 and (\u0394LTL)2 (P=0.45). Our results provide strong evidence that telomere length (TL) in parental germ cells impacts TL in offspring cells and contributes to LTL h2 despite telomere \u201creprogramming\u201d during embryonic development. Applying our method to larger studies will enable robust estimation of LTL h2 attributable to direction transmission.","Schwann cell (SC)-specific monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) knockout mice were generated by mating MCT1f/f mice with myelin protein zero (P0)-Cre mice. P0-Cre+/-, MCT1f/f mice have no detectable early developmental defects, but develop hypomyelination and reduced conduction velocity in sensory, but not motor, peripheral nerves during maturation and aging. Furthermore, enlarged node length and reduced mechanical sensitivity were evident in aged P0-Cre+/-, MCT1f/f mice. MCT1 deletion in SCs impairs both their glycolytic and mitochondrial functions, leading to altered lipid metabolism of triacylglycerides, diacylglycerides, and sphingomyelin, decreased expression of myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), and increased expression of c-Jun and p75-neurotrophin receptor, suggesting a regression of SCs to a less mature developmental state. Taken together, our results define the essential role of SC MCT1 in both SC metabolism and peripheral nerve maturation and aging.","","","Objective Patients who undergo microvascular decompression (MVD) often experience post-craniotomy headache (PCH), while the PCH is always neglected. This study is aimed to describe the natural course and risk factors of PCH.","Naturalistic stimuli, such as movies, are being increasingly used to map brain function because of their high ecological validity. The pioneering studyforrest and other naturalistic neuroimaging projects have provided free access to multiple movie-watching functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets to prompt the community for naturalistic experimental paradigms. However, sluggish blood-oxygenation-level-dependent fMRI signals are incapable of resolving neuronal activity with the temporal resolution at which it unfolds. Instead, magnetoencephalography (MEG) measures changes in the magnetic field produced by neuronal activity and is able to capture rich dynamics of the brain at the millisecond level while watching naturalistic movies. Herein, we present the first public prolonged MEG dataset collected from 11 participants while watching the 2 h long audio-visual movie \u201cForrest Gump\u201d. Minimally preprocessed data was also provided to facilitate the use of the dataset. As a studyforrest extension, we envision that this dataset, together with fMRI data from the studyforrest project, will serve as a foundation for exploring the neural dynamics of various cognitive functions in real-world contexts.","Neural mechanisms are complex and difficult to image. This paper presents a new space-time resolved whole-brain imaging framework, called Neurophysiological Mechanism Imaging (NMI), that identifies neurophysiological mechanisms within cerebral cortex at the macroscopic scale. By fitting neural mass models to electromagnetic source imaging data using a novel nonlinear inference method, population averaged membrane potentials and synaptic connection strengths are efficiently and accurately imaged across the whole brain at a resolution afforded by source imaging. The efficiency of the framework enables return of the augmented source imaging results overnight using high performance computing. This suggests it can be used as a practical and novel imaging tool. To demonstrate the framework, it has been applied to resting-state magnetoencephalographic source estimates. The results suggest that endogenous inputs to cingulate, occipital, and inferior frontal cortex are essential modulators of resting-state alpha power. Moreover, endogenous input and inhibitory and excitatory neural populations play varied roles in mediating alpha power in different resting-state sub-networks. The framework can be applied to arbitrary neural mass models and has broad applicability to image neural mechanisms in different brain states.","One of the very first observations made regarding alpha oscillations (8\u201314 Hz), is that they increase in power over posterior areas when awake participants close their eyes. Recent work, especially in the context of (spatial) attention, suggests that alpha activity reflects a mechanism of functional inhibition. However, it remains unclear how eye closure impacts anticipatory alpha modulation observed in attention paradigms, and how this affects subsequent behavioral performance. Here, we recorded magnetoencephalography (MEG) in 33 human participants performing a tactile discrimination task with their eyes open vs. closed. We replicated the hallmarks of previous somatosensory spatial attention studies: alpha lateralization across the somatosensory cortices as well as alpha increase over posterior regions. Furthermore, we found that eye closure leads to (i) reduced task performance, (ii) widespread increase in alpha power, and (iii) reduced anticipatory visual alpha modulation (iv) with no effect on somatosensory alpha lateralization. Regardless of whether participants had their eyes open or closed, increased posterior alpha power and somatosensory alpha lateralization improved their performance. Thus, we provide evidence that eye closure does not alter the impact of anticipatory alpha modulations on behavioral performance. We propose there is an optimal posterior alpha level for somatosensory task performance, which can be achieved through a combination of eye closure and top-down anticipatory attention.","An active component has been isolated by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) from Achyranthes bidentata Blume polypeptides that are extracted from Achyranthes bidentata Blume, a Chinese medicinal herb. The active component is called ABPPk based on the order of HPLC elution. In this study, we used in vitro and in vivo experimental models of cerebral ischemia to investigate the possible neuroprotective effect of ABPPk. ABPPk treatment promoted neuronal survival and inhibited neuronal apoptosis in primary cortical neurons exposed to oxygen and glucose deprivation and in rats subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. The role of ABPPk in protection against ischemia-induced neuronal damage might be mediated by mitochondrial-dependent pathways, including modulation of apoptosis-related gene expression, regulation of mitochondrial dysfunction through restoring mitochondrial membrane potential, reducing release of mitochondrial apoptogenic factors, and inhibiting intracellular ROS production. The neuroprotective effect of ABPPk may suggest the possible use of this agent in the treatment and prevention of cerebral ischemic stroke. ","Understanding the neural underpinnings of major depressive disorder (MDD) and its treatment could improve treatment outcomes. While numerous studies have been conducted, findings are variable and large sample replications scarce. We aimed to replicate and extend altered functional connectivity findings in the default mode, salience and cognitive control networks (DMN, SN, and CCN respectively) associated with MDD and pharmacotherapy outcomes in a large, multi-site sample. Resting-state fMRI data were collected from 129 patients and 99 controls through the Canadian Biomarker Integration Network in Depression (CAN-BIND) initiative. Symptoms were assessed with the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Connectivity was measured as correlations between four seeds (anterior and posterior DMN, SN and CCN) and all other brain voxels across participants. Partial least squares, a multivariate statistical technique, was used to compare connectivity prior to treatment between patients and controls, and between patients reaching remission early (MADRS \u2264 10 within 8 weeks), late (MADRS \u2264 10 within 16 weeks) or not at all. We replicated previous findings of altered connectivity in the DMN, SN and CCN in patients. In addition, baseline connectivity of the anterior/posterior DMN and SN seeds differentiated patients with different treatment outcomes. Weaker connectivity within the anterior DMN and between the anterior DMN and the SN and CCN characterised early remission; stronger connectivity within the SN and weaker connectivity between the SN and the DMN and CCN was related to late remission, of which the weaker SN \u2013 anterior DMN connectivity might specifically be associated with remission to dual pharmacotherapy; and connectivity strength between the posterior DMN and cingulate areas distinguished all three groups, with early remitters showing the strongest connections and non-remitters the weakest. The stability of these baseline patient differences was established in the largest single-site subsample of the data. Our replication and extension of altered connectivity within and between the DMN, SN and CCN highlighted previously reported and new differences between patients with MDD and controls, and revealed features that might predict remission prior to pharmacotherapy.","Objective Ataxia with vitamin E deficiency (AVED) is a rare autosomal recessive neurological disorder which usually starts in childhood. The clinical presentation is very similar to Friedreich ataxia, most patients have progressive truncal and extremity ataxia, areflexia, positive Babinski sign, dysarthria and sensory neuropathy. Methods We made an inquiry to our colleagues in Norway, we included information from a prevalence study published southern Norway and added data from our own known case. Results A newly published prevalence study of hereditary ataxias (total of 171 subjects) found only one subject with AVED in Southeast Norway. We describe two more patients, one from the Central part and one from the Northern part of Norway. All 3 cases had age of onset in early childhood (age of 4-5 years) and all experienced gait ataxia and dysarthria. The genetic testing confirmed that they had pathogenic mutations in the a-tocopherol transfer protein gene (TTPA). All were carriers of the non-sense c.400C &gt; T mutation, one was homozygous for that mutation and the others were compound heterozygous, either with c.358G &gt; A or c.513_514insTT. The homozygous carrier was by far the most severely affected case. Conclusions We estimate the occurrence of AVED in Norway to be at least 0.6 per million inhabitants. We emphasize that all patients who develop ataxia in childhood should be routinely tested for AVED to make an early diagnosis for initiating treatment with high dose vitamin E to avoid severe neurological deficits. ","The hippocampus supports episodic memory via interaction with a distributed brain network. Previous experiments using network-targeted noninvasive brain stimulation have identified episodic memory enhancements and modulation of activity within the hippocampal network. However, mechanistic insights were limited because these effects were measured long after stimulation and therefore could have reflected various neuroplastic aftereffects with extended timecourses. In this experiment with human subjects of both sexes, we tested for immediate stimulation impact on encoding-related activity of the hippocampus and immediately adjacent medial-temporal cortex by delivering theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (TBS) concurrent with fMRI, as an immediate impact of stimulation would suggest an influence on neural activity. We reasoned that TBS would be particularly effective for influencing the hippocampus because rhythmic neural activity in the theta band is associated with hippocampal memory processing. First, we demonstrated that it is possible to obtain robust fMRI correlates of task-related activity during concurrent TBS. We then identified immediate effects of TBS on encoding of visual scenes. Brief volleys of TBS targeting the hippocampal network increased activity of the targeted (left) hippocampus during scene encoding and increased subsequent recollection. Stimulation did not influence activity during an intermixed numerical task with no memory demand. Control conditions using beta-band and out-of-network stimulation also did not influence hippocampal activity or recollection. TBS targeting the hippocampal network therefore immediately impacted hippocampal memory processing. This suggests direct, beneficial influence of stimulation on hippocampal neural activity related to memory and supports the role of theta-band activity in human episodic memory.","Background Insulin Resistance (IR) affects a quarter of the world\u2019s adult population and is a major factor in the pathogenesis of cardio-metabolic disease. Non-invasive sampling of exhaled breath contains metabolic markers indicative of underlying systemic metabolic abnormality.","The use of natural antioxidants, in particular polyphenols such as dihydroquercetin (DHQ), in animal nutrition have recently increased in popularity. This may partly be due to the risk of increased incidences of heat stress associated with raising livestock in warmer ambient temperatures, facilitated by global warming, reducing antioxidant capacity. The current research demonstrates the effect of dietary DHQ, vitamin E and standard or high ambient temperatures on growth performance, energy and nutrient metabolism, gastrointestinal tract development (GIT), jejunal villus morphometry and antioxidant status in broiler chickens. Each of the four experimental diets were fed to 16 pens of five birds, which were allocated to four rooms (four pens in each room). The temperature in two rooms was maintained at a constant 35 \u00b0C (high temperature; HT), and the temperature in the other two rooms was gradually reduced from 27 \u00b0C at 7d of age to 22 \u00b0C at 20d of age (standard temperature; ST). Rearing birds at HT reduced: feed intake, weight gain, weight of small intestine, total GIT, liver, spleen, heart, villus height, villus surface area and lowered blood glutationperoxidase (GSH-Px). Dietary DHQ increased blood GSH-Px and total antioxidant status, increased heart weight and reduced caecal size. When fed separately, DHQ and vitamin E improved hepatic vitamin E concentration. Feeding vitamin E increased spleen and liver weights. When fed together, DHQ and vitamin E reduced villus height, villus height to crypt depth ratio and villus surface area. Temperature and antioxidants did not affect energy and nutrient metabolism. There were no effects of dietary antioxidants on growth performance of broiler chickens and there were no mortalities. At present it is unclear if feeding antioxidants (in particular DHQ) at different levels, using different dietary formulations, and rearing birds under a range of environmental conditions may be effective at enhancing production performance and bird health in hot ambient climates.","Constructing and comparing gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data has the potential to reveal critical components in the underlying regulatory networks regulating different cellular transcriptional activities. Here, we present a robust and powerful machine learning workflow\u2014scTenifoldNet\u2014for comparative GRN analysis of single cells. The scTenifoldNet workflow, consisting of principal component regression, low-rank tensor approximation, and manifold alignment, constructs and compares transcriptome-wide single-cell GRNs (scGRNs) from different samples to identify gene expression signatures shifting with cellular activity changes such as those associated with pathophysiological processes and responses to environmental perturbations. We used simulated data to benchmark scTenifoldNet\u2019s performance, and then applied scTenifoldNet to several real data sets. In real-data applications, scTenifoldNet identified highly specific changes in gene regulation in response to acute morphine treatment, an antibody anticancer drug, gene knockout, double-stranded RNA stimulus, and amyloid-beta plaques in various types of mouse and human cells. We anticipate that scTenifoldNet can help achieve breakthroughs through constructing and comparing scGRNs in poorly characterized biological systems, by deciphering the full cellular and molecular complexity of the data.","Selenium (Se) is a trace element with important roles in human health. Several selenoproteins have essential functions in development. However, the cellular and tissue distribution of Se remains largely unknown because of the lack of analytical techniques that image this element with sufficient sensitivity and resolution. Herein, we report that X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM) can be used to visualize and quantify the tissue, cellular and subcellular topography of Se. We applied this technique to characterize the role of Se in spermatogenesis and identified a dramatic Se enrichment specifically in late spermatids, a pattern that was not seen in any other elemental maps. This enrichment was due to elevated levels of the mitochondrial form of glutathione peroxidase 4 and was fully dependent on the supplies of Se by Selenoprotein P. High-resolution scans revealed that Se concentrated near the lumen side of elongating spermatids, where structural components of sperm are formed. During spermatogenesis, maximal Se associated with decreased phosphorus, whereas Zn did not change. In sperm, Se was primarily in the midpiece and co-localized with Cu and Fe. XFM allowed quantification of Se in the midpiece (0.8 fg) and head (0.14 fg) of individual sperm cells, revealing the ability of sperm cells to handle the amounts of this element well above its toxic levels. Overall, the use of XFM allowed visualization of tissue and cellular Se and provided important insights in the role of this and other trace elements in spermatogenesis. ","Objective Improper management of polypharmacy in community and hospital pharmacies may lead to adverse effects and drug interactions in patients of all age groups, especially children and the elderly. This study aimed to determine the scenario of polypharmacy in multiple communities in Nepal and the costs associated with them.","Background: Blackcurrant anthocyanin (BCA) is expected to repair endothelial dysfunction, but it remains unclear whether beneficial effects are present in young healthy persons. This study examines whether supplements containing blackcurrant anthocyanin improve endothelial function and peripheral temperature in young smokers. Methods: Young, healthy male nonsmokers (N group: n = 11; mean age 22 +- 2 years) and smokers (S group: n = 13; mean age 21 +- 1 years) were enrolled. A randomized and double-blind trial was designed to compare the effects of no supplement, a supplement containing 50 mg of blackcurrant anthocyanin (supplement A), and a supplement containing 50 mg of blackcurrant anthocyanin plus vitamin E (supplement B) on flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) and skin temperature. Results: Under no supplement, FMD was unchanged during the 2 h period after smoking in the N group, whereas it was decreased during the 2 h period after smoking in the S group. Under the A supplement, FMD was decreased 1 h after smoking and returned to the baseline level 2 h after smoking in the S group. The skin temperature in the area of the foot dorsum was decreased in the S group after smoking compared with that in the N group, who did not smoke, whereas under A and B supplements, it was higher in the S group compared with that in the N group. Conclusions: BCA could attenuate the smoking-induced acute endothelial dysfunction and improve peripheral temperature in young smokers. ","Heat stress is known as one of the most prevalent environmental stressors in poultry production, which is associated with oxidative stress. Stinging nettle is a medicinal herb with strong antioxidant properties. The present study was conducted to evaluate the effects of dietary stinging nettle at two different levels (2% and 4%) on growth performance and oxidative stress indices of broilers exposed to chronic heat stress. On day 14, a total of 240 broiler chickens were randomly assigned to 6 treatment groups as follows: 1) NC: negative control; 2) HS: heat-stressed broiler; 3) HS-SN2: heat-stressed broiler fed by 2% dietary stinging nettle; 4) HS-SN4: heat-stressed broilers fed by 4% stinging nettle; 5) SN2: no heat-stressed broilers fed by 2% dietary stinging nettle; 6) SN4: no heat-stressed broilers fed by 4% dietary stinging nettle. Diet supplementation with stinging nettle was performed from days 14 to 35 and a chronic heat stress was induced from days 22 to 29. The growth performance and oxidative indices were evaluated on days 14, 21, 29, and 35. Rectal temperature and panting frequency were assessed on days 22, 25, and 29. As a result, weight gain and food intake decreased in the HS compared to the NC, and these parameters increased in the HS-SN2 and HS-SN4 compared to the HS (P&lt;0.05). The HS, HS-SN2, and HS-SN4 groups had a significantly higher rectal temperature and panting frequency. The HS had the higher circulating MDA and HSP70, and lower T-AOC, SOD, and GSH-Px compared to the treatments. The HS-SN4 had a significantly lower MDA and HSP70, and higher T-AOC, GSH-Px, and SOD compared to the HS and HS-SN2. In conclusion, the addition of 4% stinging nettle powder to the broilers\u2019 diet improved the oxidative status in heat-stressed birds. Furthermore, this herb could be utilized as a feed additive in poultry diet to improve bird\u2019s health and defense mechanisms under stressful conditions.","Objective Practice effects on cognitive tests obscure decline, thereby delaying detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This reduces opportunities for slowing Alzheimer\u2019s disease progression and can hinder clinical trials. Using a novel method, we assessed the ability of practice-effect-adjusted diagnoses to detect MCI earlier, and tested the validity of these diagnoses based on AD biomarkers.","Quantifying the physiology of aging is essential for improving our understanding of age-related disease and the heterogeneity of healthy aging. Recent studies have shown that in regression models using \u201c-omic\u201d platforms to predict chronological age, residual variation in predicted age is correlated with health outcomes, and suggest that these \u201comic clocks\u201d provide measures of biological age. This paper presents predictive models for age using metabolomic profiles of cerebrospinal fluid from healthy human subjects, and finds that metabolite and lipid data are generally able to predict chronological age within 10 years. We use these models to predict the age of a cohort of subjects with Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s disease and find an increase in prediction error, potentially indicating that the relationship between the metabolome and chronological age differs with these diseases. In our analysis of control subjects, we find the carnitine shuttle, sucrose, biopterin, vitamin E metabolism, tryptophan, and tyrosine to be the most associated with age. We showcase the potential usefulness of age prediction models in a small dataset (n = 85), and discuss techniques for drift correction, missing data imputation, and regularized regression which can be used to help mitigate the statistical challenges that commonly arise in this setting. To our knowledge, this work presents the first multivariate predictive metabolomic and lipidomic models for age using mass spectrometry analysis of cerebrospinal fluid.","","","Aging has been linked to several degenerative processes that, through the accumulation of molecular and cellular damage, can progressively lead to cell dysfunction and organ failure. Human aging is linked with a higher risk for individuals to develop cancer, neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, and metabolic disorders. The understanding of the molecular basis of aging and associated diseases has been one major challenge of scientific research over the last decades. Mitochondria, the center of oxidative metabolism and principal site of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, are crucial both in health and in pathogenesis of many diseases. Redox signaling is important for the modulation of cell functions and several studies indicate a dual role for ROS in cell physiology. In fact, high concentrations of ROS are pathogenic and can cause severe damage to cell and organelle membranes, DNA, and proteins. On the other hand, moderate amounts of ROS are essential for the maintenance of several biological processes, including gene expression. In this review, we provide an update regarding the key roles of ROS--mitochondria cross talk in different fundamental physiological or pathological situations accompanying aging and highlighting that mitochondrial ROS may be a decisive target in clinical practice. ","Brevibacillus texasporus peptide (BT peptide) is immunomodulatory in poultry as a feed additive to substitute antibiotics. In the present study we performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing to compare development of the cecal microbial communities in Clostridium perfringens-challenged broilers fed basal diet only or with either BT peptide (48 ppm) or antibiotics mixture (20 ppm bacitracin zinc and 40 ppm colistin sulfate). 240 chicks were randomly assigned into each treatment and a total of 65 cecal samples were collected at the beginning, during seven challenge days and one week post challenge. The composition of microbial communities was clearly distinguishable over time. Treatments with challenge and the antibiotics mixture were associated with increased diversity and with higher relative abundances of Alistipes sp. CHKCI003 and Faecalibacterium and lower abundance of Escherichia coli (all p &lt; 0.05). At the termination of the trial, the cecal microbiota in broilers supplemented with BT peptide was dominated by members of Bacteroidaceae. Predicted function analysis reveals significant enrichment of genes involved in ion-coupled transporters and sugar and biotin metabolism in the BT peptide treatment. Taken together, our results suggest that BT peptide and commonly used antibiotics have different influences on modulating the composition of cecal microbiota in broilers.","Objective Overconsumption of processed foods has led to an increase in chronic diet-related diseases such obesity and type 2 diabetes. Although diets high in fresh fruits and vegetables are linked with healthier outcomes, the specific mechanisms for these relationships are poorly understood. Experiments examining plant phytochemical production and breeding programs, or separately on the health effects of nutritional supplements have yielded results that are sparse, siloed, and difficult to integrate between the domains of human health and agriculture. To connect plant products to health outcomes through their molecular mechanism an integrated computational resource is necessary.","In the presented study for the first time a new, optimized, fast SFC (supercritical fluid chromatography) method was applied to separate in one run fat-soluble vitamins from waste fish oil, including cis-and trans-retinyl palmitate, cis- and trans-retinyl acetate, retinol, a-tocopherol, b-tocopherol, g-tocopherol, d-tocopherol, ergocalciferol (D2), cholecalciferol (D3), cis- and trans-phylloquinone (K1) and menaquinone-4 (K2-MK4). Vitamins were baseline separated on an Acquity UPC2 (ultra performance convergence chromatography) HSS C18 SB (highly strength chemically modified silica) column within 13 min. The influence of the stationary phase, such as Torus 1-AA (1-aminoanthracene), Torus Diol (high density diol), Torus DEA (diethylamine), BEH (silica with no bonding), BEH-2EP (2-ethylpirydine), CSH Fluoro-Phenyl (silica with fluoro-phenyl groups), column temperature, flow rate and back pressure on the separation of the compounds was described. The application of the modified saponification procedure allowed us to increase concentration in the sample prepared for the analysis of g-tocopherol from less than 1% (wt %) to 14% for the first time. In addition, a-tocopherol, g-tocopherol, d-tocopherol and retinol were identified in waste fish oil. Vitamin purification and analysis in waste fish oil are reported for the first time here. Due to the short time and effectiveness of the proposed method, it can be easily applied in industrial processes. ","Fetal life is characterized by a tremendous plasticity and ability to respond to various environmental and lifestyle factors, including maternal nutrition. Identification of the role of dietary factors that can modulate and reshape the cellular epigenome during development, including methyl group donors (e.g., folate, choline) and bioactive compounds (e.g., polyphenols) is of great importance; however, there is insufficient knowledge of a particular effect of each type of modulator and/or their combination on fetal life. To enhance the quality and safety of food products for proper fetal health and disease prevention in later life, a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of dietary epigenetic modulators during the critical prenatal period is necessary. This review focuses on the influence of maternal dietary components on DNA methylation, histone modification, and microRNAs, and summarizes current knowledge of the effect and importance of dietary components on epigenetic mechanisms that control the proper expression of genetic information. Evidence reveals that some components in the maternal diet can directly or indirectly affect epigenetic mechanisms. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of how early-life nutritional environment affects the epigenome during development is of great importance for the successful prevention of adult chronic diseases through optimal maternal nutrition. ","Background Salicylic acid (SA) is a metabolite that can be obtained from the diet via fruit and vegetable ingestion, of which increased consumption has observationally been shown to decrease risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). Whilst primary prevention trials of SA and CRC risk are lacking, there is strong evidence from clinical trials and prospective cohort studies that aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) is an effective primary and secondary chemopreventative agent. Since aspirin is rapidly deacetylated to form SA, it follows that SA may have a central role for aspirin chemoprevention. Through a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach, we aimed to address whether levels of SA affected CRC risk, and whether aspirin intake as a proxy for increased SA levels was required to identify an effect.","There are no pharmacological disease-modifying treatments that can mitigate the seizures and comorbidities associated with established chronic temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). This study evaluated the effect of sodium selenate in the post-status epilepticus (SE) rat model of chronic drug resistant TLE. Wistar rats underwent kainic acid-induced SE or sham. Ten-weeks post-SE, rats were randomly assigned to receive either sodium selenate, levetiracetam, or vehicle treatments continuously for 4 weeks. To evaluate the effects of the treatments, 1 week of continuous video-EEG was acquired before, during, and 4, 8 weeks post-treatment, followed by behavioral tests. Targeted and untargeted proteomics and metabolomics were performed on post-mortem brain tissue to identify potential pathways associated with modified disease outcomes. Telomere length was investigated as a novel surrogate marker of disease severity. Sodium selenate treatment was able to mitigate disease severity, reducing the number of spontaneous seizures (p&lt; 0.05), cognitive dysfunction (p&lt; 0.05 in both novel object placement and recognition tasks), and sensorimotor deficits (p&lt; 0.01) 8 weeks post-treatment cessation. Moreover, increased protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) expression, reduced hyperphosphorylated tau, and reversed telomere length shortening caused 1 by SE (p&lt; 0.05). Network medicine integration of multi-omics/ pre-clinical outcomes identified protein-metabolite modules positively correlated with the TLE phenotype. Our results provide evidence that treatment with sodium selenate results in a sustained disease modifying effect in chronically epileptic rats in the post-KA SE model of TLE, including improved comorbid learning and memory deficits.","","Carotenoids and tocopherols are health-promoting metabolites in livestock and human diets. Some important crops have been genetically modified to increase their content. Although the usefulness of transgenic plants to alleviate nutritional deficiencies is obvious, their social acceptance has been controversial. Here, we demonstrate an alternative biotechnological strategy for carotenoid and tocopherol fortification of edible fruits in which no transgenic DNA is involved. A viral RNA vector derived from Zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV) was modified to express a bacterial phytoene synthase (crtB), and inoculated in zucchini (Cucurbita pepo L.) leaves nurturing pollinated flowers. After the viral vector moved to the developing fruit and expressed crtB, the rind and flesh of the fruits developed yellow-orange rather than green color. Metabolite analyses showed a substantial enrichment in health-promoting carotenoids, such as \u03b1- and \u03b2-carotene (pro-vitamin A), lutein and phytoene, in both rind and flesh. Considerably higher accumulation of \u03b1- and \u03b3-tocopherol was also detected, particularly in fruit rind. Although this strategy is perhaps not free from controversy due to the use of genetically modified viral RNA, our work does demonstrate the possibility of metabolically fortifying edible fruits using an approach in which no transgenes are involved.","Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic disease that affects nowadays millions of people worldwide. In adults, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) accounts for the majority of all diagnosed cases of diabetes. The course of the T2DM is characterized by insulin resistance and a progressive loss of b-cell mass. DM is associated with a number of related complications, among which cardiovascular complications and atherosclerosis are the main cause of morbidity and mortality in patients suffering from the disease. DM is acknowledged as a low-grade chronic inflammatory state characterized by the over-secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1b, which reinforce inflammatory signals thus contributing to the development of complications. In this context, the pharmacological approaches to treat diabetes should not only correct hyperglycaemia, but also attenuate inflammation and prevent the development of metabolic and cardiovascular complications. Over the last years, novel biological drugs have been developed to antagonize the pathophysiological actions of IL-1b. The drugs currently used in clinical practice are anakinra, a recombinant form of the naturally occurring IL-1 receptor antagonist, the soluble decoy receptor rilonacept and the monoclonal antibodies canakinumab and gevokizumab. This review will summarize the main experimental and clinical findings obtained with pharmacological IL-1b inhibitors in the context of the cardiovascular complications of DM, and discuss the perspectives of IL-1b inhibitors as novel therapeutic tools for treating these patients. ","","Parkinson's disease (PD) is caused by progressive neurodegeneration of dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons with abnormal accumulation of a-synuclein in substantia nigra (SN). Studies have suggested the potential involvement of dopamine, iron, calcium, mitochondria and neuroinflammation in contributing to overwhelmed oxidative stress and neurodegeneration in PD. Function studies on PD-causative mutations of SNCA, PRKN, PINK1, DJ-1, LRRK2, FBXO7 and ATP13A2 further indicate the role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of PD. Therefore, it is reasonable that molecules involved in oxidative stress, such as DJ-1, coenzyme Q10, uric acid, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosin, homocysteine, retinoic acid/carotenes, vitamin E, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, xanthine oxidase and products of lipid peroxidation, could be candidate biomarkers for PD. Applications of antioxidants to modulate oxidative stress could be a strategy in treating PD. Although a number of antioxidants, such as creatine, vitamin E, coenzyme Q10, pioglitazone, melatonin and desferrioxamine, have been tested in clinical trials, none of them have demonstrated conclusive evidence to ameliorate the neurodegeneration in PD patients. Difficulties in clinical studies may be caused by the long-standing progression of neurodegeneration, lack of biomarkers for premotor stage of PD and inadequate drug delivery across blood-brain barrier. Solutions for these challenges will be warranted for future studies with novel antioxidative treatment in PD patients. ","The interaction between inclement weather and disease acquisition is a long-recognized relationship. In the case of coccidiosis, a parasitic infestation of the intestines, wet weather is known to promote incidences in livestock. Our opportunistic investigation tracks blood chemistries of goats that were exposed to coccidian in a 100 year rain event in Oklahoma. Our results suggest a potentially patterned response of blood chemistries that may be developed into a clinical tool in the future and provide warnings for producers of the risks associated with growing incidences of excessively wet weather related to climate change.","In 2010, the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) started the Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-be (nuMoM2b), a prospective cohort study of a racially/ethnically/geographically diverse population of nulliparous women with singleton gestation. The nuMoM2b is a very large dataset, consisting of data for 10,038 patients with over 4,600 features per patient, spread out over 80 files. In this report, we share our experience preparing and working with this dataset. We present our data preprocessing of the nuMoM2b dataset to get a deeper understanding of the data, extract the most relevant features, make the fewest assumptions when filling in unknown values, and reducing the dimensionality of the data. We hope this report is useful to researchers interested in building machine learning and statistical models from the nuMoM2b dataset.","La steatohepatite non-alcoolique (NASH) est une maladie du foie responsable de complications et de mortalite de causes hepatique (fibrose, cirrhose, hepatocarcinome) et extra-hepatique (insulinoresistance, maladies cardiovasculaires). Actuellement, il n'existe pas de traitement approuve dans cette indication. Toutefois, une perte de poids de 5 a 10 % du poids initial permet d'ameliorer l'histologie hepatique. Cet objectif est cependant, soit difficile a atteindre chez tous les patients, soit peu efficace ou pas indique en cas de diagnostic de la maladie a un stade de cirrhose irreversible. Differents medicaments, a notre disposition dans le contexte dysmetabolique, sont presentes (statines, metformine...) avec leur impact sur la maladie hepatique.

Quatre autres composes sont actuellement egalement testes en phase 3. L'article fait egalement le point sur le benefice potentiel d'une combinaison de traitements. D'autres pistes therapeutiques, comme la chirurgie de l'obesite, la modulation du microbiote et l'endoscopie bariatrique, sont exposes. ","Dingoes have not been artificially selected in the past 3,500 years. They occupy a wide range of the Australian mainland and play a crucial role as an apex predator with a generalist omnivorous feeding behaviour. In contrast, humans have selected breed dogs for novel and desirable traits. First, we explore whether the distinct evolutionary histories of dingoes and domestic dogs can lead to plasma metabolomic differences. We study metabolite composition differences between dingoes (n=15) and two domestic dog breeds (Basenji n= 9 and German Shepherd Dog: GSD n=10). After accounting for within group variation, 62 significant metabolite differences were detected between dingoes and domestic dogs, with a greater number of differences in protein (n= 14) and lipid metabolites (n= 12). Most differences were observed between dingoes and domestic dogs and fewest between the domestic dog breeds. Second, we investigate variation between pure dingoes (n=10) and dingo-dog hybrids (n=10) as hybridisation is common. We detected no significant differences in metabolite levels between dingoes and dingo-dog hybrids after Bonferroni correction. However, power analyses reported that increasing the sample size to 15 could result in differences in uridine 5\u2019-diphosphogalactose (UDPgal) levels related to galactose metabolism. We suggest this may be related to an increase in Amylase 2B copy number in hybrids. Our study illustrates that the dingo metabolome is significantly different from domestic dog breeds and hybridisation is likely to influence carbohydrate metabolism.","Deksametason telah diketahui sebagai obat kortikosteroid sintetik yang banyak digunakan oleh masyarakat. Jika deksametason digunakan dalam jangka waktu panjang dan pemakaian dosis besar, menyebabkan stres oksidatif pada sel akibat akumulasi radikal bebas yang menyebabkan kematian sel pada jaringan organ tubuh. Vitamin E diketahui memiliki peran yang baik sebagai antioksidan. Saat ini belum diketahui efek samping pemberian deksametason dan vitamin E terhadap kerusakan usus halus tikus putih (Rattus norvegicus). Penelitian ini menggunakan sampel 25 ekor tikus putih jantan, dibagi dalam 5 kelompok perlakuan, yaitu kontrol negatif (P0), kontrol positif (P1) diberikan deksametason Harsen  0.13 mg/kg, dan perlakuan diberikan deksametason Harsen 0.13 mg/kg dengan variasi vitamin E (Natur-E) bertingkat yaitu P2 (100 mg/kg), P3 (150 mg/kg), dan P4 (200 mg/kg). Setelah perlakuan diberikan selama 2 minggu, tikus dinekropsi dan usus halus diambil untuk selanjutnya dibuat sediaan histopatologi dengan pewarnaan hematoksilin-eosin (HE). Hasil menunjukkan perlakuan P1 terlihat nekrosis berat (kaseosa) pada usus halus, sedangkan seluruh perlakuan P2, P3, dan P4 berpengaruh terhadap perbaikan kerusakan akibat efek samping deksametason. Perlakuan 4 (P4) sebagai hasil paling baik dalam mengurangi efek samping deksametason.   Dexamethasone it's in period a synthetic corticosteroid drug that widely used by the public.

After the treatment was given for 2 weeks, the mice at necropsied and the small intestine were taken for histopathological examination using hematoxyline-eosin staining. Results showed treatment P1 found severe necrosis (caseosa) in the small intestine, while the entire treatment P2, P3, and P4 affect the repair of damage due to effects of the dexamethasone. Treatment 4 (P4) was the best results in reducing the effects of dexamethasone.","Iron dysregulation has been implicated in multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson\u2019s Disease (PD), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), and Multiple Sclerosis (MS). One prominent feature of affected brain regions are iron-loaded microglia, but how iron overload influences microglia physiology and disease response is poorly understood. Here we show that microglia are highly susceptible to ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of cell death. In a tri-culture of human iPSC-derived neurons, astrocytes, and microglia, under ferroptosis-inducing conditions, microglia undergo a drastic shift in cell state, with increased ferritin levels, disrupted glutathione homeostasis, and altered cytokine signaling. Similar ferroptosis-associated signature (FAS) microglia were uncovered in PD, and the signature was also found in a large cohort of PD patient blood samples, raising the possibility that ferroptosis can be identified clinically. We performed a genome-wide CRISPR screen which revealed a novel regulator of ferroptosis, the vesicle trafficking gene SEC24B. A small molecule screen also nominated several candidates which blocked ferroptosis, some of which are already in clinical use. These data suggest that ferroptosis sits at the interface of cell death and inflammation, and inhibition of this process in microglia and other brain cells may provide new ways for treating neurodegenerative disease.","This study examines the development of a new green and eco-friendly formulation derived from Opuntia dillenii seed oil (labeled as FOD) and its application as a corrosion inhibitor to protect iron which is subject to corrosion phenomena that become important especially in acidic environments as acid rain. Physicochemical properties and fatty acid analysis of Opuntia dillenii seed oil were performed and they demonstrated that the oil is a major source of unsaturated fatty acids, in particular linoleic acid, with a percentage of 73.388%. Corrosion inhibition effect of FOD was studied by gravimetric methods, electrochemical measurements, and scanning electron microscopy coupled with elemental analysis (SEM/EDX). Obtained results confirmed that FOD behaves as a good mixed corrosion inhibitor with predominant anodic activity. Inhibition efficiency of FOD is more important when the concentration of FOD and the immersion time increase, reaching values up to 99%. FOD forms a barrier layer on the surface of the iron, and thereby minimizes the contact area between the metal surface and the corrosive solution. The adsorption behavior of FOD on iron surface obeys Langmuir adsorption isotherm with chemisorption and physisorption mechanism. Opuntia dillenii, Seed oil, Corrosion Inhibition, Iron, Acid rain. ","An experiment was conducted to examine the effects of supplementing broiler feed with hesperidin or naringin, on growth performance, carcass characteristics, breast meat quality and the oxidative stability of breast and thigh meat. Two hundred and forty 1-day-old Ross 308 broiler chickens were randomly assigned to 6 groups. One of the groups served as a control (C) and was given commercial basal diets, whereas the other five groups were given the same diets further supplemented with naringin at 0.75 g/kg (N1), naringin at 1.5 g/kg (N2), hesperidin at 0.75 g/kg (E1), hesperidin at 1.5 g/kg (E2) and a-tocopheryl acetate at 0.2 g/kg (E). At 42 days of age, 10 chickens per treatment group were slaughtered for meat quality and oxidative stability assessment. No significant differences were observed among groups in final body weight, carcass weight and internal organs weights (P&gt;0.05) apart from liver that decreased linearly with increased levels of naringin (P-linear&lt;0.05). Regarding the breast meat quality parameters, only redness (a*) value was higher in E1 and N1 group compared to VE group (P&lt;0.05), while all the others i.e. shear values (N/mm2), pH24, cooking loss (%) and L* and b* color parameters were not significantly different among groups (P&gt;0.05). Measurement of lipid oxidation values showed that after hesperidin and naringin dietary supplementation, malondialdehyde values decreased in tissue samples in a dose depended manner (P-linear&lt;0.05). In conclusion, hesperidin and naringin, positively influence meat antioxidative properties without negative implications on growth performance and meat quality characteristics in poultry, thus appearing as important additives for both the consumer and the industry. ","Two experiments were performed for evaluating calibration curve (CC) and comparing negative and positive controls (CNP) as a major method for estimating of phytase phosphorus equivalence for layer and broiler chickens. In the first and second experiments, 360 Hy-line W-36 layer hens and 525 day-old Ross-308 broiler chickens were used in a complete randomized design, respectively. Evaluated methods were setting the two regression equations for NPP-supplemented and phytase supplemented treatments with two sub-methods, include calibration curve (CC) or exclude the amount of phosphorus content of basal diet (CC-BD) in calculation, and exploring enzyme equivalency by comparing phosphorus deficient diet as an negative and supplemented diet by inorganic phosphorus sources as a positive control group (CNP). Experiment one included nine treatments (200, 300, 400 and 500 FTU/kg phytase was added to a phosphorus deficient basal diet contained 0.12% AvP, the rest four treatments were included basal diet supplemented with 0.20, 0.27, 0.35 and 0.43% AvP). Experiment two included seven treatments (a basal P deficient diet contained 0.27% AvP, and two increasing levels of AvP, 0.32 and 0.37%, and four doses of phytase 200, 300, 400 and 500 FTU/kg added to basal diet). Each treatment in the both experiments replicated five times. Results indicated that methods of estimation had a significant effect on phosphorus equivalence estimation (P&lt;0.0001). Fitted regression equations considering P content of basal diet (CC-BD) estimated rational values than those ignore it (CC) (0.161% vs 0.365% and 0.432% vs 0.564% for 500 FTU/kg phytase for broiler chicken and layer hens, respectively) (P&lt;0.0001). On average, among three methods used, CC method had the highest estimated values both in broiler chickens and layer hens (p&lt;0.0001). Regardless of mathematical method, there were different significant values for different strains (layer, 0.381% and broiler, 0.179%) (P&lt;0.0001), but not for different traits served as response criteria (P&gt;0.05). In conclusion, the phosphorus equivalent value of enzyme varies according to the estimation methods and strain. Hence, using matrix values of enzyme for accurate feed formulation depend on a variety of circumstances and decision making requires comprehensive information.","We report a method of metabolomic profiling of intact tissue based on molecular preservation by extraction and fixation (mPREF) and high-performance chemical isotope labeling (CIL) liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS). mPREF extracts metabolites by aqueous methanol from tissue biopsies without altering tissue architecture and thus conventional histology can be performed on the same tissue. In a proof-of-principle study, we applied dansylation LC-MS to profile the amine/phenol submetabolome of prostate needle biopsies from 25 patient samples derived from 16 subjects. 2900 metabolites were consistently detected in more than 50% of the samples. This unprecedented coverage allowed us to identify significant metabolites for differentiating tumor and normal tissues. The panel of significant metabolites was refined using 36 additional samples from 18 subjects. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis showed area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 0.896 with sensitivity of 84.6% and specificity of 83.3% using 7 metabolites. A blind study of 24 additional validation samples gave a specificity of 90.9% at the same sensitivity of 84.6%. The mPREF extraction can be readily implemented into the existing clinical workflow. Our method of combining mPREF with CIL LC-MS offers a powerful and convenient means of performing histopathology and discovering or detecting metabolite biomarkers in the same tissue biopsy. ","The possible protective effects of methanolic extract Acrocarpus fraxinifolius leaves (MEAFL) were assessed against the APAP\u2013induced organ toxicity in male rats. Also, the content of polyphenols extracted from AFL was studied, and their relationship with antioxidant activity was investigated. MEAFL was tested for cytotoxicity on Vero cell line, with reference to IC50, and other non-toxic concentrations of all the extracts. The antiviral activity against HSV1 for all non-toxic concentrations of the extract was determined using plaque reduction assay. It was found that MEAFL showed a reduction of serum hepatic and renal cellular toxicity and cellular lipid peroxidation, as well as enhanced cellular antioxidant. Also, our results revealed that the inhibitory activity of the virus was dose dependent on the polyphenol content of the examined extract. The MIC for the MEAFL extract was determined as well as the EC50 and SI. Calculated SI showed promising value for the MEAFL, and hence can be used as therapeutic medication for HSV1. To study other possible mode of action, Vero cells were treated with the examined extracts before, during, and after virus infection to give an insight on the interference of the extract in each step in the virus life cycle. In conclusion, MEAFL showed a remarkable antioxidant effect against APAP induced organs toxicity. Also, examined extracts exhibited the antiviral activity against HSV1.","Background Uptake of nutritional supplementation during pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has been limited by an absence of rigorous evidence-based studies supporting use. Our objective were to report and summarise the current evidence supporting use of nutritional supplementation to improve outcomes during pulmonary rehabilitation in stable COPD patients.","Mass Spectrometry imaging (MS imaging) provides spatial information for a wide range of compound classes in different sample matrices. We used MS imaging to investigate the distribution of components in fresh and processed food, including meat, dairy and bakery products. The MS imaging workflow was optimized to cater to the specific properties and challenges of the individual samples. We successfully detected highly nonpolar and polar constituents such as beta-carotene and anthocyanins, respectively. For the first time, the distribution of a contaminant and a food additive was visualized in processed food. We detected acrylamide in German gingerbread and investigated the penetration of the preservative natamycin into cheese. For this purpose, a new data analysis tool was developed to study the penetration of analytes from uneven surfaces. Our results show that MS imaging has great potential in food analysis to provide relevant information about components\u2019 distributions, particularly those underlying official regulations.","Recent focus is on analysis of biological activities of extracts from plant species. Zygophyllaceae is exceedingly important angiosperm family with many taxa being used in folk medicines widely dispersed in arid and semi-arid zones of Balochistan, Pakistan. Only a small proportion of them have been scientifically analyzed and many species are nearly facing extinction. Therefore present investigation explores the biochemical and bioactive potential of fourteen folk medicinal plants usually used for treatments of different ailments. Fresh aerial parts of nine taxa and two fruit samples were collected from plants growing in arid and semi-arid zones of Balochistan and analyzed for enzymatic, non-enzymatic and other biochemical activities. Higher phytochemical activities were detected in the aerial parts. Superoxide dismutase was detected maximum in Fagonia indica, (184.7\u00b15.17 units/g), ascorbate peroxidase in Tribulus longipetalus subsp. longipetalus (947.5\u00b112.5 Units/g), catalase and peroxidase was higher in Peganum harmala (555.0\u00b15.0 and 2597.8\u00b10.4 units/g respectively). Maximum esterase and alpha amylase activity was found in Zygophyllum fabago (14.3\u00b10.44 and 140\u00b118.8 mg/g respectively). Flavonoid content was high in T. longipetalus subsp. longipetalus (666.1\u00b149 \u03bcg/ml). The highest total phenolic content and tannin was revealed in F. olivieri (72125\u00b1425 and 37050\u00b11900 \u03bcM/g. respectively). Highest value of ascorbic acid was depicted in F. bruguieri var. rechingeri (448\u00b11.5 \u03bcg/g). Total soluble Proteins and reducing sugars were detected higher in P. harmala (372.3\u00b154 and 5.9\u00b10.1 mg/g respectively). Maximum total antioxidant capacity (TAC) was depicted in Z. simplex (16.9\u00b10.01 \u03bcM/g). Pigment analysis exhibited the high value of lycopene and total carotenoids in T. terrestris (7.44\u00b10.2 and 35.5\u00b10.0 mg/g respectively). Chlorophyll a, b and total chlorophyll content was found maximum in T. longipetalus subsp. pterophorus (549.1\u00b19.9, 154.3\u00b110 and 703.4\u00b120.2 ug/g respectively). All taxa exhibited anti-inflammatory activity as well as anti-diabetic inhibitory potential. Seed extracts of Zygophyllum eurypterum (96%) exhibited highest inhibitory potential, along with twelve other taxa of Zygophyllaceae indicated (96-76%) activity when compared with the standard drug diclofenac sodium (79%). Seeds of T. longipetalus subsp. longipetalus (85%) exhibited the highest anti-diabetic activity; other eleven taxa also exhibited inhibitory activity of \u03b1-amylase ranging from (85-69%) compared with Metformin (67%) standard drug. Phytochemical screening revealed that selected taxa proved to be the potential source of natural antioxidants and could further be explored for in-vivo studies and utilized in pharmaceutical industries as potent therapeutic agents validating their ethno-pharmacological uses.","Resume Introduction L'usage de cannabis, de cocaine ou d'heroine peut etre responsable de complications pulmonaires parmi lesquelles figure l'asthme. Objectifs L'objectif de cette revue systematique de la litterature est d'exposer les donnees concernant la relation entre la consommation de cannabis, de cocaine ou d'heroine et l'asthme. Resultats L'usage de cannabis, de cocaine ou d'heroine par voie inhalee peut etre responsable de symptomes respiratoires (toux, sifflements thoraciques), favoriser le developpement d'un asthme, augmenter le risque d'exacerbation aigue d'asthme (pouvant necessiter une intubation et une ventilation invasive), voire des deces par asthme et diminuer l'observance du traitement de l'asthme. Le cannabis a un effet bronchodilatateur rapide. En revanche, sa consommation chronique provoque une diminution de la conductance specifique des voies aeriennes. Les etudes portant sur la diminution ou le declin du volume expiratoire maximal par seconde (VEMS) sont discordantes. Conclusion Une consommation de cannabis, de cocaine ou d'heroine doit etre recherchee devant des symptomes respiratoires survenant chez des sujets jeunes et les praticiens doivent aider les usagers de ces substances illicites a arreter leur consommation. ","Background Eggs are nutrient dense and rich source of quality protein and their consumption could significantly reduce incidence of chronic and infectious diseases especially in the elderly. This study determined egg consumption and factors that influence consumption among the elderly in Tamale metropolis.","Inherited genetic variation impacts local gene expression and DNA methylation in humans. Expression and methylation quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs and cis-mQTLs) often occur at the same genomic location, suggesting a common causal variant and shared mechanism. Using DNA and RNA from peripheral blood of Bangladeshi individuals, we use \u201cco-localization\u201d methods to identify 3,695 eQTL-mQTL pairs that are likely to share a causal variant. Using partial correlation analysis and mediation analysis, we identify &gt;500 pairs with evidence of a causal relationships between expression and methylation (i.e., shared mechanism) with many additional pairs that we are underpowered to detect. These co-localized pairs are enriched for SNPs showing opposite effects on expression and methylation, although a many affect multiple CpGs in opposite directions. Evidence of shared SNP-age interaction also supports shared mechanisms for two eQTL-mQTL pairs. This work demonstrates the pervasiveness of co-regulated expression and methylation traits in the human genome. This approach can be applied to other types of molecular QTLs to enhance our understanding of regulatory mechanisms.","Extensive interactions occur between a poultry host and its gut microbiome. Glycerol monolaurate (GML) possesses a large range of antimicrobial and immunoregulatory properties. This study was conducted to investigate the impact of different doses of GML (basal diets complemented with 0, 300, 600, 900, or 1200 mg/kg GML) on growth performance, intestinal barrier, and cecal microbiota in broiler chicks. Results revealed that feed intake increased after 900 and 1200 mg/kg GML were administered during the entire 14-day experiment period. Dietary GML decreased crypt depth and increased the villus height-to-crypt depth ratio of the jejunum. In the serum and jejunum, supplementation with more than 600 mg/kg GML reduced interleukin-1\u03b2, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, and malondialdehyde levels and increased the levels of immunoglobulin G, jejunal mucin 2, total antioxidant capacity, and total superoxide dismutase. GML down-regulated jejunal interleukin-1\u03b2 and interferon-\u03b3 expression and increased the mRNA level of zonula occludens 1 and occludin. A reduced expression of toll-like receptor 4 and a tendency of down-regulated nuclear factor kappa-B was shown in GML-treated groups. In addition, GML modulated the composition of the cecal microbiota of the broilers, improved microbial diversity, and increased the abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria. Spearman\u2019s correlation analysis revealed that the genera Barnesiella, Coprobacter, Lachnospiraceae, Faecalibacterium, Bacteroides, Odoriacter, and Parabacteroides were related to inflammation and intestinal integrity. In conclusion, GML ameliorated intestinal morphology and barrier function in broiler chicks probably by regulating intestinal immune and antioxidant balance, as well as intestinal microbiota.","Cucurbita moschata D. seed oil contains approximately 75% unsaturated fatty acids, with high levels of monounsaturated fatty acids and antioxidant compounds such as vitamin E and carotenoid, constituting a promising food in nutritional terms. Associated to this, the Brazilian germplasm of C. moschata exhibits remarkable variability, representing an important source for the genetic breeding of this vegetable and other cucurbits. In this context, the present study evaluated the productivity and profile of the seed oil of 91 C. moschata accessions from different regions of Brazil and maintained in the Vegetable Germplasm Bank of the Federal University of Vi\u00e7osa (BGH-UFV). A field experiment was conducted between January and July 2016. The tested C. moschata accessions showed high genetic variability in terms of characteristics related to seed oil productivity (SOP), such as the mass of seeds per fruit and productivity of seeds, providing predicted selection gains of 29.39 g and 0.26 t ha-1, respectively. Based on the phenotypic and genotypic correlations, greater SOP can be achieved while maintaining high oleic acid content and low linoleic acid content, providing oil of better nutritional and chemical quality. In variability analysis, the accessions were clustered into five groups, which presented different averages for SOP and fatty acid content of seed oil; approach that will guide the use of appropriate germplasm in programs aimed at genetic breeding for SOP and seed oil profile. Per se analysis identified BGH-4610, BGH-5485A, BGH-6590, BGH-5556A, BGH-5472A, and BGH-5544A as the most promising accessions in terms of SOP, with average (\u03bc+g) of approximately 0.20 t ha-1. The most promising accessions for higher oleic acid content of seed oil were BGH-5456A, BGH-3333A, BGH-5361A, BGH-5472A, BGH-5544A, BGH-5453A, and BGH-1749, with average (\u03bc+g) of approximately 30%, and almost all of these accessions were also the most promising in terms of lower linoleic acid content of seed oil, with average (\u03bc+g) of approximately 45%. Overall, part of the C. moschata accessions evaluated in the present study can serve as a promising resource in genetic breeding programs for SOP and fatty acid profile, aiming at the production of oil with better nutritional and physicochemical quality.","Fungi and plants are rich sources of thousands of secondary metabolites. The genetically coded possibilities for secondary metabolite production, the stimuli of the production, and the special phytotoxins basically determine the microscopic fungi-host plant interactions and the pathogenic lifestyle of fungi. The review introduces plant secondary metabolites usually with antifungal effect as well as the importance of signaling molecules in induced systemic resistance and systemic acquired resistance processes. The review also concerns the mimicking of plant effector molecules like auxins, gibberellins and abscisic acid by fungal secondary metabolites that modulate plant growth or even can subvert the plant defense responses such as programmed cell death to gain nutrients for fungal growth and colonization. It also looks through the special secondary metabolite production and host selective toxins of some significant fungal pathogens and the plant response in form of phytoalexin production. New results coming from genome and transcriptional analyses in context of selected fungal pathogens and their hosts are also discussed. ","The treatment of L929 fibrosarcoma cells with zVAD has been shown to induce necroptosis. However, whether autophagy is involved or not in this event remains controversial. In this study, we re-examined the role of autophagy in zVAD-induced cell death in L929 cells and further elucidated the signaling pathways triggered by caspase inhibition and contributing to autophagic death. First, we found that zVAD can stimulate LC3-II formation, autophagosome and autolysosome formation and ROS accumulation. Antioxidants, beclin 1 or Atg5 silencing and class III PtdIns3K inhibitors all effectively blocked ROS production and cell death, suggesting ROS accumulation downstream of autophagy contributes to cell necrosis. zVAD also stimulated PARP activation, and the PARP inhibitor DPQ can reduce zVAD-induced cell death, but did not affect ROS production, suggesting the increased ROS leads to PARP activation and cell death. Notably, our data also indicated the involvement of Src-dependent JNK and ERK in zVAD-induced ROS production and autophagic death. We found caspase 8 is associated with c-Src at the resting state, and upon zVAD treatment this association was decreased and accompanied by c-Src activation. In conclusion, we confirmed the autophagic death in zVAD-treated L929 cells, and defined a new molecular pathway in which Src-dependent ERK and JNK activation can link a signal from caspase inhibition to autophagy, which in turn induce ROS production and PARP activation, eventually leading to necroptosis. Thus, in addition to initiating proteolytic activity for cell apoptosis, inactivated caspase 8 also functions as a signaling molecule for autophagic death. ","Background Many nutrients have powerful immunomodulatory actions with the potential to alter susceptibility to COVID-19 infection, progression to symptoms, likelihood of severe disease and survival. The pandemic has fostered many nutrition-related theories, sometimes backed by a biased interpretation of evidence.","To evaluate the effects of a\u00e7ai extract (EA) on oxidative stress and inflammation induced by high glucose in cultured mouse immortalized mesangial cells (MiMC) and diabetic rats. MiMC cell viability and proliferation were determined by MTT. Extracellular and intracellular nitric oxide (NO) and intracellular ROS were also measured. The cell proteins were extracted for analysis of catalase, Nrf2, p-Nrf2, SOD-1, SOD-2, iNOS, NF-\u03baB, p-NF-\u03baB and TNF-\u03b1 expression. Male, adult Wistar rats were distributed into 3 groups: control (CTL) and diabetic (DM) rats who received water and DMEA and received 1 mL/day EA (200 mg/kg) via gavage for 8 consecutive weeks. After treatment with EA, metabolic profile, renal function and thiobarbituric acid reactives substances (TBARS) levels were evaluated, and kidneys were collected for qualitative histological analysis. EA maintained cell viability above 90% in all groups; it decreased proliferation in the HG group, both significant. NO levels, ROS generation, iNOS, NF-\u03baB, p-NF-\u03baB and TNF-\u03b1 expression were reduced significantly after 72 h of EA treatment, with significant increases for all antioxidants studied. DMEA vs DM showed a significant increase in body weight, improved kidney function and reduced TBARS excretion. EA treatment decreased proliferation, oxidative stress and inflammation in MiMC, and although a\u00e7ai did not decrease fasting glucose, it recovered the body weight and delayed the decline of renal function in the diabetic animals, suppressing the signaling of inflammatory mediators via NF-\u03baB inactivation and increasing all antioxidants studied by upregulating the Nrf2 response pathway.","ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE To describe food and macronutrient intake profile and estimate the prevalence of inadequate micronutrient intake of Brazilian adolescents. METHODS Data from 71,791 adolescents aged from 12 to 17 years were evaluated in the 2013-2014 Brazilian Study of Cardiovascular Risks in Adolescents (ERICA). Food intake was estimated using 24-hour dietary recall (24-HDR). A second 24-HDR was collected in a subsample of the adolescents to estimate within-person variability and calculate the usual individual intake. The prevalence of food/food group intake reported by the adolescents was also estimated. For sodium, the prevalence of inadequate intake was estimated based on the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL). The Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) method used as cutoff was applied to estimate the prevalence of inadequate nutrient intake. All the analyses were stratified according to sex, age group and Brazilian macro-regions. All statistical analyses accounted for the sample weight and the complex sampling design. RESULTS Rice, beans and other legume, juice and fruit drinks, breads and meat were the most consumed foods among the adolescents. The average energy intake ranged from 2,036 kcal (girls aged from 12 to 13 years) to 2,582 kcal (boy aged from14 to 17 years). Saturated fat and free sugar intake were above the maximum limit recommended (&lt; 10.0%). Vitamins A and E, and calcium were the micronutrients with the highest prevalence of inadequate intake (&gt; 50.0%). Sodium intake was above the UL for more than 80.0% of the adolescents. CONCLUSIONS The diets of Brazilian adolescents were characterized by the intake of traditional Brazilian food, such as rice and beans, as well as by high intake of sugar through sweetened beverages and processed foods. This food pattern was associated with an excessive intake of sodium, saturated fatty acids and free sugar. RESUMO OBJETIVO Descrever o perfil de consumo alimentar e de macronutrientes, e estimar a prevalencia de inadequacao da ingestao de micronutrientes em adolescentes brasileiros. METODOS Foram avaliados dados de 71.791 adolescentes de 12 a 17 anos que participaram do Estudo de Riscos Cardiovasculares em Adolescentes (ERICA), realizado em 2013-2014. O consumo alimentar foi estimado por meio de recordatorio alimentar de 24h; em uma subamostra dos adolescentes foi coletado um segundo R24h para a estimativa da variancia intrapessoal e o calculo de ingestao alimentar usual. Estimou-se prevalencia de consumo de alimentos ou grupos de alimentos referidos pelos adolescentes. Para ingestao inadequada de sodio considerou-se valores acima do nivel de ingestao maxima toleravel. Prevalencias de inadequacao foram calculadas pelo metodo da Necessidade Media Estimada (Estimated Average Requirement - EAR) como ponto de corte. Todas as analises foram estratificadas segundo sexo, faixa etaria e macrorregioes do Pais, e levaram em consideracao o peso amostral e a complexidade do desenho do estudo. RESULTADOS Os alimentos mais consumidos pelos adolescentes foram arroz, feijao e outras leguminosas, sucos e refrescos, paes, e carne bovina. A ingestao media de energia dos adolescentes variou de 2.036 kcal (meninas de 12 a 13 anos) a 2.582 kcal (meninos de 14 a 17 anos). O consumo de acidos graxos saturados e de acucar livre ultrapassaram limites maximos recomendados da ingestao energetica total (&lt; 10,0%). Maiores prevalencias de inadequacao (&gt; 50,0%) foram para calcio e vitaminas A e E. O consumo de sodio foi acima dos limites maximos recomendados em mais de 80,0% dos adolescentes. CONCLUSOES A dieta dos adolescentes brasileiros e caracterizada pelo consumo de alimentos tradicionais, como arroz e feijao, e ingestao elevada de bebidas acucaradas e alimentos ultraprocessados. Esse padrao associa-se a elevada inadequacao da ingestao de calcio, vitaminas A e E e ao consumo excessivo de acidos graxos saturados, sodio e acucar livre. ","Apolipoprotein B (ApoB) is the primary protein of chylomicrons, VLDLs and LDLs and is essential for their assembly. Defects in ApoB synthesis and secretion result in several human diseases, including abetalipoproteinemia and familial hypobetalipoproteinemia. Conversely, high levels of APOB in plasma are associated with increased risk for coronary heart disease and atherosclerosis.","Solar lentigo, benign lesions which mostly appear on chronically, sun-exposed surfaces, are associated with ageing. Patients are increasingly requesting a more uniform skin texture, especially for hands. Treatment options include dermoabrasion, intense pulsed light, cryotherapy, peelings, and laser therapy. Topical compounds can be employed, in alternative or associated with dermatologic procedures. The current study was designed to evaluate solar lentigo hyperpigmentation, skin architecture and clinician and patient assessments comparing a dermocosmetic lightening product (active) with a moisturizing product (control) according to clinical, digital and subjective analyses in 72 lesions over 12-month follow up period. Statistically significant differences were observed between the lesions treated with the active compared to the control in terms of papillary brightness (p = 0.03) and contrast (p = 0.03), and in the limitation of dermal-epidermal junction destructuring (p = 0.03) according to dermal-epidermal junction destructuring score at Reflectance Confocal Microscopy. Luminance (p = 0.04) and redness (p = 0.03) were improved at color analysis, and physician and patient evaluations favored the active in efficacy and patient satisfaction investigations. The dermocosmetic lightening product utilized in the current study proved to be more effective, according to clinical, digital and subjective analyses in reducing lesion hyperpigmentation, stabilizing the lesion skin architecture and increasing patient satisfaction compared to the control in a cohort of 36 subjects, over a 12-month period. Beside demonstrating the efficacy of this topical lightening product, we propose a \"destructuring score\", which improves the robustness of solar lentigo's evaluation, and can be used in future studies to standardize the quantitative comparisons of different treatment options. ","Vitamin E constitutes a family of eight molecules well-known for its antioxidant properties and its essentiality in fertility. Its ability to regulate gene expression is more and more described and could be a major actor of its biological activity. Adipose tissue which is the main store site of vitamin E within the body is also subjected to the regulatory effect of vitamin E. These regulations could strongly impact adipose tissue physiology.","Kenaf seed oil was extracted with 3 different solvents, i.e. hexane, ethanol and aqueous enzymatic medium with or without ultrasonic assistance. The synergistic effects of ultrasound and extraction solvent on the content of bioactive compound in kenaf seed oil was investigated. Results show that ultrasound-assisted extraction with hexane obtained the highest yield (84.71%), while yield with aqueous enzymatic medium was the lowest (51.12%). Two endothermic peaks exhibited on the melting curve of kenaf seed oil at the temperature range - 37 to - 25 degC and - 12 to - 2 degC, respectively. Linoleic, oleic and palmitic acid are the major fatty acids, accounting for above 96% of the total fatty acids. The content of vitamin E, phosphatide, total phenols and sterol are 92.38-105.01 mg/100 g oil, 0.38-22.28 g/kg, 0.51-71.02 mg GAE/100 g and 161.79-533.12 mg/100 g, respectively. The solvent employed has significant effect (p &lt; 0.05) on the thermal property, fatty acid composition and bioactive constituents of the extracted kenaf seed oil. The oil extracted with ethanol contained more nervonic acid and bioactive components such as b-carotene, phosphatide, total phenols and sterols. The introduction of ultrasound reduced the extraction time remarkably. The results demonstrate that extraction with ethanol combined with ultrasound is an effective method to extract kenaf seed oil, as more reasonable fatty acid composition and higher content of bioactive components can be achieved. ","Cell death can be executed by regulated apoptotic and non-apoptotic pathways, including the iron-dependent process of ferroptosis. Small molecules are essential tools for studying the regulation of cell death. Using live-cell, time-lapse imaging, and a library of 1,833 small molecules including FDA-approved drugs and investigational agents, we assemble a large compendium of kinetic cell death \u2018modulatory profiles\u2019 for inducers of apoptosis and ferroptosis. From this dataset we identified dozens of small molecule inhibitors of ferroptosis, including numerous investigational and FDA-approved drugs with unexpected off-target antioxidant or iron chelating activities. ATP-competitive mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, by contrast, were on-target ferroptosis inhibitors. Further investigation revealed both mTOR-dependent and mTOR-independent mechanisms linking amino acid levels to the regulation of ferroptosis sensitivity in cancer cells. These results highlight widespread bioactive compound pleiotropy and link amino acid sensing to the regulation of ferroptosis.","Introduction Immunosenescence leads to increased morbidity and mortality associated with viral infections and weaker vaccine responses. This has been well documented for seasonal influenza and the current pandemic with Sars-Cov2, which disproportionately impact older adults, particularly those in residential aged care facilities. Inadequate nutrient intake associated with impaired immunity, respiratory and muscle function are likely to augment the effects of immunosenescence. In this study, we test whether the effects of inadequate nutrition can be reversed by multi-nutrient supplementation, consequently enhancing vaccine responses, reducing the risk of viral infections, and improving respiratory and muscle function.","Objective We aimed to evaluate BMI changes in HIV adults\u2019 subjects in the first year of ART in malaria endemic areas.","Background Observational studies have demonstrated inverse associations between vegetable intake and cardiovascular diseases. However, the results are prone to residual confounding. The separate effects of cooked and raw vegetable intake remain unclear. This study aims to investigate the association between cooked and raw vegetable intake with cardiovascular outcomes using Mendelian randomization (MR).","Background Debate about whether high intake of dietary saturated fatty acids (SFA) causes coronary heart disease (the lipid hypothesis) is ongoing.","Introduction Dietary nitrate lowers blood pressure and improves athletic performance in humans, yet data supporting observations that it may increase cerebral blood flow and improve cognitive performance are mixed. Here we tested the hypothesis that nitrate and nitrite treatment would improve indicators of learning and cognitive performance in a zebrafish (Danio rerio) model. We also explored the extent to which nitrate and nitrite treatment affected the brain metabolome in order to understand how nitrate and nitrite supplementation may affect indices of cognitive function.","Nigratine (also known as 6E11), a natural flavanone derivative, was characterized as highly specific non-ATP competitive inhibitor of RIPK1 kinase, one of the key component of necroptotic cell death signaling. We show here that nigratine inhibited both necroptosis (induced by Tumor Necrosis Factor-\u03b1) and ferroptosis (induced by glutamate, erastin or RSL3 small chemical compounds) with EC50 in the \u00b5M range. Altogether, the data obtained showed that nigratine is the first-in-class dual inhibitor of necroptosis and ferroptosis cell death routes and opened new therapeutic avenues for treating complex necrosis-related diseases.","Winter squash fruits (Cucurbita moschata D.) are among the best sources of vitamin A precursors and constitute sources of bioactive components such as phenolic compounds and flavonoids. Approximately 70% of C. moschata seed oil is made up of unsaturated fatty acids, with high levels of monounsaturated fatty acids and components such as vitamin E and carotenoids, which represent a promising nutritional aspect in the production of this vegetable. C. moschata germplasm expresses high genetic variability, especially in Brazil. We assessed 91 C. moschata accessions, from different regions of Brazil, and maintained at the UFV Vegetable Germplasm Bank, to identify early-flowering accessions with high levels of carotenoids in the fruit pulp and high yields of seed and seed oil. Results showed that the accessions have high variability in the number and mass of seeds per fruit, number of accumulated degree-days for flowering, total carotenoid content, and fruit productivity, which allowed selection for considerable gains in these characteristics. Analysis of the correlation between these characteristics provided information that will assist in selection to improve this crop. Cluster analysis resulted in the formation of 16 groups, confirming the variability of the accessions. Per se analysis identified accessions BGH-6749, BGH-5639, and BGH-219 as those with the earliest flowering. Accessions BGH-5455A and BGH-5598A had the highest carotenoid content, with averages greater than 170.00 \u03bcg g-1 of fresh mass. With a productivity of 0.13 t ha-1, accessions BGH-5485A, BGH-4610A, and BGH-5472A were the most promising for seed oil production. These last two accessions corresponded to those with higher seed productivity, averaging 0.58 and 0.54 t ha-1, respectively. This study confirms the high potential of this germplasm for use in breeding for promotion of earlier flowering and increase in total carotenoid content of the fruit pulp and in seed and seed oil productivity.","The obesity epidemic has now spread worldwide. With increase in weight, there is an increase in dysregulated energy metabolism ultimately leading to dysfunction of multiple organ systems recognized as the metabolic syndrome. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common form of chronic liver disease worldwide, and is thought to be the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome. It is a nondiscriminating disease affecting both children and adults and no socioeconomic class is spared. There is a well-defined increase in both liver-related and all-cause mortality. Current projections foresee a continued worsening in prevalence, especially with the increased rate of childhood obesity. Prevention would be the ultimate goal, but with continued trends in obesity, therapeutic options are needed to manage this chronic liver disease and prevent its complications of cirrhosis and even hepatocellular carcinoma. Therapies will need to be affordable, tolerable, and safe to be useful on such a large scale. This article will discuss some of the basic understanding of NAFLD, as well as review the currently tested therapies, some novel therapies, and potential future therapeutic options. ","Thiamin and thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP) are essential components for the function of enzymes involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates and amino acids in living organisms. In addition to its role as a cofactor, thiamin plays a key role in resistance against biotic and abiotic stresses in plants. Most of the studies used exogenous thiamin to enhance stress tolerance in plants. In this study, we achieved this objective by genetically engineering Arabidopsis thaliana and Camelina sativa for the seed-specific co-overexpression of the Arabidopsis thiamin biosynthetic genes Thi4, ThiC, and ThiE. Elevated thiamin content in the seeds of transgenic plants was accompanied by the enhanced expression levels of transcripts encoding thiamin cofactor-dependent enzymes. Furthermore, seed germination and root growth in thiamin over-producing lines were more tolerant to oxidative stress caused by salt and paraquat treatments. The transgenic seeds also accumulated more oil (up to16.4% in Arabidopsis and17.9% in C. sativa) and carbohydrate but less protein than the control seeds. The same results were also observed in TPP over-producing Arabidopsis plants generated by the seed-specific overexpression of TPK1. Together, our findings suggest that thiamin and TPP over-production in transgenic lines confer a boosted abiotic stress tolerance and alter the seed carbon partitioning as well.","Background and Purpose Vitamin A is depleted during infections. Vitamin A has been used successfully in measles, RSV and AIDS patients and is an effective vaccine adjuvant. In this study, low retinol levels were found in patients with severe COVID-19. Retinoid signaling impairment in COVID-19 disrupts Type-I interferon synthesis.","Background Given its antioxidant activity, vitamin E is hypothesized to attenuate the age-related decline in pulmonary function.","It is well known that terrestrial environments host an immense microbial biodiversity. Exposed to different types of stress, such as UV radiation, temperature fluctuations, water availability and the inter- / intra-specific competition for resources, terrestrial microorganisms have been evolved to produce a large spectrum of bioactive molecules. Bacteria, archaea, protists, fungi and algae have shown a high potential of producing biomolecules for pharmaceutical or other industrial purposes as they combine a sustainable, relatively low-cost and fast-production process. Herein, we provide an overview of the different bioactive molecules produced by terrestrial microorganisms with skin protecting applications. The high content in polyphenolic and carotenoid compounds produced by several strains, as well as the presence of exopolysaccharides, melanins, indole and pyrrole derivatives, mycosporines, carboxylic acids and other molecules, are discussed in the context of their antioxidant, photo-protective and skin-whitening activity. Relevant biotechnological tools developed for the enhanced production of high added value natural products, as well as the protecting effect of some antioxidant, hydrolytic and degrading enzymes are also discussed. Furthermore, we describe classes of microbial compounds that are used or have the potential to be used as antimicrobials, moisturizers, biosurfactants, pigments, flavorings and fragrances. ","Abstract Schizophrenia (SZ) is a brain disorder that has been intensively studied for over a century; yet, its etiology and multifactorial pathophysiology remain a puzzle. However, significant advances have been made in identifying numerous abnormalities in key biochemical systems. One among these is the antioxidant defense system (AODS) and redox signaling. This review summarizes the findings to date in human studies. The evidence can be broadly clustered into three major themes: perturbations in AODS, relationships between AODS alterations and other systems (i.e., membrane structure, immune function, and neurotransmission), and clinical implications. These domains of AODS have been examined in samples from both the central nervous system and peripheral tissues. Findings in patients with SZ include decreased nonenzymatic antioxidants, increased lipid peroxides and nitric oxides, and homeostatic imbalance of purine catabolism. Reductions of plasma antioxidant capacity are seen in patients with chronic illness as well as early in the course of SZ. Notably, these data indicate that many AODS alterations are independent of treatment effects. Moreover, there is burgeoning evidence indicating a link among oxidative stress, membrane defects, immune dysfunction, and multineurotransmitter pathologies in SZ. Finally, the body of evidence reviewed herein provides a theoretical rationale for the development of novel treatment approaches. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 15, 2011-2035. ","Evidence suggests that lung structure and function is partly maintained by a balance between the competing arginine-metabolizing enzymes arginase and nitric oxide synthase. Asymmetric dimethylarginine is an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase. It is metabolized by dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase-2, which is oxidant-sensitive. The mechanism that induces excess lung collagen deposition in burned patients has not yet been explored. Our objective is to investigate the role of asymmetric dimethylarginine and the arginase pathway in acute lung injury. An ovine model for burn and smoke inhalation injury was used to assess excess lung collagen deposition. Sheep were deeply anesthetized during the injury, mechanically ventilated, resuscitated with fluid, and sacrificed after either 2 or 3 weeks. Lungs were assessed histologically and biochemically for collagen content, arginase activity, lipid peroxidation product and antioxidant concentration, and protein concentrations. Plasma was assessed for amino acid and nitrate/nitrite concentrations. Burn and inhalation injury resulted in significantly reduced pulmonary function and increased lung collagen deposition. These physiological changes were associated with significantly increased lung arginase activity, collagen synthesis precursor ornithine aminotransferase, and ornithine decarboxylase, which is associated with cell proliferation. Significant decreases in plasma nitrate/nitrite after injury were associated with increased lung asymmetric dimethylarginine concentrations and decreased dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase-2 expression. The decreased dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase-2 expression was associated with significantly increased lipid peroxidation product and decreased antioxidant content in the lung. This data supports that excess lung collagen deposition and reduced pulmonary function in acute lung injury following burn and inhalation injury is mediated through the arginase pathway. ","The brain\u2019s remarkable capacity to process spoken language virtually in real time requires fast and efficient information processing machinery. In this study, we investigated how frequency-specific brain dynamics relate to models of probabilistic language prediction during auditory narrative comprehension. We recorded MEG activity while participants were listening to auditory stories in Dutch. Using trigram statistical language models, we estimated for every word in a story its conditional probability of occurrence. On the basis of word probabilities, we computed how unexpected the current word is given its context (word perplexity) and how (un)predictable the current linguistic context is (word entropy). We then evaluated whether source-reconstructed MEG oscillations at different frequency bands are modulated as a function of these language processing metrics. We show that theta-band source dynamics are increased in high relative to low entropy states, likely reflecting lexical computations. Beta-band dynamics are increased in situations of low word entropy and perplexity possibly reflecting maintenance of ongoing cognitive context. These findings lend support to the idea that the brain engages in the active generation and evaluation of predicted language based on the statistical properties of the input signal.","Vitamin A plays important roles in vision, cellular differentiation, embryonic development, reproduction, growth, and the immune system. Women living in developing countries are at increased risk of undernutrition during pregnancy due to poverty, poor diet quality and quantity, and high fertility rate. Dietary quality and diversity reflect adequacy of vitamin A whereby reduce the risk of vitamin A deficiency. The aim of study was to determine adequacy of vitamin A among pregnant women attending antenatal care in health facilities of Dessie town, Ethiopia, January, 2017. Health facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 390 women that attended antenatal care in Dessie town. The 9 food groups from FAO based on 24hours dietary recall was used for data collection. Adequacy of vitamin A was determined from nutrient adequacy ratio after obtaining report of nutrient intake from food composition table version III and IV in terms of B carotene and retinol equivalent respectively, based on estimated average requirement recommendation of vitamin A, 370 RE/day for pregnant women. Multivariable Logistic regression analysis was done after dichotomizing the dependent variables.","Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and is hallmarked by \u03b2-amyloid plaque and neurofibrillary tangles deposition in the central nervous system. The complex mechanism that underlies AD pathogenesis has made the development of a definitive cure futile. Exploring the possible therapeutic advantages of combining two neuromodulatory molecules with different mechanisms of neuroprotection is an interesting way of drug discovery. Ascorbic acid (AA), a potent antioxidant molecule, and nicotine (NIC), an allosteric modulator of nAChRs, have both been documented to independently proffer neuroprotection in experimental and clinical neurodegenerative cases. This study elucidated the putative therapeutic advantages of combining ascorbic acid and nicotine as a treatment regimen against the aluminium-induced Alzheimer-like corticohippocampal histopathology, anxiety, and perturbed neuroenergetics in rats induced with","Objectives Preparations containing saw palmetto berries are used in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). There are many products on the market, and relatively little is known about their chemical variability and specifically the composition and quality of different saw palmetto products notwithstanding that in 2000, an international consultation paper from the major urological associations from the five continents on treatments for BPH demanded further research on this topic. Here, we compare two analytical approaches and characterise 57 different saw palmetto products. Methods An established method - gas chromatography - was used for the quantification of nine fatty acids, while a novel approach of metabolomic profiling using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used as a fingerprinting tool to assess the overall composition of the extracts. Key findings The phytochemical analysis determining the fatty acids showed a high level of heterogeneity of the different products in the total amount and of nine single fatty acids. A robust and reproducible 1H NMR spectroscopy method was established, and the results showed that it was possible to statistically differentiate between saw palmetto products that had been extracted under different conditions but not between products that used a similar extraction method. Principal component analysis was able to determine those products that had significantly different metabolites. Conclusions The metabolomic approach developed offers novel opportunities for quality control along the value chain of saw palmetto and needs to be followed further, as with this method, the complexity of a herbal extract can be better assessed than with the analysis of a single group of constituents. ","","Background: Plants of Labiatae are used in traditional medicine and phytotherapy. Rosmarinic acid (RA) is a phenolic compound which is found in many genus of Labiatae and exhibits important biological activities. Materials and Methods: In this investigation, RA contents of 29 species of Labiatae named Salvia officinalis, Salvia limbata, Salvia virgata, Salvia hypoleuca, Salvia macrosiphon, Salvia choloroleuca, Melissa officinalis, Origanum vulgare, Lavandula angustifolia, Rosmarinus officinalis, Thymus daenensis, Thymus citriodorous, Thymus pubescens, Thymus vulgaris, Zataria multiflora, Mentha piperita, Mentha pulegium, Mentha longifolia, Mentha spicata, Mentha aquatica, Mentha crispa, Perovskia artemisoides, Zhumeria majdae, Satureja hortensis, Satureja khuzistanica, Satureja bachtiarica, Satureja atropatana, Satureja mutica and Satureja macrantha were determined by using high-performance liquid chromatographic method. Results: The results showed that RA content in different species of Labiatae was 0.0-58.5 mg g-1 of dried plants. The highest amount of RA was found in Mentha species especially M. spicata. Conclusion: M. spicata can be considered as a new source of rosmarinic acid . ","Background Zizyphus lotus L. (Desf.) also known as Jujube, is a deciduous shrub which belongs to Rhamnaceae family. This plant is used in Algerian traditional medicine for its anti-diabetic, sedative, analgesic, anti-inflammatory and hypoglycaemic activities. In the present study, we determined the concentrations of different vitamins (vitamin A, C and E) and fatty acids in root, stem, leaves, fruit pulp and seed of Zizyphus lotus L. (Desf.) and assessed the effects of their aqueous extracts on antioxidant status and human T-cell proliferation. Methods Aqueous filtrates from different parts, i.e, root, leaf, stem, fruit pulp and seed, of Zizyphus lotus L. (Desf.) were prepared. Vitamin C levels were determined by precipitating with 10% trichloroacetic acid and vitamin A and E were assessed by HPLC. Lipid composition of these extracts was determined by gas-liquid chromatography. Anti-oxidant capacity was evaluated by using anti-radical resistance kit [Kit Radicaux Libres (KRL@; Kirial International SA, Couternon, France)]. T-cell blastogenesis was assessed by the incorporation of 3H-thymidine. IL-2 gene expression was evaluated by RT-qPCR. Results Our results show that fruit pulp contained higher vitamin A and C contents than other parts of the plant. Furthermore, the fruit pulp was the richest source of linoleic acid (18:2n-6), a precursor of n-6 fatty acids. Fruit seeds possessed higher vitamin C levels than leaves, roots and stem. The leaves were the richest source of vitamin E and linolenic acid (18:3n-3), a precursor of n-3 fatty acids. The antioxidant capacity of the different extracts, measured by KRL@ test, was as follows: pulp &lt; seed&lt;leaf&lt;root &lt; stem. As far as T-cell proliferation is concerned, we observed that the different extracts of Zizyphus lotus L. (Desf.) exerted immunosuppressive effects. Conclusion Seed extracts exerted the most potent immunosuppressive effects on T cell proliferation and IL-2 mRNA expression. The results of the present study are discussed in the light of their use to modulate the immune-mediated diseases. ","Importance Effective therapeutics for Alzheimer\u2019s disease and mild cognitive impairment are needed.","Diabetic neuropathy (DN) is a multifactor complication of diabetes. It is a late finding in type 1 diabetes, but can be an early finding in type 2 diabetes. The cause of DN is still unclear and, like other complications of diabetes, it may be the result of various pathological conditions. Animal models and biomarkers of DN have been extensively used in neuropathic research. The most useful model of DN should exhibit the key feature present in human pathology. Diabetic rodents show behavioral, functional, structural and molecular biomarkers and they are widely used as models to investigate the etiology of DN as well as to screen the efficacy of the potential therapeutic interventions. We have reviewed the different animal models and biomarkers of neuropathy in diabetic rodents of either type 1 or type 2 diabetes. ","Background: Dementia is a syndrome characterized by progressive cognitive impairment that interferes with independent function in daily activities. Symptoms of dementia depend on its cause and vary greatly between individuals. There is extensive evidence supporting a relationship between diet and cognitive functions. This systematic review studies the efficacy of using vitamin supplements in the diet as a solution to nutritional deficiencies and the prevention of dementia and mild cognitive impairment. Methods: An intensive search of different databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane CENTRAL) was performed. Articles that were published between 2011 and November 2021 were retrieved using the mentioned search strategy. This systematic review has been conducted according to the PRISMA statement. Results: Folic acid supplementation proved to have better outcomes on cognitive tests than their respective control groups. The combined supplementation of folic acid and vitamin B12 showed some discrepancies between studies. Thiamine as supplementation did not only prove to have a positive impact on cognitive performance when given alone but also when given in combination with folic acid. Regarding vitamin D supplementation, the results observed were not so encouraging. A concomitant supplementation of low-dose vitamin E and vitamin C was also not associated with an improvement of cognitive function. Conclusions: The findings of this systematic review suggest that supplementation of B Complex vitamins, especially folic acid, may have a positive effect on delaying and preventing the risk of cognitive decline. Ascorbic acid and a high dose of vitamin E, when given separately, also showed positive effects on cognitive performance, but there is not sufficient evidence to support their use. The results of vitamin D supplementation trials are not conclusive in assessing the potential benefits that vitamin D might have on cognition. ","Background The rates of muscle aches, sprains, and inflammation are significantly increased during pregnancy. However, women are afraid to use systemic analgesics due to perceptions of fetal risks. Thus, topical products are important alternatives to consider for those women. Of interest, Professional Therapy MuscleCare (PTMC) has shown to be effective in alleviating the myofascial pain as reported in a randomized, placebo-controlled double-blinded comparative clinical study of five topical analgesics. However, to date, there is no complete review or long-term safety studies on the safety of these products during pregnancy and lactation. Thus, the aim of this article was to review toxicological, developmental, and reproductive effects associated with the use of PTMC products. Methods We performed a systematic review on safety of PTMC from all toxicological articles investigating the effects of PTMC's ingredients. This search was conducted through medical and toxicological databases including, Web of Science, EMBASE, Medline, and Micromedix. Both reported and theoretical adverse effects were extensively reviewed. Results Of the 1500 publications reviewed, 100 papers were retrieved and included in the review. Although some ingredients in PTMC products might cause adverse reproductive effects at high systemic doses, these doses are hundreds to thousands fold greater than those systemically available from topical use at the recommended maximum dose (i.e. 10 g/day). Conclusions This study provides evidence that, when used as indicated, PTMC is apparently safe for pregnant women and their unborn babies as well as for breastfed infants. ","Background Motor neuron disease (MND) is an incurable progressive neurodegenerative disease with limited treatment options. There is a pressing need for innovation in identifying therapies to take to clinical trial.","Moxifloxacin is central to treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Effects of moxifloxacin on Mycobacterium tuberculosis redox state were explored to identify strategies for increasing lethality and reducing the prevalence of extensively resistant tuberculosis. A non-invasive redox biosensor and an ROS-sensitive dye revealed that moxifloxacin induces oxidative stress correlated with M. tuberculosis death. Moxifloxacin lethality was mitigated by supplementing bacterial cultures with an ROS scavenger (thiourea), an iron chelator (bipyridyl), and, after drug removal, an antioxidant enzyme (catalase). Lethality was also reduced by hypoxia and nutrient starvation. Moxifloxacin increased the expression of genes involved in the oxidative stress response, iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis, and DNA repair. Surprisingly, and in contrast with Escherichia coli studies, moxifloxacin decreased expression of genes involved in respiration, suppressed oxygen consumption, increased the NADH/NAD+ ratio, and increased the labile iron pool in M. tuberculosis. Lowering the NADH/NAD+ ratio in M. tuberculosis revealed that NADH-reductive stress facilitates an iron-mediated ROS surge and moxifloxacin lethality. Treatment with N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) accelerated respiration and ROS production, increased moxifloxacin lethality, and lowered the mutant prevention concentration. Moxifloxacin induced redox stress in M. tuberculosis inside macrophages, and co-treatment with NAC potentiated the anti-mycobacterial efficacy of moxifloxacin during nutrient starvation, inside macrophages, and in mice where NAC restricted the emergence of resistance. Thus, oxidative stress, generated in a novel way, contributes to moxifloxacin-mediated killing of M. tuberculosis. The results open a way to make fluoroquinolones more effective anti-tuberculosis agents and provide a mechanistic basis for NAC-mediated enhancement of fluoroquinolone lethality in vitro and in vivo.","Perineuronal Nets (PNNs) are extracellular matrix (ECM) structures that envelop neurons and regulate synaptic functions. Long thought to be stable structures, PNNs have been recently shown to respond dynamically during learning, potentially regulating the formation of new synapses. We postulated that PNNs vary during sleep, a period of active synaptic modification. Notably, PNN components are cleaved by matrix proteases such as the protease cathepsin-S. This protease is diurnally expressed in the mouse cortex, coinciding with dendritic spine density rhythms. Thus, cathepsin-S may contribute to PNN remodeling during sleep, mediating synaptic reorganization. These studies were designed to test the hypothesis that PNN numbers vary in a diurnal manner in the rodent and human brain, as well as in a circadian manner in the rodent brain, and that these rhythms are disrupted by sleep deprivation. In mice, we observed diurnal and circadian rhythms of PNNs labeled with the lectin wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA+PNNs) in several brain regions involved in emotional memory processing. Sleep deprivation prevented the daytime decrease of WFA+ PNNs and enhances fear memory extinction. Diurnal rhythms of cathepsin-S expression in microglia were observed in the same brain regions, opposite to PNN rhythms. Finally, incubation of mouse sections with cathepsin-S eliminated PNN labeling. In humans, WFA+PNNs showed a diurnal rhythm in the amygdala and thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). Our results demonstrate that PNNs vary in a circadian manner and this is disrupted by sleep deprivation. We suggest that rhythmic modification of PNNs may contribute to memory consolidation during sleep.","Background There is an urgent need to increase global crop production. Identifying and combining genes controlling indidviual yield components, such as grain weight, holds the potential to enhance crop yields. Transcriptomics is a powerful tool to gain insights into the complex gene regulatory networks that underlie such traits, but relies on the availability of a high-quality reference sequence and accurate gene models. Previously, we identified a grain weight QTL on wheat chromosome 5A (5A QTL) which acts during early grain development to increase grain length through cell expansion in the pericarp. In this study, we performed RNA-sequencing on near isogenic lines (NILs) segregating for the 5A QTL and used the latest gene models to identify differentially expressed (DE) genes and pathways that potentially influence pericarp cell size and grain weight in wheat.","Nrf2 (nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2) is a basic region leucine-zipper transcription factor which binds to the antioxidant response element (ARE) and thereby regulates the expression of a large battery of genes involved in the cellular antioxidant and anti-inflammatory defence as well as mitochondrial protection. As oxidative stress, inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunctions have been identified as important pathomechanisms in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), this signaling cascade has gained interest both with respect to ALS pathogenesis and therapy. Nrf2 and Keap1 expressions are reduced in motor neurons in postmortem ALS tissue. Nrf2-activating compounds have shown therapeutic efficacy in the ALS mouse model and other neurodegenerative disease models. Alterations in Nrf2 and Keap1 expression and dysregulation of the Nrf2/ARE signalling program could contribute to the chronic motor neuron degeneration in ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, Nrf2 emerges as a key neuroprotective molecule in neurodegenerative diseases. Our recent studies strongly support that the Nrf2/ARE signalling pathway is an important mediator of neuroprotection and therefore represents a promising target for development of novel therapies against ALS, Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD).","Background It remains unsolved that whether blood uric acid (UA) is a neuroprotective or neurotoxic agent. This study aimed to evaluate the longitudinal association of blood UA with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) among older adults in China.","Post-weaning enteropathies in swine caused by pathogenic E. coli, such as post-weaning diarrhea (PWD) or edema disease (ED), remain a significant problem for the swine industry. Reduction in the use of antibiotics over concerns of antibiotic resistance and public health concerns, necessitate the evaluation of effective antibiotic alternatives to prevent significant loss of livestock and/or reductions in swine growth performance. For this purpose, an appropriate piglet model of enterotoxigenic E. coli enteropathy is required. In this study, we attempted to induce clinical signs of post-weaning disease in a piglet model using a one-time acute or lower daily chronic dose of a Shiga toxin\u2013producing and enterotoxigenic E. coli strain. The induced disease state was monitored by determining fecal shedding and colonization of the challenge strain, animal growth performance, cytokine levels, fecal calprotectin, histology, fecal metabolomics, and fecal microbiome shifts. The most informative analyses were colonization and shedding of the pathogen, serum cytokines, metabolomics, and targeted metagenomics to determine dysbiosis. Histopathological changes of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and tight junction leakage as measured by fecal calprotectin concentrations were not observed. Chronic dosing was similar to the acute regimen suggesting that a high dose of pathogen, as used in many studies, may not be necessary. The piglet disease model presented here can be used to evaluate alternative PWD treatment options. Furthermore, this relatively mild disease model presented here may be informative for modeling human chronic gastrointestinal diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, which otherwise require invasive procedures for study.","We previously reported xanthohumol (XN), and its synthetic derivative tetrahydro-XN (TXN) attenuates high-fat diet (HFD) induced obesity and metabolic syndrome in C57BL/6J mice. The objective of the current study was to determine the effect of XN and TXN on lipid accumulation in the liver. Non-supplemented mice were unable to adapt their caloric intake to 60% HFD, resulting in obesity and hepatic steatosis; however, TXN reduced weight gain and decreased hepatic steatosis. Liver transcriptomics indicated TXN might antagonize lipogenic PPAR\u03b3 actions in vivo. XN and TXN inhibited rosiglitazone-induced 3T3-L1 cell differentiation concomitant with decreased expression of lipogenesis-related genes. A PPAR\u03b3 competitive binding assay showed XN and TXN bind to PPAR\u03b3 with an IC50 similar to pioglitazone and 8-10 times stronger than oleate. Molecular docking simulations demonstrated XN and TXN bind in the PPAR\u03b3 ligand-binding domain pocket. Our findings are consistent with XN and TXN acting as antagonists of PPAR\u03b3.","","Background Few studies have evaluated the association between pre-existing vitamin D deficiency (VDD) and incident TB. We assessed the impact of baseline vitamin D on TB risk.","  It is known that the primary source of dietary vitamin C is fruit and\nvegetables and the plasma level of vitamin C has been considered a good\nsurrogate biomarker of vitamin C intake by fruit and vegetable consumption.

We employed Caenorhabditis elegans to investigate the possible beneficial effect of LAB (Lactobacillus bulgaricus) pretreatment against toxicity of graphene oxide (GO) and the underlying mechanisms. LAB prevented GO toxicity on the functions of both primary and secondary targeted organs in wild-type nematodes. LAB blocked translocation of GO into secondary targeted organs through intestinal barrier by maintaining normal intestinal permeability in wild-type nematodes. Moreover, LAB prevented GO damage on the functions of both primary and secondary targeted organs in exposed nematodes with mutations of susceptible genes (sod-2, sod-3, gas-1, and aak-2) to GO toxicity by sustaining normal intestinal permeability. LAB also sustained the normal defecation behavior in both wild-type nematodes and nematodes with mutations of susceptible genes. Therefore, the beneficial role of LAB against GO toxicity under different genetic backgrounds may be due to the combinational effects on intestinal permeability and defecation behavior. Moreover, the beneficial effects of LAB against GO toxicity was dependent on the function of ACS-22, homologous to mammalian FATP4 to mammalian FATP4. Our study provides highlight on establishment of pharmacological strategy to protect intestinal barrier from toxicity of GO. ","Although pentoxifylline (PTX) was identified as a competitive non-selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor, its pharmacological effect has not been clearly elucidated. The present study explored the effect of low dose 10 \u03bcg/mL PTX (therapeutic dose) compared to high dose 300 \u03bcg/mL PTX (experimental dose) in RAW 264.7 cells through immunoprecipitation-based high performance liquid chromatography (IP-HPLC), immunohistochemistry, and western blot. 10 \u03bcg/mL PTX increased the expression of proliferation (Ki-67, PCNA, cyclin D2, cdc25A), epigenetic modification (KDM4D, PCAF), protein translation (DOHH, DHPS, eIF5A1), RAS signaling (KRAS, pAKT1/2/3, PI3K), NFkB signaling (NFkB, GADD45, p38), protection (HSP70, SOD1, GSTO1/2), neuromuscular differentiation (NSE\u03b3, myosin-1a, desmin), osteoblastic differentiation (BMP2, RUNX2, osterix), acute inflammation (TNF\u03b1, IL-1, CXCR4), innate immunity (\u03b2-defensin 1, lactoferrin, TLR-3, -4), cell-mediated immunity (CD4, CD8, CD80), while decreased the expression of ER stress (eIF2\u03b1, eIF2AK3, ATF6\u03b1), fibrosis (FGF2, CTGF, collagen 3A1), and chronic inflammation (CD68, MMP-2, -3, COX2) versus the untreated controls. The activation of proliferation by 10 \u03bcg/mL PTX was also supported by the increase of cMyc-MAX heterodimer and \u03b2-catenin-TCF1 complex in double IP-HPLC. 10 \u03bcg/mL PTX enhanced FAS-mediated apoptosis but diminished p53-mediated apoptosis, and downregulated many angiogenesis proteins (angiogenin, VEGF-A, and FLT4), but upregulated HIF1\u03b1, VEGFR2, and CMG2 reactively. Whereas, 300 \u03bcg/mL PTX consistently decreased proliferation, epigenetic modification, RAS and NFkB signaling, neuromuscular and osteoblastic differentiation, but increased apoptosis, ER stress, and fibrosis compared to 10 \u03bcg/mL PTX. These data suggest PTX has different biological effect on RWA 264.7 cells depending on the concentration of 10 \u03bcg/mL and 300 \u03bcg/mL PTX. The low dose 10 \u03bcg/mL PTX enhanced RAS/NFkB signaling, proliferation, differentiation, and inflammation, particularly, it stimulated neuromuscular and osteoblastic differentiation, innate immunity, and cell-mediated immunity, but attenuated ER stress, fibrosis, angiogenesis, and chronic inflammation, while the high dose 300 \u03bcg/mL PTX was found to alleviate the 10 \u03bcg/mL PTX-induced biological effects, resulted in the suppression of RAS/NFkB signaling, proliferation, neuromuscular and osteoblastic differentiation, and inflammation.","Neurodegenerative diseases are debilitating, incurable disorders caused by progressive neuronal cell death. Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a blinding neurodegenerative disease that results in retinal photoreceptor cell death and progresses to the loss of the entire neural retinal network. We previously found that proteomic analysis of the adjacent vitreous serves as way to indirectly biopsy the neural retina and identify changes in the retinal proteome. We therefore analyzed protein expression in liquid vitreous biopsies from autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arRP) patients with PDE6A mutations and arRP mice with Pde6\u0251 mutations. Proteomic analysis of retina and vitreous samples identified molecular pathways affected at the onset of photoreceptor cell death. Based on affected molecular pathways, arRP mice were treated with a ketogenic diet or metabolites involved in fatty-acid synthesis, oxidative phosphorylation, and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Dietary supplementation of a single metabolite, \u0251-ketoglutarate, increased docosahexaeonic acid (DHA) levels, provided neuroprotection, and enhanced visual function in arRP mice. A ketogenic diet delayed photoreceptor cell loss, while vitamin B supplementation had a limited effect. Finally, desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (DESI-MSI) revealed restoration of key metabolites that correlated with our proteomic findings: pyrimidine and purine metabolism (uridine, dihydrouridine, and thymidine), glutamine and glutamate (glutamine/glutamate conversion), and succinic and aconitic acid (TCA cycle). This study demonstrates that replenishing TCA cycle metabolites via oral supplementation prolongs vision and provides a neuroprotective effect on the photoreceptor cells and inner retinal network.","Islet transplantation has the potential to cure type 1 diabetes. Despite recent therapeutic success, it is still not common because a large number of transpanted islets get damaged by multiple challenges including instant blood mediated inflammatory reaction, hypoxia/reperfusion injury, inflammatory cytokines, and immune rejection. RNA interference (RNAi) is an novel strategy to selectively degrade target mRNA. The use of RNAi technologies to downregulate the expression of harmful genes has the potential to improve the outcome of islet transplantation. The aim of this review is to gain a thorough understanding of biological obstacles to islet transplantation and discuss how to overcome these barriers using different RNAi technologies. This eventually will help improve islet survival and function post transplantaion. Chemically synthesized small interferring RNA (siRNA), vector based short haripin RNA (shRNA), and their critical design elements (such as sequences, promoters, backbone) are discussed. The application of combinatorial RNAi in islet transplantation is also discussed. Last but not the least, several delivery strategies for enhanced gene silencing are discussed, including chemical modification of siRNA, complex formation, bioconjugation, and viral vectors. ","The eye is particularly susceptible to oxidative stress and disruption of the delicate balance between oxygen-derived free radicals and antioxidants leading to many degenerative diseases. Attention has been called to all isoforms of vitamin E, with a-tocopherol being the most common form. Though similar in structure, each is diverse in antioxidant activity. Preclinical reports highlight vitamin E's influence on cell physiology and survival through several signaling pathways by activating kinases and transcription factors relevant for uptake, transport, metabolism, and cellular action to promote neuroprotective effects. In the clinical setting, population-based studies on vitamin E supplementation have been inconsistent at times and follow-up studies are needed. Nonetheless, vitamin E's health benefits outweigh the controversies. The goal of this review is to recognize the importance of vitamin E's role in guarding against gradual central vision loss observed in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The therapeutic role and molecular mechanisms of vitamin E's function in the retina, clinical implications, and possible toxicity are collectively described in the present review. ","No precision medicine models of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and associated mental comorbidities were developed to date. This observational 11study aimed to develop a precision nomothetic, data driven comorbid TLE model with endophenotype classes and pathways phenotypes that may have prognostic and therapeutical implications. We recruited forty healthy controls and 108 TLE patients for this research and assessed TLE and psychopathology (PP) features as well as oxidative stress (OSTOX, e.g., malondialdehyde or MDA, lipid hydroperoxides, and advanced oxidation protein products) and antioxidant (paraoxonase 1 or PON1 status, -SH groups, and total radical trapping potential or TRAP) biomarkers. A large part (57.2%) of the variance in a latent vector (LV) extracted from the above TLE and PP features was explained by these OSTOX and antioxidant biomarkers. The PON1 Q192R genetic variant showed indirect effects on this LV which were completely mediated by PON1 activity and MDA. Factor analysis showed that a common core could be extracted from TLE, PP, OSTOX and antioxidant scores, indicating that these features are manifestations of a common underlying construct, i.e., a novel pathway phenotype of TLE. Based on the latter we constructed a new phenotype class that is characterized by increased severity of TLE, PP and OSTOX features and lowered antioxidant defenses. A large part of the variance in episode frequency was explained by increased MDA, lowered antioxidant, and nitric oxide metabolite levels. In conclusion a) PP symptoms belong to the TLE phenome and signal increased severity; and b) cumulative effects of aldehyde formation and lowered antioxidants determine epileptogenic kindling.","Background and purpose To characterize patterns and outcomes of brain MR image changes after proton therapy (PT) for skull base head and neck cancer (HNC).","Background As mother-to-child-transmission of HIV decreases, and the population of infants who are born HIV-exposed, but uninfected (HEU) continues to rise, there is growing need to understand the development and health outcomes of infants who are HEU to ensure that they have the healthiest start to life.","Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae is a globally distributed pathogen that has been associated with pneumonia in both domestic and wild Caprinae. It is closely related to M. hyopneumoniae, a respiratory pathogen of swine that is associated with decreased growth rates of pigs as well as clinical respiratory disease. In order to assess the effects of M. ovipneumoniae on lamb performance, we generated a cohort of lambs free of M. ovipneumoniae by segregation of test negative ewes after lambing, then compared the growth and carcass quality traits of M. ovipneumoniae-free and -colonized lambs from weaning to harvest. Some signs of respiratory disease were observed during the feeding trial in both lamb groups, but the M. ovipneumoniae-exposed group included more affected lambs and higher average disease scores. At harvest, lungs of lambs in both groups showed few grossly visible lesions, although the M. ovipneumoniae-exposed group did exhibit increased microscopic lung lesions (P&lt;0.05). In addition, M. ovipneumoniae exposed lambs produced lower average daily gains (P&lt;0.05), and lower yield grade carcasses (P&lt;0.05) compared to those of non-exposed lambs. The results demonstrated the feasibility of test and segregation for elimination of M. ovipneumoniae from groups of sheep and suggested that this pathogen may impair lamb growth and productivity even in the absence of overt respiratory disease.","Background Preeclampsia is a multifaceted pregnancy-related disorder affecting women and fetuses. A link between preeclampsia, oxidative stress, and inflammation has been suggested. This study evaluated the interrelationship between biomarkers of oxidative stress, inflammation, and hematological parameters among preeclamptic Nigerian women. Material/Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 49 preeclamptic and 50 normotensive healthy pregnant women. Blood samples were obtained after 20-week gestation in all participants. Levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glutathione (GSH), malonaldehyde (MDA), total protein, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and cardiac-specific troponin I (cTnI) were determined by spectrophotometric and ELISA techniques. FBC, prothrombin time, and activated partial thromboplastin time were determined using an auto-analyzer, Quick's one-stage, and Proctor's and Rappaport's modification methods, respectively. Results The mean SOD (0.051+-0.050 vs. 0.073+-0.047, p 0.029), catalase (2.62+-1.93 vs. 8.48+-4.40, p&lt;0.001), GSH (49.05+-17.57 vs. 187.10+-56.07 p&lt;0.001), platelet (127.63+-89.75 vs. 267.16+-212.82, p&lt;0.001 were lower in preeclampsia. MDA (7.16+-5.00 vs. 2.91+-2.66, p&lt;0.001), cTnI (0.46+-0.31 vs. 0.13+-0.14 p&lt;0.001), PT (19.36+-4.06 vs. 13.45+-1.97 p&lt;0.001), APTT (45.53+-2.92 vs. 37.49+-4.99; p&lt;0.001) were higher in preeclampsia. Negative associations between SOD and MDA (r -0.527 p&lt;0.001), CAT and MDA (r -0.469, p 0.001) and positive associations between catalase and hs-CRP (r 0.844, p 0.029), RBC and HB (r 0.442, p 0.001), platelet, and SOD (r 0.353, p 0.013) were observed among preeclamptic volunteers. Conclusions Preeclampsia is associated with oxidative stress, derangement of hematological and coagulation homeostasis, as well as deleterious effects on the cardiovascular system. ","Polymer-multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) nanohybrids, which differ in surface charge have been synthesized to study the bioelectrocatalysis of adsorbed cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH) from Phanerochaete sordida on gold electrodes. To obtain negatively ...","Phylloquinone is a lipophilic naphthoquinone found predominantly in chloroplasts and best known for its function in photosystem I electron transport and disulfide bridge formation of photosystem II subunits. Phylloquinone has also been detected in plasma membrane preparations of heterotrophic tissues with potential transmembrane redox function, but the molecular basis for this noncanonical pathway is unknown. Here we provide evidence of plasma membrane phylloquinone biosynthesis in a nonphotosynthetic holoparasite Phelipanche aegyptiaca. A nonphotosynthetic and nonplastidial role for phylloquinone is supported by transcription of phylloquinone biosynthetic genes during seed germination and haustorium development, by plasma membrane-localization of alternative terminal enzymes, and by detection of phylloquinone in germinated seeds. Comparative gene network analysis with photosynthetically competent parasites revealed a bias of Phelipanche phylloquinone genes toward coexpression with oxidoreductases involved in plasma membrane electron transport. Genes encoding the plasma membrane phylloquinone pathway are also present in several photoautotrophic taxa of Asterids, suggesting an ancient origin of multifunctionality. Our findings suggest that nonphotosynthetic holoparasites exploit alternative targeting of phylloquinone for transmembrane redox signaling associated with parasitism.","While studying aspects of the sperm biology and immunity of two species of crickets, we encountered bacteria that were released from the male sperm container, the spermatophore, alongside sperm. We describe a presumably rich microbe flora in the sperm population (\u2018sperm-associated microbiota\u2019). These sperm-associated microbiota differed between the two species of cricket and between different populations and showed functional diversity. Further, sperm-associated microbiota killed sperm, highlighting their potential role in fitness, especially since they are most likely transferred to females during mating.","Abstract This study aimed to assess antihyperlipidemic, cardiac and antioxidant effects as well as mode of actions of Musa paradisiaca (M. paradisiaca) leaf and fruit peel hydroethanolic extracts in nicotinamide (NA)/streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Experimental diabetes mellitus was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of STZ (60 mg/kg body weight), 15 min after intraperitoneal injection of NA (120 mg/kg body weight). NA/STZ-induced diabetic rats were orally supplemented with M. paradisiaca leaf and fruit peel hydroethanolic extracts in a dose of 100 mg/kg body weight/day for 28 days. The treatment of NA/STZ-induced diabetic rats with M. paradisiaca leaf and fruit peel extracts significantly decreased the elevated fasting and post-prandial serum glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL-cholesterol and vLDL-cholesterol levels and significantly increased the lowered serum insulin level, liver glycogen content, serum HDL-cholesterol level, homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IS) and HOMA-b cell function. The elevated cardiovascular risk indices in diabetic rats were significantly improved due to treatment with M. paradisiaca extracts. Concomitant with the increase in liver glycogen content, the glucose-6-phosphatase activity significantly decreased reflecting the decrease in hepatic glucose output. The heart function was potentially ameliorated as manifested by decrease in the elevated serum creatine kinase-MB, lactate dehydrogenase and aspartate aminotransferase activities after treatments of diabetic rats with M. paradisiaca extracts. The elevated liver lipid peroxidation and the decline in liver glutathione content and superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione-S-transferase activities were significantly reversed by treatments. Thus, it can be concluded that M. paradisiaca leaf and fruit peel hydroethanolic extracts may have antihyperlipidemic and cardioprotective potentials in NA/STZ-induced diabetic rats. These effects may be mediated via improvements in the glycemic state, b-cell function, tissue insulin sensitivity, and antioxidant defense mechanism. ","Although a defective vitamin D pathway has been widely suspected to be associated in SARS-CoV-2 pathobiology, the status of the vitamin D pathway and vitamin D-modulated genes in lung cells of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown. To understand the significance of the vitamin D pathway in SARS-CoV-2 pathobiology, computational approaches were applied to transcriptomic datasets from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cells of such patients or healthy individuals. Levels of vitamin D receptor, retinoid X receptor, and CYP27A1 in BALF cells of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 were found to be reduced. Additionally, 107 differentially expressed, predominantly downregulated genes modulated by vitamin D were identified in transcriptomic datasets from patient\u2019s cells. Further analysis of differentially expressed genes provided eight novel genes with a conserved motif with vitamin D-responsive elements, implying the role of both direct and indirect mechanisms of gene expression by the dysregulated vitamin D pathway in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Network analysis of differentially expressed vitamin D-modulated genes identified pathways in the immune system, NF-KB/cytokine signaling, and cell cycle regulation as top predicted pathways that might be affected in the cells of such patients. In brief, the results provided computational evidence to implicate a dysregulated vitamin D pathway in the pathobiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Markers of biological ageing have potential utility in primary care and public health. We developed an elastic net regression model of age based on untargeted metabolic profiling across multiple platforms, including nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in urine and serum (almost 100,000 features assayed), within a large sample (N=2,239) from the UK occupational Airwave cohort. We investigated the determinants of accelerated ageing, including genetic, lifestyle and psychological risk factors for premature mortality. The metabolomic age model was well correlated with chronological age (r=0.85 in independent test set). Increased metabolomic age acceleration (mAA) was associated (p&lt;0.0025) with overweight/obesity and depression and nominally associated (p&lt;0.05) with high alcohol use and low income. DNA methylation age acceleration (N=1,102) was nominally associated (p&lt;0.05) with high alcohol use, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder, but not correlated with mAA. Biological age acceleration may present an important mechanism linking psycho-social stress to age-related disease.","Supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), which has received much interest in its use and further development for industrial applications, is a method that offers some advantages over conventional methods, especially for the palm oil industry. SC-CO2 refers to supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) that uses carbon dioxide (CO2) as a solvent which is a nontoxic, inexpensive, nonflammable, and nonpolluting supercritical fluid solvent for the extraction of natural products. Almost 100% oil can be extracted and it is regarded as safe, with organic solvent-free extracts having superior organoleptic profiles. The palm oil industry is one of the major industries in Malaysia that provides a major contribution to the national income. Malaysia is the second largest palm oil and palm kernel oil producer in the World. This paper reviews advances in applications of supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) extraction of oils from natural sources, in particular palm oil, minor constituents in palm oil, producing fractionated, refined, bleached, and deodorized palm oil, palm kernel oil and purified fatty acid fractions commendable for downstream uses as in toiletries and confectionaries. ","Cardiovascular disorder is one of the causes of death globally. Quite a number of medicinal plants have been demonstrated to possess and exhibit beneficial effects on cardiovascular system throuhg their antioxidant properties. The study investigated the in vivo antioxidant properties of aqueous C. albidium pulp extract on isoproterenol-induced cardiotoxicity in albino rats. Cardiotoxicity was induced in rats by subcutaneous injection of ISO (85 mg/kg bwt) into adult albino rats and treated with the extract (100 and 200 mg/kg bwt). The levels of nitrite, lipid peroxidation, reduced glutathione total protein and activities of glutathione peroxidase, catalase and superoxide dismutase were evaluated using standard methods. The concentration of total protein was also determined. Administration of ISO (85 mg/kg body weight) caused significant (p &lt; 0.05) reduction in the antioxidant status of animals. The enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants perturbed by the administration of ISO were restored in the C. albidium treated rats. The study concludes that the aqueous extract of C. albidum pulp protected against Isoproterenol-induced cardiotoxicity in adult male Albino rats.","Importance General health checks\u2014also known as general medical exams, periodic health evaluations, checkups, or wellness visits\u2014to identify and prevent disease are extremely common in adult primary care. Although general health checks are often expected and advocated by patients, clinicians, payers, and health systems, others question their value. The current evidence was updated and recommendations provided for conducting general health checks in adults.","Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) remodels corneal stroma to compensate refractive errors. The removal of epithelium and the ablation of stroma provoke the disruption of corneal nerves and a release of several peptides from tears, epithelium, stroma and nerves. A myriad of cytokines, growth factors, and matrix metalloproteases participate in the process of corneal wound healing. Their balance will determine if reepithelization and stromal remodeling are appropriate. The final aim is to achieve corneal transparency for restoring corneal function, and a proper visual quality. Therefore, wound-healing response is critical for a successful refractive surgery. Our goal is to provide an overview into how corneal wounding develops following PRK. We will also review the influence of intraoperative application of mitomycin C, bandage contact lenses, anti-inflammatory and other drugs in preventing corneal haze and post-PRK pain. ","Objective The present study aimed to investigate the ameliorative effect of melittin, a major polypeptide in the venom of honeybee (Apis mellifera) on isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RIF) induced hepatotoxicity in male albino rats. Method: The rats (140-200g) were divided into five groups (n=6): normal control (NC); toxic (T) group treated with INH+RIF (100 mg/kg, p.o.); melittin-treated (Mel15, Mel30) group (15 or 30 \u00b5g/kg s.c); and normal recovery (NR) group. Blood and liver samples were collected for biochemical, hematological and histopathological studies respectively.","Ficus hispida (FH) Linn. is a moderate sized tree found throughout the year and is grown wild or cultivated for its edible fruits and folklore value. Traditionally, different parts of the plant have been used in the treatment of ulcers, psoriasis, anemia, piles jaundice, vitiligo, hemorrhage, diabetes, convulsion, hepatitis, dysentery, biliousness, and as lactagogue and purgative. FH contains wide varieties of bioactives from different phytochemical groups like alkaloids, carbohydrates, proteins and amino acids, sterols, phenols, flavonoids, gums and mucilage, glycosides, saponins, and terpenes. Various scientific works have been published to establish the scientific basis of traditional medicinal values attributed to FH. Furthermore, newer pharmacological activities like antineoplastic, cardioprotective, neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects were also reported recently. Till now, no work has been published to elaborate the pharmacognostic features of FH Linn. The present review is, therefore, an effort to give a detailed account on its pharmacognosy and phytochemistry, and an extensive survey on its pharmacological activities. Moreover, we are trying to establish the mechanism of action behind its earlier reported pharmacology. The review also looks at the future formulation based delivery approaches of its lipophilic bioactives, which is done to enhance its dissolution so as to increase its bioavailability, and thus the associated pharmacological action. ","Despite the accumulating evidence that increased consumption of ultra-processed food has adverse health implications, it remains difficult to decide what constitutes processed food. Indeed, the current processing-based classification of food has limited coverage and does not differentiate between degrees of processing, hindering consumer choices and slowing research on the health implications of processed food. Here we introduce a machine learning algorithm that accurately predicts the degree of processing for any food, indicating that over 73% of the U.S. food supply is ultra-processed. We show that the increased reliance of an individual\u2019s diet on ultra-processed food correlates with higher risk of metabolic syndrome, diabetes, angina, elevated blood pressure and biological age, and reduces the bio-availability of vitamins. Finally, we find that replacing foods with less processed alternatives can significantly reduce the health implications of ultra-processed food, suggesting that access to information on the degree of processing, currently unavailable to consumers, could improve population health.","Little is known about how normal variation in dietary patterns in humans affects the aging process, largely because both nutrition and the physiology of aging are highly complex and multidimensional. Here, we apply the nutritional geometry framework to data from 1560 older adults followed over four years to assess how nutrient intake patterns affect the aging process. Aging was quantified via blood biomarkers integrated to measure loss of homeostasis. Additionally, we extend nutritional geometry to 19 micronutrients. Salient results include benefits of intermediate protein and vitamin E intake. Broadly, we show that there are few simple answers of \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d nutrients \u2013 optimal levels are generally intermediate, but dependent on other nutrients. Simpler linear/univariate analytical approaches are insufficient to capture such associations. We present an interactive tool to explore the results, and our approach presents a roadmap for future studies to explore the full complexity of the nutrition-aging landscape.","The in vitro and in vivo evidence compatible with a role for oxidative stress in OTA carcinogenicity has been collected and described. Several potential oxido-reduction mechanisms have been identified in the past. More recently, the possibility of a reduction of cellular antioxidant defense has been raised as an indirect source of oxidative stress. Consequences resulting from the production of oxidative stress are observed at different levels. First, OTA exposure has been associated with increased levels of oxidative DNA, lipid, and protein damage. Second, various biological processes known to be mobilized under oxidative stress were shown to be altered by OTA. These effects have been observed in both in vitro and in vivo test systems. In vivo, active doses were often within doses documented to induce renal tumors in rats. In conclusion, the evidence for the induction of an oxidative stress response resulting from OTA exposure can be considered strong. Because the contribution of the oxidative stress response in the development of cancers is well established, a role in OTA carcinogenicity is plausible. Altogether, the data reviewed above support the application of a threshold-based approach to establish safe level of dietary human exposure to OTA. ","Stony coral tissue loss disease, first observed in Florida in 2014, has now spread along the entire Florida Reef Tract and on reefs in many Caribbean countries. The disease affects a variety of coral species with differential outcomes, and in many instances results in whole-colony mortality. We employed untargeted metabolomic profiling of Montastraea cavernosa corals affected by stony coral tissue loss disease to identify metabolic markers of disease. Herein, extracts from apparently healthy, diseased, and recovered corals, Montastraea cavernosa, collected at a reef site near Ft. Lauderdale, Florida were subjected to liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry-based metabolomics. Unsupervised principal component analysis reveals wide variation in metabolomic profiles of healthy corals of the same species, which differ from diseased corals. Using a combination of supervised and unsupervised data analyses tools, we describe metabolite features that explain variation between the apparently healthy corals, between diseased corals, and between the healthy and the diseased corals. By employing a culture-based approach, we assign sources of a subset of these molecules to the endosymbiotic dinoflagellates, Symbiodiniaceae. Specifically, we identify various endosymbiont-specific lipid classes, such as betaine lipids, glycolipids, and tocopherols, which differentiate samples taken from apparently healthy corals and diseased corals. Given the variation observed in metabolite fingerprints of corals, our data suggests that metabolomics is a viable approach to link metabolite profiles of different coral species with their susceptibility and resilience to numerous coral diseases spreading through reefs worldwide.","Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the precentral hand knob can evoke motor evoked potentials (MEP) in contralateral hand muscles. Biophysical modelling points to the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) in the superficial crown-lip region as primary site of TMS-induced neuronal excitation. Here, we used a sulcus-aligned MRI-informed TMS mapping approach to determine the optimal site (hotspot) for evoking MEPs in the precentral hand knob. Individual precentral hotspot location varied along the rostro-caudal axis. Individuals with a more rostral location had longer MEP latencies. Spatiotemporal \u201chotspot rostrality\u201d was associated with higher precentral myelin-related signals, stronger movement-related activation of PMd in the precentral crown, and higher temporal precision during paced finger tapping. Together, our multimodal mapping approach provides first-time evidence for behaviourally relevant, structural and functional phenotypic variation in the crown of human precentral motor hand knob. The results have important implications for physiological and interventional TMS studies targeting the precentral hand knob.","Abstract In this study, a series of naringenin-O-alkylamine derivatives were designed and obtained by introducing an alkylamine fragment into the naringenin skeleton. The in vitro biological activity results revealed that compounds 5f and 7k showed good antioxidant activity with ORAC values of 2.3eq and 1.2eq, respectively. Compounds 5f and 7k were reversible and excellent huAChE inhibitors with IC50 values of 0.91 mM and 0.57 mM, respectively. Moreover, compounds 5f and 7k could inhibit self-induced Ab1-42 aggregation with 62.1% and 43.8% inhibition rate, respectively, and significantly inhibited huAChE-Ab1-40 aggregation with 51.7% and 43.4% inhibition rate, respectively. In addition, compounds 5f and 7k were selective metal chelators and remarkably inhibited Cu2+-induced Ab1-42 aggregation with 73.5% and 68.7% inhibition rates, respectively. Furthermore, compounds 5f and 7k could cross the blood-brain barrier in vitro and displayed good neuroprotective effects and anti-inflammatory properties. Further investigation showed that compound 5f did not show obvious hepatotoxicity and displayed a good hepatoprotective effect by its antioxidant activity. The in vivo study displayed that compound 5f significantly improved scopolamine-induced mice memory impairment. Therefore, compound 5f was a potential multifunctional candidate for the treatment of AD. ","The dwindling drug pipeline is driving increased interest in the use of genome datasets to inform drug treatment. In particular, networks based on transcript data and protein-protein interactions have been used to design therapies that employ drug combinations. But there has been less focus on employing human genetic interaction networks constructed from copy number alterations (CNAs). These networks can be charted with sensitivity and precision by seeking gene pairs that tend to be amplified and/or deleted in tandem, even when they are located at a distance on the genome. Our experience with radiation hybrid (RH) panels, a library of cell clones that have been used for genetic mapping, have shown this tool can pinpoint statistically significant patterns of co-inherited gene pairs. In fact, we were able to identify gene pairs specifically associated with the mechanism of cell survival at single gene resolution. The strategy of seeking correlated CNAs can also be used to map survival networks for cancer. Although the cancer networks have lower resolution, the RH network can be leveraged to provide single gene specificity in the tumor networks. In a survival network for glioblastoma possessing single gene resolution, we found that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) oncogene interacted with 46 genes. Of these genes, ten (22%) happened to be targets for existing drugs. Here, we briefly review the previous use of molecular networks to design novel therapies. We then highlight the potential of using correlated CNAs to guide combinatorial drug treatment in common medical conditions. We focus on therapeutic opportunities in cancer, but also offer examples from autoimmune disorders and atherosclerosis.","The concern with human health has increased the interest in producing foods enriched with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), directly or naturally by inclusion in the animals\u2019 diet. The positive effects such as antithrombotic, anti-inflammatory, and hypolipidemic have been observed in pigs and rats, used as human models for study. The present study evaluated the effect of cow\u2019s milk with different lipid profiles on performance, serum fatty acid profile, biochemical analysis, and a complete blood count of gilts used as a human model. At 34 days, thirty gilts were equally distributed in three treatments. Experimental treatments were milk from cows without the oil supplementation (C), milk from cows fed an enriched diet with linseed oil (n-3), and milk from cows fed an enriched diet with soybean oil (n-6). Milk supplementation was performed until the age of 190 days, provided once in the morning. The n-3 and n-6 milk reduced the concentration of myristic acid in the blood and increased the leukocytes. Milk enriched with n-3 compared to n-6 reduced stearic acid. In conclusion, milk with a better PUFA profile can reduce saturated fatty acids in the blood and alter the concentration of cells in the defense system.","Background Reprogramming of somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and subsequent differentiation into iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iCM) seems to be a promising strategy for cardiac regenerative therapy. However, recent failure or poor outcomes in cardiac cell therapy warrants further investigation focusing on the infarction/wound environment (site of healing) to improve the cardiac regenerative medicine. Here, using next generation sequencing (NGS), we analyzed the global transcriptome to discover the unidentified genes/pathways that are crucial for cell survival, cytoprotection and mitochondrial dynamics during the differentiation of iPSC into iCM.","Symptoms and complications associated with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and organ damage have been linked to SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1-induced increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by immune cells. In this study, the effects of an extract of Garcinia kola seeds and garcinoic acid were investigated in SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1-stimulated human PBMCs. Results of ELISA experiments revealed that Garcinia kola extract (6.25, 12.5 and 25 \u03bcg/mL) and garcinoic acid (1.25, 2.5 and 5 \u03bcM) significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1-induced increased secretion of TNF\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-8 in PBMCs. In-cell western assays showed that pre-treatment with Garcinia kola extract and garcinoic acid reduced elevated expressions of both phospho-p65 and phospho-\u03baB\u03b1 proteins, as well as NF-\u03baB DNA binding capacity and NF-\u03baB-driven luciferase expression following stimulation of PBMCs with spike glycoprotein S1. Furthermore, pre-treatment of PBMCs with Garcinia kola extract prior to stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1 resulted in reduced damage to adjacent A549 lung epithelial cells. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GCMS) and HPLC-PDA confirmed the presence of garcinoic acid in the Garcinia kola extract used in this study. These results suggest that the seed of Garcinia kola and garcinoic acid are natural products which may possess pharmacological/therapeutic benefits in reducing cytokine storm during the late stage of severe SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus infections.","The chemopreventive activity of celecoxib against colorectal cancer is limited to a proportion of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients who experience a response. The cause of this response variability and the potential mechanisms underlying these responses remain poorly understood. Preclinical studies showed that celecoxib increases the production of main oxidative metabolism product of linoleic acid, 13-S-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-S-HODE), to suppress colorectal tumorigenesis. We conducted a phase II clinical study to determine whether celecoxib increases 13-S-HODE production in colonic adenomas from FAP patients. Twenty seven FAP patients completed a 6-month oral course of 400 mg of celecoxib twice a day and had colonoscopies before and after celecoxib treatment to assess colorectal polyp tumor burden and obtain colorectal normal and polyp biopsies to measure celecoxib, 13-HODE, 15-HETE, 12-HETE, and LTB4 levels by LC/MS. Celecoxib levels in sera from those patients were also measured before treatment and 2, 4, and 6 months of treatment. Seventeen of the 27 patients experienced a response to celecoxib, with a more than 30% reduction of colonic polyp burden on the basis of a reproducible quantitative assessment of colonoscopy results. Celecoxib levels were significantly lower in polyp tissues than in normal colorectal tissues. Celecoxib levels in sera and normal colorectal tissues were correlated in patients who experienced a response to celecoxib but not in those who did not. Among the measured lipoxygenase products, only 13-HODE levels were significantly lower in polyp tissues than in normal tissues. Our findings demonstrate the differential bioavailability of celecoxib between normal and polyp tissues and its potential effects on clinical response in FAP patients.","Synopsis Objective The maintenance of youthful skin appearance is strongly desired by a large proportion of the world's population. The aim of the present study was therefore to evaluate the effect on skin wrinkling, of a combination of ingredients reported to influence key factors involved in skin ageing, namely inflammation, collagen synthesis and oxidative/UV stress. A supplemented drink was developed containing soy isoflavones, lycopene, vitamin C and vitamin E and given to post-menopausal women with a capsule containing fish oil. Method We have performed a double-blind randomized controlled human clinical study to assess whether this cocktail of dietary ingredients can significantly improve the appearance of facial wrinkles. Results We have shown that this unique combination of micronutrients can significantly reduce the depth of facial wrinkles and that this improvement is associated with increased deposition of new collagen fibres in the dermis. Conclusion This study demonstrates that consumption of a mixture of soy isoflavones, lycopene, vitamin C, vitamin E and fish oil is able to induce a clinically measureable improvement in the depth of facial wrinkles following long-term use. We have also shown, for the first time with an oral product, that the improvement is associated with increased deposition of new collagen fibres in the dermis.

Nous avons egalement montre, pour la premiere fois avec un produit oral, que l'amelioration est associee a une augmentation du depot de nouvelles fibres de collagene dans le derme. ","Background Phenotypic variability of human populations is partly the result of gene polymorphism and differential gene expression. As such, understanding the molecular basis for diversity requires identifying genes with both high and low population expression variance and identifying the mechanisms underlying their expression control. Key issues remain unanswered with respect to expression variability in human populations. The role of gene methylation as well as the contribution that age, sex and tissue-specific factors have on expression variability are not well understood.","Green tea is a popular beverage nowadays and intake of green tea polyphenols has shown preventive effect against cancer and cardiovascular disease in experimental and epidemiologic studies. Several studies have suggested that green tea catechins, such as epigallocatechin gallate, inhibit periodontal pathogens and reduce the destruction of periodontal tissue. This paper aims to review the role of green tea in inflammatory diseases, especially in periodontal diseases. ","Rationale and Objectives Although neuroimaging studies suggest that the cerebral ventricle is independently associated with APOE \u03b54, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, and neuropsychological scores in aging and Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), there is no formal synthesis of these findings. We summarized the association of ventricular changes with APOE \u03b54, CSF biomarkers, and neuropsychological measures.","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a lethal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the selective degeneration of defined subgroups of motoneuron in the brainstem, spinal cord and motor cortex with signature hallmarks of mitochondrial Ca2+ overload, free radical damage, excitotoxicity and impaired axonal transport. Although intracellular disruptions of cytosolic and mitochondrial calcium, and in particular low cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+]c) buffering and a strong interaction between metabolic mechanisms and [Ca2+]i have been identified predominantly in motoneuron impairment, the causes of these disruptions are unknown. The existing evidence suggests that the mutant superoxide dismutase1 (mtSOD1)-mediated toxicity in ALS acts through mitochondria, and that alteration in cytosolic and mitochondria-ER microdomain calcium accumulation are critical to the neurodegenerative process. Furthermore, chronic excitotoxcity mediated by Ca2+-permeable AMPA and NMDA receptors seems to initiate vicious cycle of intracellular calcium dysregulation which leads to toxic Ca2+ overload and thereby selective neurodegeneration. Recent advancement in the experimental analysis of calcium signals with high spatiotemporal precision has allowed investigations of calcium regulation in-vivo and in-vitro in different cell types, in particular selectively vulnerable/resistant cell types in different animal models of this motoneuron disease. This review provides an overview of latest advances in this field, and focuses on details of what has been learned about disrupted Ca2+ homeostasis and mitochondrial degeneration. It further emphasizes the critical role of mitochondria in preventing apoptosis by acting as a Ca2+ buffers, especially in motoneurons, in pathophysiological conditions such as ALS. ","Wheatgrass has emerged as a functional food source in recent years, but the detailed metabolomics basis for its health benefits remains poorly understood. In this study, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis were used to study the metabolic profiling of seedlings from wheat, barley, rye and triticale, which revealed 1800 features in positive mode and 4303 features in negative mode. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed clear differences between species, and 164 differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) were detected, including amino acids, organic acids, lipids, fatty acids, nucleic acids, flavonoids, amines, polyamines, vitamins, sugar derivatives and others. Unique metabolites in each species were identified. This study provides a glimpse into the metabolomics profiles of wheat and its wild relatives, which may form an important basis for nutrition, health and other parameters.","Ageing is the primary risk factor for AD; however, there is a poor understanding of the biological mechanisms by which the ageing process contributes to the development of AD in some individuals, while others progress to advanced age with relatively little AD neuropathology. To halt the progression of AD, the preclinical stage of neurodegeneration (before the onset of clinical symptoms) is anticipated to be the more effective time point for applying potentially disease-modifying interventions in AD. The main objective of this study was to understand the age and disease related proteomic changes are detectable in plasma, based on retrospective analysis of longitudinal data and cross-sectional analyses of clinically diagnosed cases. We conducted an in-depth plasma proteomics analysis using intensive depletion of high-abundant plasma proteins using the Agilent multiple affinity removal liquid chromatography (LC) column-Human 14 (Hu14) followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS PAGE) technique. In this study, we have begun to address the following questions; (1) differences in plasma proteomic profiles between normal ageing, vs ageing with progress to cognitive decline (MCI) or disease (dementia, probable AD), (2) cross-sectional analysis of baseline data, when all subjects are clinically identified as cognitively normal, provides insight into the preclinical changes which precede subsequent progression to AD and potentially provide early biomarkers, and (3) comparison of plasma at the point of progression to clinically diagnosed onset of cognitive decline or AD, can provide potential plasma biomarkers to facilitate clinical diagnosis. Furthermore, our findings also identified some proteins previously discovered in AD CSF and brain proteomics signatures that could provide clinically meaningful information. We identified differentially expressed proteins which were associated with several biological and molecular processes that may serve as therapeutic targets and fluid biomarkers for the disease.","Copper (Cu) is required for basically all biochemical and physiological processes in the body. The aim was to evaluate the effects of different sources of dietary copper on jejunal epithelium histomorphometry in adolescent rats. Male rats at the age of 5 weeks were used in the 12-week experiment. The control group was fed with standard diet providing the required Cu level (5 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day) in an inorganic form (sulfate) covered 100 % of daily demand, and the other three groups were supplemented with Cu-glycine complex covered 50, 75, and 100 % daily demand. Basal hematological and plasma biochemical analyses as well as histomorphometric examinations of the jejunal epithelium and liver were performed. Cu given in the organic form in 100 % of daily demand depressed the muscular and submucosa layer and the crypt depth (P &lt; 0.05) without an influence of the innervation of the jejunum. In turn, organic Cu given in 75 % of daily demand did not influence the intestinal morphology in adult rats. Dietary organic Cu given to rats covering the daily demand in 50 or 75 % appears to be less harmful with regard to the intestinal epithelium than when administered in 100 % of daily demand. ","IMPORTANCE Ocular complications in infants with Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS) have been reported. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying of eye dysfunctions are presently unknown.","","Samenvatting Tropische kindergeneeskunde is een geijkte, maar niet nauwkeurig omschreven term. De ernstige gezondheidsproblemen van kinderen in de tropen en subtropen vinden namelijk hun oorzaak eerder in armoede, ongeletterdheid en oorlogen dan in specifieke tropische condities. ","Although visual processing impairments have been explored in schizophrenia (SZ), their underlying neurobiology of the visual processing impairments has not been widely studied. Also, while some research has hinted at differences in information transfer and flow in SZ, there are few investigations of the dynamics of functional connectivity within visual networks. In this study, we analyzed resting-state fMRI data of the visual sensory network (VSN) in 160 healthy control (HC) subjects and 151 SZ subjects. We estimated 9 independent components within the VSN. Then, we calculated the dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) using the Pearson correlation. Next, using k-means clustering, we partitioned the dFNCs into five distinct states, and then we calculated the portion of time each subject spent in each state, that we termed the occupancy rate (OCR). Using OCR, we compared HC with SZ subjects and investigated the link between OCR and visual learning in SZ subjects. Besides, we compared the VSN functional connectivity of SZ and HC subjects in each state. We found that this network is indeed highly dynamic. Each state represents a unique connectivity pattern of fluctuations in VSN FNC, and all states showed significant disruption in SZ. Overall, HC showed stronger connectivity within the VSN in states. SZ subjects spent more time in a state in which the connectivity between the middle temporal gyrus and other regions of VNS is highly negative. Besides, OCR in a state with strong positive connectivity between middle temporal gyrus and other regions correlated significantly with visual learning scores in SZ.","Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) have low cholesterol absorption and, despite enhanced endogenous biosynthesis, low serum cholesterol. Herein, we investigated cholesterol metabolism in a murine CF model in comparison to wild type (WT) testing serum and liver surrogate biomarkers together with the hepatic expression of genes involved in cholesterol metabolism. CF mice display lower sterols absorption and increased endogenous biosynthesis. Subsequently, we evaluated the effects of a cholesterol-supplemented diet on cholesterol metabolism in CF and WT mice. The supplementation in WT mice determines biochemical changes similar to humans. Instead, CF mice with supplementation did not show significant changes, except for serum phytosterols (\u221250%), liver cholesterol (+35%) and TNF\u03b1 mRNA expression, that resulted 5-fold higher than in CF without supplementation. However, liver cholesterol in CF mice with supplementation resulted significantly lower compared to WT supplemented mice. This study shows that in CF mice there is a vicious circle in which the altered bile salts synthesis/secretion contribute to reduce cholesterol digestion/absorption. The consequence is the enhanced liver cholesterol biosynthesis that accumulates in the cell triggering inflammation.","Co-treatment of neuroprotective reagents may improve the therapeutic efficacy of hypothermia in protecting neurons during ischemic stroke. This study aimed to find promising drugs that enhance the neuroprotective effect of mild hypothermia (MH). 26 candidate drugs were selected based on different targets. Primary cultured cortical neurons were exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R) to induce neuronal damage, followed by either single treatment (a drug or MH) or a combination of a drug and MH. Results showed that, compared with single treatment, combination of MH with brain derived neurotrophic factor, glibenclamide, dizocilpine, human urinary kallidinogenase or neuroglobin displayed higher proportion of neuronal cell viability. The latter three drugs also caused less apoptosis rate in combined treatment. Furthermore, co-treatment of those three drugs and MH decreased the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and intracellular calcium accumulation, as well as stabilized mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), indicating the combined neuroprotective effects are probably via inhibiting mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Taken together, the study suggests that combined treatment with hypothermia and certain neuroprotective reagents provide a better protection against OGD/R-induced neuronal injury. ","Despite its severe toxicity and negative environmental impact, hexane remain the solvent of choice for the extraction of vegetable oils. This is in contrast with the constantly growing demand for sustainable and green extraction processes. In recent years a variety of alternatives to hexane have been reported, among them 2-methyloxolane (2-MeOx), which has emerged as a promising bio-based alternative. This study evaluates the possibility of replacing hexane, in the extraction of olive pomace (OP), with 2-MeOx, both dry and saturated with water (4.5%), the latter of which is called 2-MeOx 95.5%. The three solvents have been compared in terms of extraction yield and quality, as well as the lipid and polyphenol profiles of the extracts. The work concluded that both dry 2-MeOx and 2-MeOx 95.5% can replace hexane in OP extraction, resulting in higher yields and extracts richer in phenolic compounds. This study should open the road to further semi-industrial scale investigations toward more sustainable production processes. ","Introduction The effect of apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, particularly APOE \u03b54, the main genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer\u2019s disease (LOAD), has been widely explored in neuroimaging studies pertaining to older adults. The goal of this systematic review was to review the literature on the relationship between carriage of the APOE \u03b54 allele and grey matter (GM) changes across various age groups and its influence on neurodegeneration as evidenced by structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).","Background Suicide attempts (SA) frequently occur in patients with mood disorders and schizophrenia, which are both accompanied by activated immune-inflammatory and nitro-oxidative (IO&amp;NS) pathways.","Background Humans take vitamin D supplements to reduce risk of vitamin D deficiency and reduce the risk of osteoporosis. However, it is unclear how dietary super-doses (10,000x greater than requirement) can affect vitamin D status in aged animals. Aged laying hens could be a model to compare with women in peri- or postmenopausal stages of life. The hens\u2019 bone health is physiologically taxed from egg production and they are highly susceptible to osteoporosis.","Cardiovascular calcification is the ectopic deposition of calcium-phosphate crystals within the arterial wall and the aortic valve leaflets. This pathological process leads to increased vascular stiffness, reduced arterial elasticity, and aortic valve stenosis, increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Although cardiovascular calcification is an increasing health care burden, to date no medical therapies have been approved for treating or preventing it. Considering the current lack of therapeutic strategies and the increasing prevalence of cardiovascular calcification, the investigation of some nutraceuticals to prevent this pathological condition has become prevalent in recent years. Recent preclinical and clinical studies evaluated the potential anti-calcific role of nutraceuticals (including magnesium, zinc, iron, vitamin K, and phytate) in the progression of vascular calcification, providing evidence for their dietary supplementation, especially in high-risk populations. The present review summarizes the current knowledge and latest advances for nutraceuticals with the most relevant preclinical and clinical data, including magnesium, zinc, iron, vitamin K, and phytate. Their supplementation might be recommended as a cost-effective strategy to avoid nutritional deficiency and to prevent or treat cardiovascular calcification. However, the optimal dose of nutraceuticals has not been identified and large interventional trials are warranted to support their protective effects on cardiovascular disease. ","Obstructive cholestasis causes hepatic cirrhosis and portal hypertension. The pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the development of liver disease are multiple and linked. We propose grouping these mechanisms according to the three phenotypes mainly expressed in the interstitial space in order to integrate them. Experimental extrahepatic cholestasis is the model most frequently used to study obstructive cholestasis. The early liver interstitial alterations described in these experimental models would produce an ischemia/reperfusion phenotype with oxidative and nitrosative stress. Then, the hyperexpression of a leukocytic phenotype, in which Kupffer cells and neutrophils participate, would induce enzymatic stress. And finally, an angiogenic phenotype, responsible for peribiliary plexus development with sinusoidal arterialization, occurs. In addition, an intense cholangiocyte proliferation, which acquires neuroendocrine abilities, stands out. This histopathological finding is also associated with fibrosis. It is proposed that the sequence of these inflammatory phenotypes, perhaps with a trophic meaning, ultimately produces a benign tumoral biliary process - although it poses severe hepatocytic insufficiency. Moreover, the persistence of this benign tumor disease would induce a higher degree of dedifferentiation and autonomy and, therefore, its malign degeneration. ","Individuals with complex disorders typically have a heritable burden of common variation that can be expressed as a polygenic risk score (PRS). While PRS has some predictive utility, it lacks the molecular specificity to be directly informative for clinical interventions. We therefore sought to develop a framework to quantify an individual\u2019s common variant enrichment in clinically actionable systems responsive to existing drugs. This was achieved with a metric designated the pharmagenic enrichment score (PES), which we demonstrate for individual SNP profiles in a cohort of cases with schizophrenia. A large proportion of these had elevated PES in one or more of eight clinically actionable gene-sets enriched with schizophrenia associated common variation. Notable candidates targeting these pathways included vitamins, insulin modulating agents, and protein kinase inhibitors with putative neuroprotective properties. Interestingly, elevated PES was also observed in individuals with otherwise low common variant burden. The biological saliency of PES profiles were observed directly through their impact on gene expression in a subset of the cohort with matched transcriptomic data, supporting our assertion that this framework can integrate an individual\u2019s common variant risk to inform personalised interventions, including drug repositioning, for complex disorders such as schizophrenia.","Background We explored whether the effects of nilvadipine on cognition were influenced by baseline Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) severity.","Ascorbate (vitamin C) is an essential micronutrient in humans. The chronic severe deficiency of ascorbate, termed scurvy, has long been associated with increased susceptibility to infections. How ascorbate affects the immune system at the cellular and molecular levels remained unclear. Here, from a micronutrient screen, we identified ascorbate as a potent enhancer for antibody response by facilitating the IL-21/STAT3-dependent plasma cell differentiation in mouse and human B cells. The effect of ascorbate is unique, as other antioxidants failed to promote plasma cell differentiation. Ascorbate is critical during early B cell activation by poising the cells to plasma cell lineage without affecting the proximal IL-21/STAT3 signaling and the overall transcriptome. Consistent with its role as a cofactor for epigenetic enzymes, ascorbate potentiates plasma cell differentiation by remodeling the epigenome via TET (Ten Eleven Translocation), the enzymes responsible for DNA demethylation by oxidizing 5-methylcytosines into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). Genome-wide 5hmC profiling identified ascorbate responsive elements (EAR) at the Prdm1 locus, including a distal element with a STAT3 motif overlapped with a CpG that was methylated and modified by TET in the presence of ascorbate. The results suggest that an adequate level of VC is required for antibody response and highlight how micronutrients regulate the activity of epigenetic enzymes to regulate gene expression. Our findings imply that epigenetic enzymes can function as sensors to gauge the availability of metabolites and influence cell fate decisions.","Change in climate of the entire globe due to elevated temperature and minimum annual rainfall in barren zone frequently leads to salinity of soil. The current study was aimed to evaluate the importance of sugar beet extract (SBE) as a bio-stimulant to improve the adverse damages of induced salinity stress (40mM) on growth, oosmolytes and antioxidant defense system of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). Pot experiment was carried in green house under different concentrations of SBE (10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%) pre-soaked seeds of Hordeum vulgare for 5 hours SBE was analyzed for glycine betaine (100mmol/kg), betalains (1.3mg/l), phenolics (1.30g/100ml), flavonoids (0.59mg/ml), carotenoids (0.23ml/100ml), vitamin E (0.002%), vitamin C (8.04g/100ml), sugar (8g/100ml), protein (1.39mg/100ml), and oxalic acid (38mg/100ml) while Ca (13.72mg/l), Mg (7.121 mg/l) and K (11.45mg/l) contents were also determined. We found significant improvement in germination parameters of Hordeum vulgare L. via SB extract on coefficient of velocity of emergence (CVE), mean emergence time (MET), germination energy (GE), timson germination index (TGI), germination rate index (GRI) and time to 50% emergence (E50) under induced salinity stress. However, photosynthetic pigments, e.g., chlorophyll and carotenoids were enhanced using 40% SB extract, soluble sugar, protein, proline, POD, MDA with 50% SB extract while SOD and H2O2 in 20% SBE, respectively. Our findings suggested that SB extract promotes both agronomical and physiological attributes, is a positive way to enhance our economy by increasing crop yields in arid and semi-arid areas along with plant tolerance to under induced salinity stress.","The aim of this paper was to compare the effects of pulp and kernel oils of Canarium odontophyllum Miq. (CO) on lipid profile, lipid peroxidation, and oxidative stress of healthy rabbits. The oils are rich in SFAs and MUFAs (mainly palmitic and oleic acids). The pulp oil is rich in polyphenols. Male New Zealand white (NZW) rabbits were fed for 4 weeks on a normal diet containing pulp (NP) or kernel oil (NK) of CO while corn oil was used as control (NC). Total cholesterol (TC), HDL-C, LDL-c and triglycerides (TG) levels were measured in this paper. Antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidise), thiobarbiturate reactive substances (TBARSs), and plasma total antioxidant status (TAS) were also evaluated. Supplementation of CO pulp oil resulted in favorable changes in blood lipid and lipid peroxidation (increased HDL-C, reduced LDL-C, TG, TBARS levels) with enhancement of SOD, GPx, and plasma TAS levels. Meanwhile, supplementation of kernel oil caused lowering of plasma TC and LDL-C as well as enhancement of SOD and TAS levels. These changes showed that oils of CO could be beneficial in improving lipid profile and antioxidant status as when using part of normal diet. The oils can be used as alternative to present vegetable oil. ","A growing list of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) genetic risk factors is being identified, but the contribution of these genetic mutations to disease remains largely unknown. Accumulating data support a role of lipid dysregulation and excessive ROS in the etiology of AD. Here, we identified cell-specific roles for eight AD risk-associated genes in ROS-induced glial lipid droplet (LD) formation. We demonstrate that ROS-induced glial LD formation requires two ABCA transporters (ABCA1 and ABCA7) in neurons, the APOE receptor (LRP1), endocytic genes (PICALM, CD2AP, and AP2A2) in glia, and retromer genes (VPS26 and VPS35) in both neurons and glia. Moreover, ROS strongly enhances A\u03b242-toxicity in flies and A\u03b242-plaque formation in mice. Finally, an ABCA1-activating peptide restores glial LD formation in the APOE4-associated loss of LD. This study places AD risk factors in a neuron-to-glia lipid transfer pathway with a critical role in protecting neurons from ROS-induced toxicity.","Increasing evidence suggested obesity, measured by body-mass index (BMI), was associated with prostate cancer-specific mortality, and its impact on biochemical recurrence was also inconclusive. We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and bibliographies of retrieved studies up to Jan 5th, 2010. We used random-effects meta-analysis to assess the relative risks (RR) of prostate cancer-specific mortality and biochemical recurrence associated with a 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI. Among the 6 population-based cohort studies in 1,263,483 initially cancer-free men, 6,817 prostate cancer deaths occurred; a 5kg/m2 increase in BMI was associated with 15% (RR 1.15, 95%CI 1.06-1.25, p&lt;0.01) higher risk of dying of prostate cancer. In the 6 post-diagnosis survival studies on 18,203 patients with 932 prostate cancer deaths, a 5kg/m2 increase in BMI was associated with 20% higher prostate cancer-specific mortality (RR 1.20, 95%CI 0.99-1.46, p=0.06). In the 16 studies which followed 26,479 prostate cancer patients after primary treatment, a 5kg/m2 increase in BMI was significantly associated with 21% increased risk of biochemical recurrence (RR 1.21, 95%CI 1.11-1.31 p&lt;0.01). Elevated BMI is associated with risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality in prospective cohort studies and biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer patients. Its association with prostate cancer-specific mortality in diagnosed patients needs to be further evaluated. ","Experimental evolution with Drosophila melanogaster has been used extensively for decades to study aging and longevity. In recent years, the addition of DNA and RNA sequencing to this framework has allowed researchers to leverage the statistical power inherent to experimental evolution study the genetic basis of longevity itself. Here we incorporated metabolomic data into to this framework to generate even deeper insights into the physiological and genetic mechanisms underlying longevity differences in three groups of experimentally evolved D. melanogaster populations with different aging and longevity patterns. Our metabolomic analysis found that aging alters mitochondrial metabolism through increased consumption of NAD+ and increased usage of the TCA cycle. Combining our genomic and metabolomic data produced a list of biologically relevant candidate genes. Among these candidates, we found significant enrichment for genes and pathways associated with neurological development and function, and carbohydrate metabolism. While we do not explicitly find enrichment for aging canonical genes, neurological dysregulation and carbohydrate metabolism are both known to be associated with accelerated aging and reduced longevity. Taken together, our results provide plausible genetic mechanisms for what might be driving longevity differences in this experimental system. More broadly, our findings demonstrate the value of combining multiple types of omic data with experimental evolution when attempting to dissect mechanisms underlying complex and highly polygenic traits like aging.","Osteoarthritis (OA) is characterised by loss of articular cartilage, synovial membrane dysfunction and subchondral sclerosis. Few studies have used a global approach to stratify equine synovial fluid (SF) molecular profiles according to OA severity. SF was collected from 58 metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and metatarsophalangeal joints of racing Thoroughbred horses (Hong Kong Jockey Club; HKJC) and 83 MCP joints of mixed breed horses from an abattoir and equine hospital (biobank). Joints were histologically and macroscopically assessed for OA severity. For proteomic analysis, native SF and SF loaded onto ProteoMiner\u2122 equalisation columns, to deplete high abundant proteins, were analysed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and label-free quantification. Validation of selected differentially expressed proteins was undertaken using clinical SF collected during diagnostic investigations. Native SF metabolites were analysed using 1D 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). 1,834 proteins and 40 metabolites were identified in equine SF. Afamin levels decreased with synovitis severity and four uncharacterised proteins decreased with OA severity. Gelsolin and lipoprotein binding protein decreased with OA severity and apolipoprotein A1 levels increased for mild and moderate OA. Within the biobank, glutamate levels decreased with OA severity and for the HKJC cohort, 2-aminobutyrate, alanine and creatine increased with severity. Proteomic and metabolomic integration was undertaken using linear regression via Lasso penalisation modelling, incorporating 29 variables (R2=0.82) with principal component 2 able to discriminate advanced OA from earlier stages, predominantly driven by H9GZQ9, F6ZR63 and alanine. Combining biobank and HKJC datasets, discriminant analysis of principal components modelling prediction was good for mild OA (90%). This study has stratified equine OA using both metabolomic and proteomic SF profiles and identified a panel of markers of interest which may be applicable to grading OA severity. This is also the first study to undertake computational integration of NMR metabolomic and LC-MS/MS proteomic datasets of any biological system.","Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is characterised by descending skeletal muscle weakness and wasting. FSHD is caused by mis-expression of the transcription factor DUX4, which is linked to oxidative stress, a condition especially detrimental to skeletal muscle with its high metabolic activity and energy demands. Oxidative damage characterises FSHD and recent work suggests metabolic dysfunction and perturbed hypoxia signalling as novel pathomechanisms. However, redox biology of FSHD remains poorly understood, and integrating the complex dynamics of DUX4-induced metabolic changes is lacking.","Yeast Sfh5 is an unusual member of the Sec14-like phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (PITP) family. Whereas PITPs are defined by their abilities to transfer phosphatidylinositol between membranes in vitro, and to stimulate phosphoinositide signaling in vivo, Sfh5 does not exhibit these activities. Rather, Sfh5 is a redox-active penta-coordinate high spin FeIII heme-binding protein with an unusual heme-binding arrangement that involves a co-axial tyrosine/histidine coordination strategy and a complex electronic structure connecting the open shell iron d-orbitals with three aromatic ring systems. That Sfh5 is not a PITP is supported by demonstrations that heme is not a readily exchangeable ligand, and that phosphatidylinositol-exchange activity is resuscitated in heme binding-deficient Sfh5 mutants. The collective data identify Sfh5 as the prototype of a new class of fungal hemoproteins, and emphasize the versatility of the Sec14-fold as scaffold for translating the binding of chemically distinct ligands to the control of diverse sets of cellular activities.","Urine represents a challenging metabolite mixture to decipher. Yet, it contains valuable information on dietary intake patterns as typically investigated using randomized, single-blinded, intervention studies. This research demonstrates how the use of Feature-Based Molecular Networking in combination with public spectral libraries, further expanded with an \u201cIn-house\u201d library of metabolite spectra, improved the non-trivial annotation of metabolites occurring in human urine samples following bilberry and blueberry intake. Following this approach, 65 berry-related and human endogenous metabolites were annotated, increasing the annotation coverage by 72% compared to conventional annotation approaches. Furthermore, the structures of 15 additional metabolites were hypothesized by spectral analysis. Then, by leveraging the MzMine quantitative information, several molecular families of phase II (e.g., glucuronidated phenolics) and phase I (e.g., phenylpropionic acid and hydroxybenzoic acid molecular scaffolds) metabolism were identified by correlation analysis of postprandial kinetics, and the dietary impact of endogenous and exogenous metabolites following bilberry-blueberry intake was estimated.","In the Pune Maternal Nutrition Study, low maternal vitamin B12 and high folate concentrations during pregnancy predicted adiposity and insulin resistance (diabesity) in the children. Based on these findings, we designed an RCT (PRIYA) to provide these nutrients pre-conceptionally to reduce diabesity in the offspring. The interventions included: 1) vitamin B12+multi-micronutrients and protein supplement (B12+MMN), 2) vitamin B12 alone, and 3) placebo. A total of 149 women became pregnant and delivered in the trial. We report results of RNA sequencing in the cord-blood mononuclear cells in 88 deliveries. Gene expression analysis revealed 20 differentially expressed genes (FDR &lt;0.1, a discovery threshold) between the B12+MMN and placebo groups. The enriched biological processes included: chromosome segregation, nuclear division and organelle fission. A cell cycle checkpoint gene Claspin (CLSPN) was expressed less in the B12+MMN group but proliferation markers did not differ. No difference was observed between the B12 alone and placebo groups. The B-complex vitamins are essential for nucleotide synthesis and generation of S-Adenosyl Methionine, a universal cellular methyl donor and thereby may contribute to the regulation of gene expression. Vitamins A and D, and zinc in MMN may also influence gene expression. We propose that the multi-micronutrient intervention influenced rate of progression of specific phases of cell cycle without affecting proliferation. Vitamin B12 alone was not sufficient.","We have described for the first time the potential harmful effects of green tea on the metabolism and body composition of untreated juvenile experimental type 1 diabetic rats. The treatment containing 19.38% of epigallocatechin-3-gallate, its main catechin, increased blood glucose and water intake. It also increased oxygen consumption, enhanced energy expenditure and led to a lipid oxidation tendency in diabetic animals, which worsened the development of body fat in a way significantly more aggravated than diabetes alone. Taken together, our findings indicate that green tea treatment, when provided to juvenile diabetics, increases glycaemia, changes the body composition by reducing fat content and increases oxygen consumption, besides affecting energy expenditure. Therefore, the nutritional status of the juvenile type 1 diabetic rat is aggravated.","\u03b2-Carotene oxidation products have newly discovered bioactivity in plants and animals. Synthetic fully oxidized \u03b2-carotene (OxBC) has application in supporting livestock health, with potential human applications. The safety of synthetic OxBC has been evaluated. An Ames test showed weak-to-moderate mutagenicity in only one cell line at high concentrations. A mouse micronucleus assay established a non-toxic dose of 1800 mg/kg body weight, and no bone marrow micronuclei were induced. Plant sources of \u03b2-carotene inevitably contain varying levels of natural OxBC. Vegetable powders and dried forages can be especially rich. Intakes of natural OxBC for humans and livestock alike have been estimated. The exposure range for humans (1-22 mg/serving) is comparable to the safe intake of \u03b2-carotene (&lt;15 mg/d). In livestock, OxBC in alfalfa can contribute ~550-850 mg/head/d for dairy cattle but in forage-deficient poultry feed much less (~1 ppm). Livestock intake of supplemental synthetic OxBC is comparable to OxBC potentially available from traditional plant sources. Human intake of synthetic OxBC in meat from livestock fed OxBC is similar to a single serving of food made with carrot powder. It is concluded that consumption of synthetic OxBC at levels comparable to natural OxBC is safe for humans and animals.","Background The associations between vegetable intake and metabolic risk factors remain inconsistent. This study was aimed to investigate the association between cooked and raw vegetable intake with serum lipids, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure and glycemic traits.","It is believed that eukaryotes arise from prokaryotes, which means that organelles can form in the latter. Such events, however, had not been observed previously. Here, we report the biogenesis of organelles in the endosymbiotic cyanobacterium TDX16 that escaped from its senescent/necrotic host cell of green alga Haematococcus pluvialis. In brief, organelle biogenesis in TDX16 initiated with cytoplasm compartmentalization, followed by de-compartmentalization, DNA allocation, and re-compartmentalization, as such two composite organelles-the primitive chloroplast and primitive nucleus sequestering minor and major fractions of cellular DNA respectively were formed. Thereafter, the eukaryotic cytoplasmic matrix was built up from the matrix extruded from the primitive nucleus; mitochondria were assembled in and segregated from the primitive chloroplast, whereby the primitive nucleus and primitive chloroplast matured into nucleus and chloroplast respectively; while most mitochondria turned into double-membraned vacuoles after matrix degradation. Results of pigment analyses, 16S rRNA and genome sequencing revealed that TDX16 is a phycocyanin-containing cyanobacterium resembling Chroococcidiopsis thermalis, which had acquired 9,017,401bp DNAs with 10301 genes form its host. Therefore, organelle biogenesis in TDX16 was achieved by hybridizing the acquired eukaryotic DNAs with its own ones and expressing the hybrid genome.","Cytoplasmic lipid droplets are highly dynamic storage organelles; their rapid synthesis, expansion, and degradation, as well as their varied interactions with other organelles allow cells to maintain lipid homeostasis. While the molecular details of lipid droplet dynamics are currently a very active area of investigation, this work has been primarily performed in cultured cells and in vitro systems. By taking advantage of the powerful transgenic and in vivo imaging opportunities afforded by the zebrafish model system, we have built a suite of tools to allow lipid droplets to be studied in real-time from the subcellular to the whole organism level. Fluorescently-tagging the lipid droplet associated proteins, perilipin 2 and perilipin 3, in the endogenous loci, permits visualization of lipid droplets in the intestine, liver, lateral line and adipose tissue. Using these transgenic lines we have found that perilipin 3 is rapidly loaded on intestinal lipid droplets following a high fat meal and then largely replaced by perilipin 2 a few hours later. These powerful new tools will facilitate studies on the role of lipid droplets in different tissues and under different genetic and physiological manipulations.","Given the risk of Candida albicans overgrowth in the gut, novel complementary therapies should be developed to reduce fungal dominancy. This study highlights the antifungal characteristics of a Bacillus subtilis-derived secondary metabolite, surfactin with high potential against C. albicans. Surfactin inhibited the growth of C. albicans following a 1-hour exposure, in addition to reduced adhesion and morphogenesis. Specifically, surfactin did not affect the level of reactive oxygen species but increased the level of reduced glutathione. Surprisingly, ethanol production enhanced following 2 hours of surfactin exposure. Surfactin treatment caused a significant reduction in intracellular iron, manganese and zinc content compared to control cells, whereas the level of copper was not affected. Alongside these physiological properties, surfactin also enhanced fluconazole efficacy. To gain detailed insights into the surfactin-related effects on C. albicans, genome-wide gene transcription analysis was performed. Surfactin treatment resulted in 1390 differentially expressed genes according to total transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq). Of these, 773 and 617 genes with at least a 1.5-fold increase or decrease in transcription, respectively, were selected for detailed investigation. Several genes involved in morphogenesis or related to metabolism (e.g., glycolysis, fermentation, fatty acid biosynthesis) were down-regulated. Moreover, surfactin decreased the expression of ERG1, ERG3, ERG9, ERG10 and ERG11 involved in ergosterol synthesis, whereas genes associated with ribosome biogenesis and iron metabolism and drug transport-related genes were up-regulated. Our data demonstrate that surfactin significantly influences the physiology and gene transcription of C. albicans, and could contribute to the development of a novel innovative complementary therapy.","Background Increased free radical production, decreased antioxidant capacity and excessive inflammation are well-known features in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. Vitamin E is a powerful antioxidant and a scavenger of hydroxyl radicals, and it has been shown to have anti-inflammatory activities in tissues. We investigated the effects of vitamin E on inflammatory activities using an acetic acid (AA)-induced ulcerative colitis model in rats. Methods Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups. Acetic acid was given to 2 groups of animals to induce colitis while the other 2 groups received saline intrarectally. One AA-induced colitis group and 1 control group received vitamin E (30 U/kg/d) intraperitoneally and the pair groups received saline. After 4 days, we evaluated colonic changes biochemically by measuring proinflammatory cytokine levels in tissue homogenates and by histopathologic examination. Results Acetic acid caused colonic mucosal injury, whereas vitamin E administration suppressed these changes in the AA-induced colitis group (p &lt; 0.001). Administration of AA resulted in increased levels of tumour necrosis factor-a, interleukin-1b, interleukin-6, myeloperoxidase and malondialdehyde, and decreased levels of glutathione and superoxide dismutase; vitamin E reversed these effects (all p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion Our study proposes that vitamin E is an effective anti-inflammatory and antioxidant and may be a promising therapeutic option for ulcerative colitis. ","Background Clinical trials are most informative for evidence-based decision-making when they consistently measure and report outcomes of relevance to stakeholders, especially patients, clinicians, and policy makers. However, sometimes terminology used is interpreted differently by different stakeholders, which might lead to confusion during shared decision making. The construct dialysis adequacy is frequently used, suggesting it is an important outcome both for health care professionals as for patients.","Background Anthropometric measurements are quantitative measurements of the human body size, shape, and nutritional status. It is a simple, inexpensive, and non-invasive approach used to identify mothers at risk of labor outcomes. On the other hand, hematological disorders are common during pregnancy with deleterious health effects on the mother and the fetus, which consequently cause fetal growth retardation and low weight.","Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is associated with an acquired hypercoagulopathy and strong predilection for life-threatening thrombotic complications. Current anticoagulant prophylaxis guidelines are based upon controversial hypoalbuminemia thresholds. Anticoagulant prophylaxis is thus inconsistently implemented due to a lack of high-grade safety and efficacy data. Development of evidence-based clinical parameters that define thrombosis risk may thus refine safe and effective anticoagulant use. Endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) is a recognized measure of hypercoagulopathy and established predictor of both incident and recurrent thrombosis. This study utilized biorepository samples from a prospective longitudinal cohort study to demonstrate that ETP is proportional to NS disease activity, resulting in multivariable models that are significantly correlated with ETP. The relationship with disease activity was confirmed in a separate cohort. These models revealed that ETP is related to disease activity in a manner dependent on remission status and that proteinuria and hypercholesterolemia exert the strongest influence on ETP. In contrast to prior epidemiology studies, which did not include hypercoagulopathy measures, we found that hypoalbuminemia was less predictive of ETP. These findings are consistent with our previously reported animal model observations and are expected to inform the design of clinical trials that will generate high-grade evidence to guide more effective and safer anticoagulant use and thus reduce life-threatening thrombotic events in patients with NS.","Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening for prostate cancer remains controversial because it increases overdiagnosis and overtreatment of clinically insignificant tumors. We evaluated the potential of genetic determinants of PSA levels to improve screening utility by accounting for variation in PSA not due to cancer. A multi-ancestry genome-wide meta-analysis of 95,768 men without prostate cancer discovered 128 PSA-associated index variants (P&lt;5\u00d710\u22128), including 82 novel signals. The resulting 128-variant polygenic score for PSA (PGSPSA) explained 7.3-8.8% of PSA variation in external validation cohorts. Adjusting PSA values using PGSPSA enabled more accurate diagnostic decisions, such as avoiding 17-20% of negative prostate biopsies. Genetically adjusted PSA was more predictive of aggressive prostate cancer (odds ratio (OR)=3.04, P=3.3\u00d710\u22127; AUC=0.716) than unadjusted PSA (OR=2.80, P=3.2\u00d710\u22126; AUC=0.684) and improved detection of aggressive disease when combined with a prostate cancer PGS (AUC: 0.732 vs. 0.645, P=3.3\u00d710\u22124). We further showed that PSA-related selection bias distorts genetic associations with prostate cancer and hampers PGS performance. Our findings provide a roadmap towards personalizing cancer biomarkers and screening.","L-DOPA Induced Dyskinesia (LID) is associated with prolonged L-DOPA therapy. Vitamin-D receptor modulation improves motor-cognitive deficit in experimental LID Parkinsonism. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the mechanism underlying the anti-dyskinetic potential of Vitamin D3 (VD3). Dyskinesia was induced by chronic L-DOPA administration in 6-OHDA lesioned male C57BL6 mice. The experimental groups (Dyskinesia, Dyskinesia/VD3, and Dyskinesia/Amantadine) and controls were challenged with L-DOPA to determine the abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) score during 14 days of VD3 (30 mg/kg) or Amantadine (40 mg/kg) treatment. Global behavioral Axial, Limb &amp; Orolingual (ALO) AIMs were scored for 1 min at every 20 mins interval, over a duration of 100 mins on days 1,3,7,11 and 14 of treatment. Thereafter, brain samples were collected and processed for immunoblotting to assess striatal expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), monoamine oxidase (MAO), cathecol-o-methyl transferase (COMT), dopamine decarboxylase (DDC), CD11b, BAX, P47phox, and IL-1\u03b2. VD3 significantly attenuated ALO AIMs only on days 11 &amp; 14, with maximal reduction of 32.7% compared with dyskinetic mice but had no effect on days 1, 3 &amp; 7, while amantadine decreased AIMs all through days 1 to 14 with maximal reduction of 64.5%. TH and MAO-B expression were not significantly different across the groups. DDC was significantly suppressed in dyskinetic mice vs control (p&lt;0.001) but remained unchanged in VD3 mice vs dyskinetic mice. COMT was upregulated in the dyskinetic group vs control (p&lt;0.01) and attenuated in VD3 mice (p&lt;0.05) compared to the dyskinetic group. Interestingly, VD3 inhibited significantly (p&lt;0.01) oxidative stress (p47phox), apoptosis (BAX), inflammation (IL-1\u03b2), and microglial activation (CD11b) in dyskinetic mice. Overall, we find that the anti-dyskinetic effects of VD3 is associated with modulation of striatal oxidative stress, microglial responses, inflammation, and apoptotic signaling.","Human neurodegenerative diseases are devastating illnesses that predominantly affect elderly people. The majority of thediseases are associated with pathogenic oligomers from misfolded proteins, eventually causing the formation of aggregates and theprogressive loss of neurons in the brain and nervous system. Several of these proteinopathies are sporadic and the cause of pathogenesisremains elusive. Heritable forms are associated with genetic defects, suggesting that the affected protein is causally related to diseaseformation and/or progression. The limitations of human genetics, however, make it necessary to use model systems to analyse affectedgenes and pathways in more detail. During the last two decades, research using the genetically amenable fruitfly has established Drosophila melanogaster as a valuable model system in the study of human neurodegeneration. These studies offer reliable models forAlzheimer's, Parkinson's, and motor neuron diseases, as well as models for trinucleotide repeat expansion diseases, including ataxias andHuntington's disease. As a result of these studies, several signalling pathways including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt andtarget of rapamycin (TOR), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling, have been shown to be deregulatedin models of proteinopathies, suggesting that two or more initiating events may trigger disease formation in an age-relatedmanner. Moreover, these studies also demonstrate that the fruitfly can be used to screen chemical compounds for their potential toprevent or ameliorate the disease, which in turn can directly guide clinical research and the development of novel therapeutic strategiesfor the treatment of human neurodegenerative diseases. ","Caveolae have been linked to many biological functions, but their precise roles are unclear. Using quantitative whole cell proteomics of genome-edited cells, we show that the oxidative stress response is the major pathway dysregulated in cells lacking the key caveola structural protein, CAVIN1. CAVIN1 deletion compromised sensitivity to oxidative stress in cultured cells and in animals. Wound-induced accumulation of reactive oxygen species and apoptosis were suppressed in Cavin1-null zebrafish, negatively affecting regeneration. Oxidative stress triggered lipid peroxidation and induced caveolar disassembly. The resulting release of CAVIN1 from caveolae allowed direct interaction between CAVIN1 and NRF2, a key regulator of the antioxidant response, facilitating NRF2 degradation. CAVIN1-null cells with impaired negative regulation of NRF2 showed resistance to lipid peroxidation-induced ferroptosis. Thus, caveolae, via lipid peroxidation and CAVIN1 release, maintain cellular susceptibility to oxidative stress-induced cell death demonstrating a crucial role for this enigmatic organelle in cellular homeostasis and wound response.","Background Selenium forms a significant component of seleno-proteins in the body. Seleno-methionine is integrated into proteins instead of methionine and acts as a storage pool. In proteins, the active form of Selenium is seleno-cysteine.in this review we aim to prevail the results of selenium effect on thyroid status in recent clinical trials. The systemic review aims to find out the correlation between supplementation of Selenium and anti-TPO antibodies and T4 levels in Hashimoto\u2019s Thyroiditis. Selenium supplementation decreases the level of anti-TPO antibodies. The supplementation of Selenium increases the level of T4 levels.","Purpose The Oxford WebQ is a web-based 24-hour dietary assessment method which has been used in UK Biobank and other large prospective studies. The food composition table used to calculate nutrient intakes has recently been replaced with the UK Nutrient Databank, which has food composition data closer in time to when participants completed the questionnaire, and new dietary variables were incorporated. Here we describe the updated version of the Oxford WebQ questionnaire nutrient calculation, and compare nutrient intakes with the previous version used.","BACKGROUND: Soybean oil contains vitamin E and acts as a natural sunscreen which can absorb Ultra Violet (UV) B light and has antioxidant properties to reduce the photooxidative damage that results from UV-induced Reactive Oxygen Species production. The UV blocking from most natural oils is insufficient to obtain a high UV protection. The strategies for preparations of sunscreen products with high SPF can be done by nanoemulsion formulation and Ultra Violet filter combinations of Soybean Oil, Avobenzone and Octyl methoxycinnamate. AIM: The purpose of this study was to prepare and in vitro efficacy evaluation of sunscreen nanoemulsion containing Soybean oil, Avobenzone and Octyl methoxycinnamate. METHODS: The sunscreen nanoemulsions were prepared by the high energy emulsification method. The formulation uses a combination of 3% Avobenzone, 7.5% Octyl methoxycinnamate, with different ratio of Soybean oil and Liquid Paraffin. The nanoemulsion was evaluated for droplet sizes by using particle size analyzer, physical stability in room temperature (25 +- 2degC during experiment for 12 weeks of storage, physical stability (cycling test), phase separation by centrifugation at 3750 rpm for 5 hours, pH, viscosity, and Sun Protection Factor (SPF) value by UV spectrophotometric. The SPF value of sunscreen nanoemulsion was compared to sunscreen nanoemulsion without Soybean Oil and sunscreen emulsion. Particle morphology observation of nanoemulsion by using Transmission Electron Microscope. RESULTS: The sunscreen nanoemulsion formulation containing a combination of 3% Avobenzone, 7.5% Octyl methoxycinnamate with a ratio of 2.73% Soybean Oil and 0.27% Paraffin Oil resulted in the smallest average droplet size of 68.47 nm. The sunscreen nanoemulsion without Soybean Oil had an average droplet size of 384.07 nm. The globules size was increased during the experiment for 12 weeks of storage at room temperature, but there was no phase separation after centrifugation. The formulation of sunscreen emulsion, phase separation was formed after centrifugation. The nanoemulsion had a pH value of 7.23 +- 0.06 and a viscosity value of 133.33 +- 7.22 cP. The sunscreen nanoemulsion containing a combination of 3% Avobenzone, 7.5% Octyl methoxycinnamate 2.73%, Soybean Oil, 2.73% and 0.27% Liquid Paraffin had SPF value (21.57 +- 1.21) higher than sunscreen nanoemulsion without Soybean Oil (16.52 +- 0.98) and sunscreen emulsion (15.10 +- 0.22). The TEM analysis of globules morphology showed that the sunscreen nanoemulsion formed a spherical globule. CONCLUSION: The sunscreen nanoemulsion containing a combination of 3% Avobenzone, 7.5% Octyl Methoxycinnamate, 2.73% Soybean Oil and 0.27% Liquid Paraffin showed synergistic sunscreen efficacy on SPF. This sunscreen nanoemulsion is more stable than sunscreen emulsion formulation during the experiment for 12 weeks at room temperature. ","Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive cancer of the thorax with a median survival of one year. We constructed an \u2018MPM interactome\u2019 with over 300 computationally predicted PPIs and over 1300 known PPIs of 62 literature-curated genes whose activity affects MPM. Known PPIs of the 62 MPM associated genes were derived from BioGRID and HPRD databases. Novel PPIs were predicted by applying the HiPPIP algorithm, which computes features of protein pairs such as cellular localization, molecular function, biological process membership, genomic location of the gene, gene expression in microarray experiments, protein domains and tissue membership, and classifies the pairwise features as interacting or non-interacting based on a random forest model. To our satisfaction, the interactome is significantly enriched with genes differentially expressed in MPM tumors compared with normal pleura, and with other thoracic tumors. The interactome is also significantly enriched with genes whose high expression has been correlated with unfavorable prognosis in lung cancer, and with genes differentially expressed on crocidolite exposure. 28 of the interactors of MPM proteins are targets of 147 FDA-approved drugs. By comparing differential expression profiles induced by drug to profiles induced by MPM, potentially repurposable drugs are identified from this drug list. Development of PPIs of disease-specific set of genes is a powerful approach with high translational impact \u2013 the interactome is a vehicle to piece together an integrated view on how genes associated with MPM through various high throughput studies are functionally linked, leading to clinically translatable results such as clinical trials with repurposed drugs. The PPIs are made available on a webserver, called Wiki-Pi MPM at http://severus.dbmi.pitt.edu/wiki-MPM with advanced search capabilities.","Many fearful expectations are shaped by observation of aversive outcomes to others. Yet, the neurochemistry regulating social learning is unknown. Previous research has shown that during direct (Pavlovian) threat learning, information about personally experienced outcomes is regulated by the release of endogenous opioids, and activity within the amygdala and periaqueductal gray (PAG). Here we report that blockade of this opioidergic circuit enhances social threat learning through observation in humans involving activity within the amygdala, midline thalamus and the PAG. In particular, anticipatory responses to learned threat cues (CS) were associated with temporal dynamics in the PAG, coding the observed aversive outcomes to other (observational US). In addition, pharmacological challenge of the opioid receptor function is classified by distinct brain activity patterns during the expression of conditioned threats. Our results reveal an opioidergic circuit that codes the observed aversive outcomes to others into threat responses and long-term memory in the observer. Though humans often learn about negative outcomes from observing the response of others, the neurochemistry underlying this learning is unknown. Here, authors show that blocking opioid receptors enhances social threat learning and describe the brain regions underlying this effect. ","Codonopsis lanceolata has been used as an herbal medicine for several lung inflammatory diseases, such as asthma, tonsillitis, and pharyngitis. Previously, we showed the neuroprotective effect of steamed and fermented C. lanceolata (SFC) in vitro and in vivo. In the current study, the treatment of HT22 cells with SFC decreased glutamate-induced cell death, suggesting that SFC protected HT22 cells from glutamate-induced cytotoxicity. Based on these, we sought to elucidate the mechanisms of the neuro-protective effect of SFC by measuring the oxidative stress parameters and the expression of Bax and caspase-3 in HT22 cells. SFC reduced contents of ROS, Ca2+ and NO. Moreover, SFC restored contents of glutathione and glutathione reductase as well as inhibited Bax and caspase-3 activity in HT22 cells. These results indicate that steamed and fermented C. lanceolata (SFC) extract protected HT22 cells by anti-oxidative effect and inhibition of the expression of Bax and caspase-3. ","Minerals are inorganic substances present in all body tissues and fluids that directly or indirectly influence the maintenance of multiple metabolic processes and, therefore, are essential for the development of various biological functions. The Lidia bull breed may be considered an athlete, as during a bull fight it displays considerable physical effort of great intensity and short duration in a highly stressful situation. The objective of this study was to assess plasma minerals concentration (macro- and microminerals) in Lidia bulls after intense physical exercise during a bull fight. Plasma Ca, Mg, P, K, Na, Fe, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Se and Mo concentrations were measured in 438 male Lidia bulls. Ca, P and Mg were measured using a Cobas Integra autoanalyzer, while Na and K were determined by ICP-AES, and Fe, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Se and Mo were measured by ICP-MS. All macrominerals, (Ca: 2.96 +- 0.31, Mg: 1.27 +- 0.17, P: 3.78 +- 0.65, K: 7.50 +- 1.58, Na: 150.15 +- 19.59 in mmol/L), and Cr (1.24 +- 0.58), Ni (0.249 +- 1.07), Cu (22.63 +- 4.84) and Zn (24.14 +- 5.59, in mmol/L) showed greater mean values than the reported reference values in the published literature, while Co (0.041 +- 0.07), Se (0.886 +- 0.21) and Mo (0.111 +- 0.08, in mmol/L) values were lower than those reported for other bovine breeds. These increased concentrations could be justified mainly by muscle cell metabolism, hepatic need to provide energy, and intense dehydration and hemoconcentration by losses through sweat glands or urination. ","The objective of this study was to investigate effects of feeding-rearing programs that aim for first calving at 20-27 months (mo) of age on growth, reproduction and production performance of Holstein cows at nulliparous and primiparous stages. We hypothesised that, in a seasonal autumn-calving strategy, heifers born late in the season could catch up to the growth of heifers born earlier and be inseminated during the same period, at a body weight (BW) of at least 370 kg. This approach would result in first calving age at 21-22 mo of age without impairing their later performance. To test this hypothesis, we studied 217 heifers over 3 years. They were split into three treatment groups: control feeding (SD), an intensive-plane diet (ID1) from birth to 6 mo of age or an intensive-plane diet from birth to one year of age. Heifers in groups SD and ID1 were born from September until the end of November, while those in ID2 were born later. The present study showed that late-born heifers (ID2) could catch up with the growth of the others due to the feeding treatment, although they were still 42 kg lighter than the SD and ID1 heifers at first calving. No difference in reproductive performance was observed among groups. Once primiparous, the cows reared with the ID2 treatment tended to produce less milk than SD and ID1 cows (ca. 400 kg less on a 305 d basis throughout lactation), and no differences in milk composition, feed intake, body condition score or BW were observed among groups. Age at first service (AFS) was classified a posteriori into three classes: 12.5 (AFS12.5), 14.0 (AFS14.0) and 15.5 mo (AFS15.5) of age. Heifers in AFS12.5 grew faster than those in AFS14.0 and AFS15.5. Once primiparous, the AFS12.5 cows tended to produce less milk at peak than AFS14.0 and AFS15.5 cows (ca. 1.5 kg/d less) although no difference in total milk yield during lactation was observed. No differences in milk composition, feed intake, body condition score or BW were observed among groups. These results support the conclusion that the feeding treatment can enable late-born heifers to catch up to the growth of heifers born earlier in the season. This strategy results in an earlier first calving that does not impair their reproductive performance but does decrease milk yield slightly during first lactation. Future studies should investigate long-term effects of this strategy.","The environment where an embryo develops can be influenced by components of maternal origin, which can shape offspring phenotypes and therefore maternal fitness. In birds that produce more than one egg per clutch, females differ in the concentration of components they allocate into the yolk along the laying sequence. However, identification of processes that shape female yolk allocation and thus offspring phenotype still remains a major challenge within evolutionary ecology. A way to increase our understanding is by acknowledging that allocation patterns can differ depending on the level of analysis, such as the population versus the among-female (within-population) level. We employed mixed models to analyze at both levels the variation in allocation along the laying sequence of four steroid hormones, three antioxidants, and four groups of fatty acids present in the egg yolks of wild great tits (Parus major). We also quantified repeatabilities for each component to study female consistency. At a population level, the concentrations/proportions of five yolk components varied along the laying sequence, implying that the developmental environment is different for offspring developing in first versus last eggs. Females varied substantially in the mean allocation of components and in their plasticity along the laying sequence. For most components, these two parameters were negatively correlated. Females were also remarkably repeatable in their allocation. Overall, our data emphasize the need to account for female variation in yolk allocation along the laying sequence at multiple levels, as variation at a population level is underpinned by different individual patterns. Our findings also highlight the importance of considering both levels of analysis in future studies investigating the causes and fitness consequences of yolk compounds. Finally, our results on female repeatability confirm that analyzing one egg per nest is a suitable way to address the consequences of yolk resource deposition for the offspring.","The A2 adenosine receptors play an important role, among others, in the regulation of inflammatory process and glucose homeostasis in diabetes and obesity. Thus, the presented project evaluated of influence of the selective antagonist of A2A adenosine receptor \u2013 KD-64 as compared to the known non-selective antagonist \u2013 caffeine on these two particular processes. Two different inflammation models were induced namely local and systemic inflammation. Obesity was induced in mice by high-fat diet and the tested compounds (KD-64 and caffeine) were administrated for 21 days. KD-64 showed anti-inflammatory effect in both tested inflammation models and administered at the same dose as ketoprofen exerted stronger effect than this reference compound. Elevated levels of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 observed in obese control mice were significantly lowered by the administration of KD-64 and were similar to the values observed in control non-obese mice. Interestingly, caffeine increased the levels of these parameters. In contrast to caffeine which had no influence on AlaT activity, KD-64 administration significantly lowered AlaT activity in the obese mice. Although, contrary to caffeine, KD-64 did not reduce diet-induced obesity in mice, it improved glucose tolerance. Thus, the activity of the selective adenosine A2A receptor antagonist was quite different from that of the non-selective.","Background Despite the observed associations between psychiatric disorders and nutrient intake, genetic studies are limited.","Objective To assess the protective effects of lycopene on electrocardiographic, hemodynamic, biochemical and apoptotic changes in isoproterenol induced myocardial infarction. Methods Myocardial infarction was induced in rats by subcutaneous injection of isoproterenol (200 mg/kg) for two consecutive days at an interval of 24 h. Rats were treated with lycopene (10 mg/kg/day, p.o.) for a period of 30 days and isoproterenol (ISO) was injected on the 29th and 30th day. At the end of experiment i.e. on the 31st day electrocardiographic, hemodynamic, biochemical and apoptotic changes were monitored from control and experimental groups. Results ISO injected rats showed a significant alteration in electrocardiograph pattern and hemodynamic changes (i.e. systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure). It also showed significant increase in C-reactive protein, myeloperoxidase, nitrite levels and Caspase-3 protease activity. In addition, it also exhibited alteration in the levels of electrolytes (Na+, K+ and Ca2+), vitamin E, uric acid and serum protein. Gel electrophoresis of ISO injected rats showed increase in DNA fragmentation. Triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining of the heart section shows increase area of infarction in ISO injected rats. Pre-co-treatment with lycopene significantly prevented the ISO induced alteration in ECG, haemodynamic, biochemical and apoptotic changes. Conclusions The present result shows that treatment of lycopene in ISO injected rats significantly attenuates induced myocardial infarction. ","Background A major challenge in neurodegenerative diseases concerns identifying biological disease signatures that track with disease progression or respond to an intervention. Several clinical trials in Huntington disease (HD), an inherited, progressive neurodegenerative disease, are currently ongoing. Therefore, we examined whether peripheral tissues can serve as a source of readily accessible biological signatures at the RNA and protein level in HD patients.","Maize belongs to tropical environment and is extremely sensitive to drought and chilling stress, particularly at early developmental stages. The present study investigated the individual and combine effects of drought (15% PEG-Solution) and chilling stress (15\u00b0C/12\u00b0C) on the morpho-physiological growth, osmolyte accumulation, production and regulations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the activities of antioxidants in two maize hybrids i.e., \u2018XD889\u2019 and \u2018XD319\u2019 and two inbred cultivars i.e., \u2018Yu13\u2019 and \u2018Yu37\u2019. Individual and combined drought and chilling stresses stimulated the production of O2\u25a1, H2O2, OH\u25a1 and enhanced malondialdehyde (MDA) contents which led to reduced photosynthetic pigments and morphological growth. Drought, chilling and drought + chilling stress conditions induced the compatible osmolytes, ROS detoxifying proteins and antioxidants to counterbalanced the oxidative damage. It was found that the concurrent occurrence of drought + chilling stress was more lethal for maize seedling growth than the drought and chilling individual stresses. However, the performance of hybrid maize cultivars (XD889 and XD319) was better than the inbred maize cultivars (Yu13 and Yu37). For improving tolerance to individual and concurrent drought and chilling stress in maize, future research focus should be on developing genetically engineer plants that have the ability to generate specific response against sub-optimal temperature and water deficit conditions.","To address the threat e-cigarettes poses to public health, especially among youths, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a policy in 2020 that regulates the sale and distribution of e-cigarettes with fruit and mint flavors. Such flavors are alleged to lure youth into smoking and can increase the likelihood for addiction to other drugs. However, this regulation does not address packaging that can have a similar effect on the demand for e-cigarettes products. Indeed, certain e-liquids use youth-oriented (kiddish, cartoonish, and colorful) packaging which are attractive to youth but may also induce a no-harm perception among e-liquids users. In this paper, we examine the impact of the youth-oriented packaging on e-liquid sales. Using data scraped from Amazon, the results of our analysis reveal that youth-oriented packaging increases the sale of e-liquids. In addition, the demand for e-liquids is inelastic and the percentage of propylene glycol (PG), the rating, and the sentiment in the online reviews left by previous buyers also influence the sale of e-liquids. This research suggests that besides fruit and mint flavors, the policy goal of reducing use among youth should also include packaging. The analysis finds that taxation policies to raise prices of e-liquids will not affect appreciably the demand for e-liquids. Policies for e-liquids control should focus on designing packaging that reduces the no- or low-risk perception.","Approximately two-thirds of US infants receive infant formula (IF) as a primary or sole nutritional source during the first six months of life. IF is available in a variety of commercial presentations, although from a manufacturing standpoint, they can be categorized in powder-(PIF) or liquid-(LIF) based formulations. Herein, thirty commercial IFs were analyzed in their oxidative and non-oxidative lipidomics profiles. Results show that LIFs have a characteristic lipidomic fingerprint, enriched in an oxidated form of cholesterol, and a lower load of phytosterols. We identified 7-ketocholesterol \u2013 a major end-product of cholesterol oxidation \u2013 as a potential biomarker of IF manufacturing. Our data allowed re-classification of IF based on their metabolomic fingerprint, resulting in three groups assigned with low-to-high oxidative status. Finally, we modeled the dietary intake for cholesterol, sterols, and 7-ketocholesterol in the first year of life. The database provided in this study will be instrumental for scientists interested in infant nutrition, to establish bases for epidemiological studies aimed to find connections between nutrition and diet-associated diseases, such as sitosterolemia.","Pediatric obesity management strategies suffer from a high rate of dropout and persistence of weight excess, despite the use of new tools, such as automated mobile technology (MT). We aimed to compare the efficacy of two 6-month personalized MT protocols in terms of better engagement, adherence to follow-up visits and improved anthropometric and lifestyle parameters. MT contacts consisted of three personalized/not automated What's App(r) self-monitoring or challenge messages per week. Messages, sent by a dedicated coach were inserted between three-monthly in-presence regular visits with (PediaFit 1.2) or without (PediaFit 1.1) monthly free-of charge short recall visits carried out by a specialized pediatric team. The sample included 103 children (mean age 10 years, range 6-14) recruited in the Pediatric Obesity Clinic between January 2017 and February 2019, randomized into Intervention group (IG) (n = 24 PediaFit 1.1; n = 30 PediaFit 1.2) and Control group (CG) (total n = 49). Controls received standard treatment only (indications for healthy nutrition and physical activity, and three months in presence regular visits). Overall, both IGs achieved significantly better results than the CGs for all considered parameters. Comparison of the two IGs at the sixth month in particular showed an IG 1.2 statistically significantly lower drop-out rate (10% vs. 62%, p = 0.00009), along with significantly improved BMI (p = 0.003), Screen Time (p = 0.04) and fruit and vegetables consumption (p = 0.02). The study suggests that the hybrid association of messaging through personalized/not automated MT plus monthly free-of charge recall visits may improve the prefixed outcomes of MT weight loss intervention programs. ","Impaired cognitive functions are well-described in the aging process. GABA(B) antagonists can facilitate learning and memory in young subjects, but these agents have not been well-characterized in aging. Here we show a complete reversal of olfactory discrimination learning deficits in cognitively-impaired aged Fischer 344 rats using the GABA(B) antagonist CGP55845, such that drug treatment restored performance to that on par with young and cognitively-unimpaired aged subjects. There was no evidence that this improved learning was due to enhanced olfactory detection abilities produced by the drug. These results highlight the potential of targeting GABA(B) receptors to ameliorate age-related cognitive deficits and demonstrate the utility of olfactory discrimination learning as a preclinical model for testing novel therapies to improve cognitive functions in aging. ","Background: Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is a rapidly growing global health problem with an estimated 12.6 million cases globally in 2017 and a 112% increase of deaths since 1990 due to aging and population growth. CAVD may develop into aortic stenosis (AS) by progressive narrowing of the aortic valve. AS is underdiagnosed, and if treatment by aortic valve replacement (AVR) is delayed, this leads to poor recovery of cardiac function, absence of symptomatic improvement and marked increase of mortality. Considering the current limitations to define the stage of AS-induced cardiac remodeling, there is need for a novel method to aid in the diagnosis of AS and timing of intervention, which may be found in metabolomics profiling of patients. Methods: Serum samples of nine healthy controls and 10 AS patients before and after AVR were analyzed by untargeted mass spectrometry. Multivariate modeling was performed to determine a metabolic profile of 30 serum metabolites which distinguishes AS patients from controls. Human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (CMECs) were incubated with serum of the AS patients and then stained for ICAM-1 with Western Blot to analyze the effect of AS patient serum on endothelial cell activation. Results: The top 30 metabolic profile strongly distinguishes AS patients from healthy controls and includes 17 metabolites related to nitric oxide metabolism and 12 metabolites related to inflammation, in line with the known pathomechanism for calcific aortic valve disease. Nine metabolites correlate strongly with left ventricular mass, of which three show reversal back to control values after AVR. Western blot analysis of CMECs incubated with AS patient sera shows a significant reduction (14%) in ICAM-1 in AS samples taken after AVR compared to AS patient sera before AVR. Conclusion: Our study defined a top 30 metabolic profile with biological and clinical relevance, which may be used as blood biomarker to identify AS patients in need of cardiac surgery. Future studies are warranted in patients with mild-to-moderate AS to determine if these metabolites reflect disease severity and can be used to identify AS patients in need of cardiac surgery. ","Immunosenescence, oxidative stress, and low vaccine efficacy are important symptoms of aging. The goal of our study was to see if quercetin had anti-aging and stimulating effects on PBMC immune cells in vitro. In the presence of concanavalin a, PBMCs were isolated from healthy elderly and young people and cultured in a complete RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with quercetin. Cell proliferation was assessed using the MTT colorimetric assay after a 48-hour incubation period. Spectrophophotometric assays were used to assess oxidative biomarkers (PC, MDA, and GSH). The ELISA method was used to determine the amount of IL-2 released. A Griess reagent was used to investigate iNOS activity. When compared to young control cells, aged PBMCs had lower proliferation potency, lower IL-2 and NO release, and higher MDA and PC levels. Importantly, quercetin-treated aged PBMCs have a high proliferative response comparable to young cells, restored iNOS activity, and increased levels of GSH antioxidant defences. In comparison to untreated aged PBMCs, treated PBMCs have lower lipo-oxidative damage but higher PC levels. Quercetin may be used as a promising dietary vaccinal adjuvant in the elderly, it has significant effects in reducing immunosenescence hallmarks, as well as mitigating the lipo-oxidative stress in PBMCs cells.","Defective 3\u03b2-hydroxysterol-\u03947 -reductase (DHCR7) in the developmental disorder, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS), results in deficiency in cholesterol and accumulation of its precursor, 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC). Here, we show that loss of DHCR7 causes accumulation of 7-DHC-derived oxysterol metabolites, premature neurogenesis, and perturbation of neuronal localization in developing murine or human cortical neural precursors, both in vitro and in vivo. We found that a major oxysterol, 3\u03b2,5\u03b1-dihydroxycholest-7-en-6-one (DHCEO), mediates these effects by initiating crosstalk between glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and neurotrophin receptor kinase TrkB. Either loss of DHCR7 or direct exposure to DHCEO causes hyperactivation of GR and TrkB and their downstream MEK-ERK-C/EBP signaling pathway in cortical neural precursors. Moreover, direct inhibition of GR activation with an antagonist or inhibition of DHCEO accumulation with antioxidants rescues the premature neurogenesis phenotype caused by the loss of DHCR7. These results suggest that GR could be a new therapeutic target against the neurological defects observed in SLOS.","Background Commercial manufacturers have formulated diets to promote not only weight reduction but also to reduce risks of chronic diseases. The objective of this study is to determine if these formulations satisfy requirements for essential nutrients.","Background Nanoparticles fabricated from the biodegradable and biocompatible polymer, polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA), are the most intensively investigated polymers for drug delivery systems. The objective of this study was to explore fully the development of a PLGA nanoparticle drug delivery system for alternative preparation of a commercial formulation. In our nanoparticle fabrication, our purpose was to compare various preparation parameters. Methods Docetaxel-loaded PLGA nanoparticles were prepared by a single emulsion technique and solvent evaporation. The nanoparticles were characterized by various techniques, including scanning electron microscopy for surface morphology, dynamic light scattering for size and zeta potential, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy for surface chemistry, and high-performance liquid chromatography for in vitro drug release kinetics. To obtain a smaller particle, 0.2% polyvinyl alcohol, 0.03% D-a-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS), 2% Poloxamer 188, a five-minute sonication time, 130 W sonication power, evaporation with magnetic stirring, and centrifugation at 8000 rpm were selected. To increase encapsulation efficiency in the nanoparticles, certain factors were varied, ie, 2-5 minutes of sonication time, 70-130 W sonication power, and 5-25 mg drug loading. Results A five-minute sonication time, 130 W sonication power, and a 10 mg drug loading amount were selected. Under these conditions, the nanoparticles reached over 90% encapsulation efficiency. Release kinetics showed that 20.83%, 40.07%, and 51.5% of the docetaxel was released in 28 days from nanoparticles containing Poloxamer 188, TPGS, or polyvinyl alcohol, respectively. TPGS and Poloxamer 188 had slower release kinetics than polyvinyl alcohol. It was predicted that there was residual drug remaining on the surface from x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Conclusion Our research shows that the choice of surfactant is important for controlled release of docetaxel. ","Background Exercise stress was shown to increase oxidative stress in rats. It lacks reports of increased protection afforded by dietary antioxidant supplements against ROS production during exercise stress. We evaluated the effects of vitamin E supplementation on renal non-enzymatic antioxidants in young rats submitted to exhaustive exercise stress. Methods Wistar rats were divided into three groups: 1) control group; 2) exercise stress group and; 3) exercise stress + Vitamin E group. Rats from the group 3 were treated with gavage administration of 1 mL of Vitamin E (5 mg/kg) for seven consecutive days. Animals from groups 2 and 3 were submitted to a bout of swimming exhaustive exercise stress. Kidney samples were analyzed for Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances to (TBARS) by malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH) and vitamin-E levels. Results The group treated with vitamin E and submitted to exercise stress presented the lowest levels of renal MDA (1: 0.16+0.02 mmmol/mgprot vs. 2: 0.34+0.07 mmmol/mgprot vs. 3: 0.1+0.01 mmmol/mgprot; p &lt; 0.0001), the highest levels of renal GSH (1: 23+4 mmol/gprot vs. 2: 23+2 mmol/gprot vs. 3: 58+9 mmol/gprot; p &lt; 0.0001) and the highest levels of renal vitamin E (1: 24+6 mM/gtissue vs. 2: 28+2 mM/gtissue vs. 3: 43+4 mM/gtissue; p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion Vitamin E supplementation improved non-enzymatic antioxidant activity in young rats submitted to exhaustive exercise stress. ","Objective To investigate the relationship between post-diagnosis physical activity and mortality in patients with selected noncommunicable diseases, including breast cancer, lung cancer, type 2 diabetes (T2D), ischemic heart disease (IHD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), stroke, osteoarthritis, low back pain and major depressive disorders.","Plant metabolites are important for plant breeders to improve nutrition and agronomic performance, yet integrating selection for metabolomic traits is limited by phenotyping expense and limited genetic characterization, especially of uncommon metabolites. As such, developing biologically-based and generalizable genomic selection methods for metabolites that are transferable across plant populations would benefit plant breeding programs. We tested genomic prediction accuracy for more than 600 metabolites measured by GC-MS and LC-MS in oat (Avena sativa L.) seed. Using a discovery germplasm panel, we conducted metabolite GWAS (mGWAS) and selected loci to use in multi-kernel models that encompassed metabolome-wide mGWAS results, or mGWAS from specific metabolite structures or biosynthetic pathways. Metabolite kernels developed from LC-MS metabolites in the discovery panel improved prediction accuracy of LC-MS metabolite traits in the validation panel, consisting of more advanced breeding lines. No approach, however, improved prediction accuracy for GC-MS metabolites. We tested if similar metabolites had consistent model ranks and found that, while different metrics of \u2018similarity\u2019 had different results, using annotation-free methods to group metabolites led to consistent within-group model rankings. Overall, testing biological rationales for developing kernels for genomic prediction across populations, contributes to developing frameworks for plant breeding for metabolite traits.","Despite advances in orthopedic materials, the development of drug-eluting bone and joint implants that can sustain the delivery of the drug and maintain the necessary mechanical strength in order to withstand loading has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that modifying the eccentricity of drug clusters and the percolation threshold in ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) results in maximized drug elution and in the retention of mechanical strength. The optimized UHMWPE eluted antibiotic at a higher concentration for longer than the clinical gold standard antibiotic-eluting bone cement while retaining the mechanical and wear properties of clinically used UHMWPE joint prostheses. Treatment of lapine knees infected with Staphylococcus aureus with the antibiotic-eluting UHMWPE led to complete bacterial eradication and to the absence of detectable systemic effects. We argue that the antibiotic-eluting UHMWPE joint implant is a promising candidate for clinical trials. ","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease marked by progressive loss of muscle function. It is the most common adult-onset form of motor neuron disease, affecting about 16,000 people in the US alone. The average survival is about three years. Only two interventional drugs, the anti-glutamatergic small molecule riluzole and the more recent antioxidant edaravone, have been approved for the treatment of ALS to date. Therapeutic strategies under investigation in clinical trials cover a range of different modalities and targets, and more than 70 different drugs have been tested in the clinic to date. Here, we summarize and classify interventional therapeutic strategies based on their molecular targets and phenotypic effects. We also discuss possible reasons for the failure of clinical trials in ALS and highlight emerging preclinical strategies that could provide a breakthrough in the battle against this relentless disease. ","Background Examining inflammation-related DNA methylation alterations in blood could help elucidate the role of inflammation in lung cancer etiology and aid discovery of factors that are key to lung cancer development and progression. In a nested case-control study, we estimated the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio using a validated index, methylation-derived NLR (mdNLR), and quantified DNA methylation levels at loci previously linked with circulating concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP). We examined associations between these measures and lung cancer risk, and among the cases, lung cancer survival, using pre-diagnostic blood samples of cases (median of 14 years before diagnosis) and controls in the CLUE I/II cohorts. Our analyses controlled for self-reported smoking and methylation-predicted cumulative smoking in order to better focus our examinations on the DNA methylation marks that are informative of the immune response profile.","Background To reduce lung cancer burden in the US, a better understanding of biological mechanisms in early disease development could provide new opportunities for risk stratification.","Background Observational studies have suggested associations between circulating antioxidant levels and many mental disorders, but evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is lacking and causal inferences have not been confirmed. The aim of this study was to explore whether genetically predicted diet-derived circulating antioxidants were causally associated with the risk of major mental disorders using Mendelian randomization (MR).","Mitochondria are a dynamic eukaryotic innovation that play diverse roles in biology and disease. The mitochondrial genome is remarkably conserved in all vertebrates, encoding the same 37 gene set and overall genomic structure ranging from 16,596 base pairs (bp) in the teleost zebrafish (Danio rerio) to 16,569 bp in humans. Mitochondrial disorders are amongst the most prevalent inherited diseases affecting roughly 1 in every 5000 individuals. Currently, few effective treatments exist for those with mitochondrial ailments, representing a major unmet patient need. Mitochondrial dysfunction is also implicated to be a common component of a wide variety of other human illnesses ranging from neurodegenerative disorders like Huntington\u2019s disease and Parkinson\u2019s disease to autoimmune illnesses such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. The electron transport chain (ETC) component of mitochondria is critical for mitochondrial biology and defects can lead to many mitochondrial disease symptoms. Here we present a publicly available collection of genetic mutants created in highly conserved, nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes in Danio rerio. The zebrafish system represents a potentially powerful new opportunity for the study of mitochondrial biology and disease due to the large number of orthologous genes shared with humans and the many advanced features of this model system from genetics to imaging. This collection includes 22 mutant lines in 18 different genes created by locus-specific gene editing to induce frameshift or splice acceptor mutations leading to predicted protein truncation during translation. Also included are 6 lines created by the random insertion of the gene-breaking transposon (GBT) protein trap cassette. All of these targeted mutant alleles truncate conserved domains of genes critical to the proper function of the ETC or genes that have been implicated in human mitochondrial disease. This collection is designed to accelerate the use of zebrafish to study of many different aspects of mitochondrial function with the goal of widening our understanding of their role in biology and human disease.","Microbial interactions shape the structure and function of microbial communities with profound consequences for biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem health. Yet, most interaction mechanisms are studied only in model systems and their prevalence is unknown. To systematically explore the functional and interaction potential of sequenced marine bacteria, we developed a new trait-based approach, and applied it to 473 complete genomes (248 genera), representing a significant fraction of marine microbial communities. We identified genome functional clusters (GFCs) which condense bacterial diversity into groups with potentially common ecology and life history. Most GFCs revealed unique combinations of interaction traits, some widely distributed (e.g., antimicrobial activity), others less common (e.g., production of siderophores and phytohormones, biosynthesis and export of specific B vitamins). Specific GFCs, comprising Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria, are predicted to preferentially interact synergistically and/or antagonistically with bacteria and phytoplankton. Moreover, linked trait clusters (LTCs) identify traits that may have evolved together and point to specific modes of interactions. Our approach translates multidimensional genomic information into an atlas of marine bacteria and their ecosystem functions, relevant for understanding the fundamental rules that govern community assembly and dynamics.","University students are a vulnerable group for poor dietary intake, insufficient physical activity and sedentary behaviour. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of COVID-19 on university students\u2019 dietary intake, physical activity and sedentary behaviour. Participants were students (n=125) from the Universities of Saskatchewan and Regina. An online questionnaire was administered retrospectively (for pre-pandemic) and prospectively (during the pandemic) to examine students\u2019 dietary intake, physical activity and sedentary behaviour. Overall, nutrient and caloric intakes were significantly reduced (p&lt;0.05) during the pandemic, and alcohol intake increased (p=0.03). Before the pandemic, 16% and 54% of the participants were meeting the Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines for Adults (18\u201364 years) of 150 minutes of moderate-vigorous physical activity and 8 hours or less of sedentary activity respectively. Only 10% met the guidelines for physical activity while 30% met the guidelines for sedentary behaviour during the pandemic. The minutes per week spent engaging in moderate to vigorous physical activity during the pandemic decreased by approximately 20% (p&lt;0.001). The hours spent in sedentary activities increased by 3 hours per day (p&lt;0.001). Our findings confirm that during the pandemic, students\u2019 inadequate dietary intake, high alcohol consumption, low physical activity and high sedentary behaviour were significantly compounded.","Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) resides asymptomatically in the nasopharynx but can progress from benign colonizer to lethal pulmonary or systemic pathogen. Both viral infection and aging are risk factors for serious pneumococcal infections. Previous work established a murine model that featured the movement of pneumococcus from the nasopharynx to the lung upon nasopharyngeal inoculation with influenza A virus (IAV) but did not fully recapitulate the severe disease associated with human co-infection. We built upon this model by first establishing pneumococcal nasopharyngeal colonization, then inoculating both the nasopharynx and lungs with IAV. In young (2 months) mice, co-infection triggered bacterial dispersal from the nasopharynx into the lungs, pulmonary inflammation, disease and mortality in a fraction of mice. In old mice (20-22 months), co-infection resulted in earlier and more severe disease. Aging was not associated with greater bacterial burdens but rather with more rapid pulmonary inflammation and damage. Both aging and IAV infection led to inefficient bacterial killing by neutrophils ex vivo. Conversely, aging and pneumococcal colonization also blunted IFN-\u03b1 production and increased pulmonary IAV burden. Thus, in this multistep model, IAV promotes pneumococcal pathogenicity by modifying bacterial behavior in the nasopharynx, diminishing neutrophil function, and enhancing bacterial growth in the lung, while pneumococci increase IAV burden likely by compromising a key antiviral response. Thus, this model provides a means to elucidate factors, such as age and co-infection, that promote the evolution of S. pneumoniae from asymptomatic colonizer to invasive pathogen, as well as to investigate consequences of this transition on antiviral defense.","Objective: Busulfan is one of the most common chemotherapeutic drugs and has the ability to induce apoptosis in testicular germ cells, which leads to infertility. In this study, the effects of ozone therapy and melatonin were evaluated on testicular disorders induced by busulfan. Methods: In this study, we divided 24 male mice into four groups: control group, groups treated with busulfan, busulfan/melatonin, and busulfan/ozone. At the end of a 35-day period, blood samples were taken from the mice and their testosterone levels were measured. Both of the mice's testes were removed and weighed, afterwards, each one of them was used for evaluation of morphology by Johnson's score, as well as for measuring the diameter and thickness of seminiferous tubules. The other testis was homogenized for measuring Malondialdehyde (MDA) and antioxidant status using Catalase (CAT), Super Oxide Dismutase (SOD), and Total Antioxidant Capacity (TAC) levels. Epididymis spermatozoa were also used to evaluate motility, morphology, and sperm count. Results: Busulfan significantly reduced the testis quality (weight, sperm parameters, testosterone, CAT, SOD, and TAC levels) and increased MDA and destruction of seminiferous tubules compared to the control group. Ozone and melatonin treatments significantly increased testis quality, sperm parameters, MDA, and antioxidant status, but they did not affect the TAC level. Conclusions: This study showed that similar to melatonin, ozone can reduce the effect of busulfan toxicity on mice testis. However, further studies are needed to understand the precise mechanism of ozone function on testis. ","The gut microbiota is essential for host health and survival. Here, using samples from animals living in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, we recovered 119,568 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) that were clustered into 19,251 species-level genome bins (SGBs) of which most represent novel species. We present a novel mechanism shaping mammalian gut microbiomes using ancestral founder bacteria (AFB) as a core skeleton and recurring lineage-specific gains of microbial species that are transferred frequently among multiple hosts, not strictly limited by host phylogeny. Such lineage specific gains are responsible for increasing gut microbial diversity, maintaining functional stability, and endowing specific functions for host adaptions. Our analyses did not support the existence of co-phylogeny or co-speciation events between mammal hosts and their individual gut symbionts. The results presented in this study not only reveal novel unique gut microbial species and offer insight of value for understanding the diversity, stability, functionality of the mammalian gut microbiomes, and the co-evolution with their hosts, but also emphasize that animals living in extreme environments are a promising resource for the discovery of novel biological functions.","Crop load management is an important preharvest factor to balance yield, quality, and maturation in peach. However, few studies have addressed how preharvest factors impact metabolism on fruit of equal maturity. An experiment was conducted to understand how carbon competition impacts fruit internal quality and metabolism in \u2018Cresthaven\u2019 peach trees by imposing distinct thinning severities. Fruit quality was evaluated at three developmental stages (S2, S3, S4), while controlling for equal maturity using non-destructive near-infrared spectroscopy. Non-targeted metabolite profiling was used to characterize fruit at each developmental stage from trees that were unthinned (carbon starvation) or thinned (carbon sufficiency). Carbon sufficiency resulted in significantly higher fruit dry matter content and soluble solids concentration at harvest when compared to the carbon starved, underscoring the true impact of carbon manipulation on fruit quality. Significant differences in the fruit metabolome between treatments were observed at S2 when phenotypes were similar, while less differences were observed at S4 when the carbon sufficient fruit exhibited a superior phenotype. This suggests a potential metabolic priming effect on fruit quality when carbon is sufficiently supplied during early fruit growth and development. In particular, elevated levels of catechin may suggest a link between secondary/primary metabolism and fruit quality development.","The recently emerged pathogenic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread rapidly, leading to a global COVID-19 pandemic. Binding of the viral spike protein (SARS-2-S) to cell surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) mediates host cell infection. In the present study, we demonstrate that in addition to ACE2, the S1 subunit of SARS-2-S binds to HDL and that SARS-CoV-2 hijacks the SR-B1-mediated HDL uptake pathway to facilitate its entry. SR-B1 facilitates SARS-CoV-2 entry into permissive cells by augmenting virus attachment. MAb (monoclonal antibody)-mediated blocking of SARS-2-S-HDL binding and SR-B1 antagonists strongly inhibit HDL-enhanced SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, SR-B1 is co-expressed with ACE2 in human pulmonary and extrapulmonary tissues. These findings revealed a novel mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 entry and could provide a new target to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulator that is used to treat ER-positive breast cancer, but that at high doses kills both ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancer cells. We recapitulate this off-target effect in Caenorhabditis elegans, which does not have an ER ortholog. We find that different bacteria dramatically modulate tamoxifen toxicity in C. elegans, with a three-order of magnitude difference between animals fed Escherichia coli, Comamonas aquatica, and Bacillus subtilis. Remarkably, host fatty acid (FA) biosynthesis mitigates tamoxifen toxicity, and different bacteria provide the animal with different FAs, resulting in distinct FA profiles. Surprisingly these bacteria modulate tamoxifen toxicity by different death mechanisms, some of which are modulated by FA supplementation and others by antioxidants. Together, this work reveals a complex interplay between microbiota, FA metabolism and tamoxifen toxicity that may provide a blueprint for similar studies in more complex mammals.","Importance There are gender differences in vulnerability to the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with men experiencing more severe disease at any age. The use of anti-androgen drugs, like 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5ARIs), could protect from severe pulmonary disease.","Background Scientific literature about environmental pressures associated with dietary patterns has been considerably growing over the last decade. However, few studies have analyzed the environmental impacts associated with the consumption of ultra-processed food (UPF) and which steps of the food system that contribute most to environmental pressures. The objective of this study was to investigate, in a representative sample of the adult French population, the environmental pressures of diets according to UPF consumption.\nMethods The study was conducted in 2,121 adults of the French nationally representative survey INCA 3. Food intakes were analyzed to define the %UPF (in weight) in the diet according to NOVA classification. Using detailed environmental data of foods of Agribalyse, we could assess the contribution of UPF to 14 indicators of environmental pressure and details those related to the stage of the food consumed: production, processing, storage, packaging, transport and retailing at the food level. The data was described according to quintiles of % of UPF in the diet and analyzed using crude and energy-adjusted models.\nResults Compared to low consumers of UPF (Q1, median UPF= 7%), high consumers (Q5, median UPF= 35%) had a higher energy intake (+22%) which came along with different environmental pressures (e.g. +15% greenhouse gas emissions (GHGe), +17% land use, -7% water use and +8% cumulative energy demand). Higher pressures could be ascribed to higher energy. However, the processing and packaging stages were significant contributor to energy demand.\nIn Q5, contributions of the UPF category to total pressure were 35%, 39%, 28% and 42% for GHGe, water use land use, and energy demand, respectively, while ranging from 11 to 15% in Q1.\nConclusions Diets rich in UPF, compared to low, were overall associated with intensification in GHGe, land use, and energy demand and with higher contribution of post-farm stages, in particular processing regarding energy demand.","Genetic variation is regarded as a prerequisite for evolution. Theoretical models suggest epigenetic information inherited independently of DNA sequence can also enable evolution. However, whether epigenetic inheritance mediates phenotypic evolution in natural populations is unknown. Here we show that natural epigenetic DNA methylation variation in gene bodies regulates genes expression, and thereby influences the natural variation of complex traits in Arabidopsis thaliana. Notably, the effects of methylation variation on phenotypic diversity and gene expression variance are comparable with those of DNA sequence polymorphism. We also identify methylation epialleles in numerous genes associated with environmental conditions in native habitats, suggesting that intragenic methylation facilitates adaptation to fluctuating environments. Our results demonstrate that methylation variation fundamentally shapes phenotypic diversity in natural populations and provides an epigenetic basis for adaptive Darwinian evolution independent of genetic polymorphism.","","Genetic effects on gene expression and splicing can be modulated by cellular and environmental factors; yet interactions between genotypes, cell type and treatment have not been comprehensively studied together. We used an induced pluripotent stem cell system to study multiple cell types derived from the same individuals and exposed them to a large panel of treatments. Cellular responses involved different genes and pathways for gene expression and splicing processes, and were also highly variable across cell types and treatments. For thousands of genes, we identified variable allelic expression across contexts, and characterized different types of gene-environment interactions. Many of these G\u00d7E genes are associated with complex traits. We characterized promoter functional and evolutionary features that distinguish genes with elevated allelic imbalance mean and variance. More than 47% of the genes with dynamic regulatory interactions were missed by GTEx, but we identified them using a suitable allelic imbalance study design. This indicates the importance of exploring multiple treatments to reveal previously unrecognized regulatory loci that may be important for disease.","Sweet corn is consistently one of the most highly consumed vegetables in the U.S., providing a valuable opportunity to increase nutrient intake through biofortification. Significant variation for carotenoid (provitamin A, lutein, zeaxanthin) and tocochromanol (vitamin E, antioxidants) levels is present in temperate sweet corn germplasm, yet previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of these traits have been limited by low statistical power and mapping resolution. Here, we employed a high-quality transcriptomic dataset collected from fresh sweet corn kernels to conduct transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) and transcriptome prediction studies for 39 carotenoid and tocochromanol traits. In agreement with previous GWAS findings, TWAS detected significant associations for four causal genes, \u03b2-carotene hydroxylase (crtRB1), lycopene epsilon cyclase (lcyE), \u03b3-tocopherol methyltransferase (vte4), and homogentisate geranylgeranyltransferase (hggt1) on a transcriptome-wide level. Pathway-level analysis revealed additional associations for deoxy-xylulose synthase2 (dxs2), diphosphocytidyl methyl erythritol synthase2 (dmes2), cytidine methyl kinase1 (cmk1), and geranylgeranyl hydrogenase1 (ggh1), of which, dmes2, cmk1, and ggh1 have not previously been identified through maize association studies. Evaluation of prediction models incorporating genome-wide markers and transcriptome-wide abundances revealed a trait-dependent benefit to the inclusion of both genomic and transcriptomic data over solely genomic data, but both transcriptome- and genome-wide datasets outperformed a priori candidate gene-targeted prediction models for most traits. Altogether, this study represents an important step towards understanding the role of regulatory variation in the accumulation of vitamins in fresh sweet corn kernels.","Pernicious anemia is a rare condition characterized by vitamin B12 deficiency anemia due to lack of intrinsic factor, often caused by autoimmune gastritis. Patients with pernicious anemia have a higher incidence of other autoimmune disorders, such as type 1 diabetes, vitiligo and autoimmune thyroid issues. Therefore, the disease has a clear autoimmune basis, although the genetic susceptibility factors have thus far remained poorly studied. We conducted a genome-wide association study meta-analysis in 2,166 cases and 659,516 European controls from population-based biobanks and identified genome-wide significant signals in or near the PTPN22 (rs6679677, p=1.91 \u2a2f 10\u221224, OR=1.63), PNPT1 (rs12616502, p=3.14 \u2a2f 10\u22128, OR=1.70), HLA-DQB1 (rs28414666, p=1.40 \u2a2f 10\u221216, OR=1.38), IL2RA (rs2476491, p=1.90 \u2a2f 10\u22128, OR=1.22) and AIRE (rs74203920, p=2.33 \u2a2f 10\u22129, OR=1.83) genes, thus providing the first robust associations between pernicious anemia and genetic risk factors. We further mapped the susceptibility in the HLA region to the HLA-DR15 haplotype. Analysis of associated diagnoses and disease trajectories confirm the association between pernicious anemia and thyroid issues, vitiligo, gastritis, stomach cancer, osteoporosis and other diagnoses.","Maize enriched in provitamin A carotenoids could be key in combatting vitamin A deficiency in human populations relying on maize as a food staple. Consumer studies indicate that orange maize may be regarded as novel and preferred. This study identifies genes of relevance for grain carotenoid concentrations and kernel color, through simultaneous dissection of these traits in 10 families of the U.S. maize nested association mapping population that have yellow to orange grain. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified via joint-linkage analysis, with phenotypic variation explained for individual kernel color QTL ranging from 2.4 to 17.5%. These QTL were cross-analyzed with significant marker-trait associations in a genome-wide association study that utilized \u223c27 million variants. Nine genes were identified: four encoding activities upstream of the core carotenoid pathway, one at the pathway branchpoint, three within the \u03b1- or \u03b2-pathway branches, and one encoding a carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase. Of these, three exhibited significant pleiotropy between kernel color and one or more carotenoid traits. Kernel color exhibited moderate positive correlations with \u03b2-branch and total carotenoids and negligible correlations with \u03b1-branch carotenoids. These findings can be leveraged to simultaneously achieve desirable kernel color phenotypes and increase concentrations of provitamin A and other priority carotenoids.","The diverse cultivars of Brassica oleracea and Brassica napus constitute an important global food source. Of those, the Brassica oleracea convar. acephala cultivar group containing var. sabellica and var. palmifolia and Brassica napus var. pabularia, collectively known as kale, are nutritious leafy greens consumed for their abundance of vitamins and micronutrients. Typified by their curly, serrated or wavy leaves, kale varieties have been primarily defined based on their leaf morphology and geographic origin, despite having complex genetic backgrounds. Kale is a very promising crop for vertical farming due to its high nutritional content. However, systematic analysis of kale growth and molecular composition under different light regimes suitable for vertical farming has been lacking. Hence, we selected nine diverse, publicly available and commercially grown kale cultivars for growth under light emitting diode (LED)-replicated sunlight-like conditions. We then analyzed their growth and nutrition using a combination of phenomics, proteomics and metabolomics. As plant growth and development are driven by the diel molecular activities of plants, we harvested kale leaf tissue at both end-of-day (ED) and end-of-night (EN) time-points for all molecular analyses. Our results reveal that diel metabolome and proteome signatures sub-divide the selected kale cultivars into two distinct groups, defined by their amino acid and sugar content, along with significant proteome differences involving carbon and nitrogen metabolism, mRNA splicing, protein translation and light harvesting. Together, our analysis has generated robust quantitative insights into the diel growth and development landscape of kale, significantly advancing our fundamental understanding of this nutritious leafy green for next-generation breeding and biotechnology.","The microbiome \u2013 the microorganism community that is found on or within an organism\u2019s body \u2013 is increasingly recognized to shape many aspects of its host biology and is a key determinant of health and disease. Microbiomes modulate the capacity of insect disease vectors (mosquitos, tsetse flies, sandflies) to transmit parasites and disease. We investigate the diversity and abundance of microorganisms within the hemolymph (i.e. blood) of Biomphalaria snails, the intermediate host for Schistosoma mansoni, using Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the bacterial 16S V4 rDNA. We sampled hemolymph from 5 snails from 6 different laboratory populations of B. glabrata and one population of B. alexandrina. We observed 279.84 \u00b1 0.79 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) per snail. There were significant differences in microbiome composition at the level of individual snails, snail populations and species. Snail microbiomes were dominated by Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes while water microbiomes from snail tank were dominated by Actinobacteria. We investigated the absolute bacterial load using qPCR: hemolymph samples contained 2,784 \u00b1 339 bacteria per \u03bcL. We speculate that the microbiome may represent a critical, but unexplored intermediary in the snail-schistosome interaction as hemolymph is in very close contact to the parasite at each step of its development.","Introduction Glutathione deficiency and chronic bacterial inflammation exacerbates the oxidative stress damage to airways in cystic fibrosis. Improvements to current antioxidant therapeutic strategies are needed. Dietary supplement, \u03b3-glutamylcysteine (GGC), the immediate precursor to glutathione, rapidly boosts cellular glutathione levels following a single dose in healthy individuals. Efficacy of GGC against Pseudomonas aeruginosa derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a prominent factor in mediating both bacterial virulence and host responses, in CF remains unassessed.","High-fat diet (HFD)-induced leaky gut syndrome combined with low-grade inflammation increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the intestine and may contribute to dysbiosis and metabolic syndrome (MetS). Poorly bioavailable and only partially metabolizable dietary polyphenols, such as proanthocyanidins (PACs), may exert their beneficial effects on metabolic health by scavenging intestinal ROS. To test this hypothesis, we developed and validated a novel, noninvasive, in situ method for visualizing intestinal ROS using orally administered ROS-sensitive indocyanine green (ICG) dye. C57BL/6J mice fed HFD for 10 weeks accumulated high levels of intestinal ROS compared to mice fed low-fat diet (LFD). Oral administration of poorly bioavailable grape polyphenol extract (GPE) and \u03b2-carotene decreased HFD-induced ROS in the gut to levels comparable to LFD-fed mice, while administration of more bioavailable dietary antioxidants (\u03b1- lipoic acid, vitamin C, vitamin E) did not. Forty percent of administered GPE antioxidant activity was measured in feces collected over 24 h, confirming poor bioavailability and persistence in the gut. The bloom of beneficial anaerobic gut bacteria, such as Akkermansia muciniphila, associated with improved metabolic status in rodents and humans may be directly linked to protective antioxidant activity of some dietary components. These findings suggest a possible mechanistic explanation for the beneficial effects of poorly bioavailable polyphenols on metabolic health.","Exposure to plant compounds and analogues of juvenile hormone (JH) increase male mating success in several species of tephritid fruit flies. Most of these species exhibit a lek mating system, characterized by active female choice. Although the pattern of enhanced male mating success is evident, few studies have investigated what benefits, if any, females gain via choice of exposed males in the lek mating system. In the South American fruit fly, Anastrepha fraterculus, females mate preferentially with males that were exposed to volatiles released by guava fruit or treated with methoprene (a JH analogue). Here, we tested the hypothesis that female choice confers direct fitness benefits in terms of fecundity and fertility. We first carried out mate choice experiments presenting females with males treated and non-treated with guava volatiles or, alternatively, treated and non-treated with methoprene. After we confirm female preference for treated males, we compared the fecundity and fertility between females mated with treated males and non-treated ones. We found that A. fraterculus females that mated with males exposed to guava volatiles showed higher fecundity than females mated to non-exposed males. On the other hand, females that mated methoprene-treated males showed no evidence of direct benefits. Our findings represent the first evidence of a direct benefit associated to female preference for males that were exposed to host fruit odors in tephritid fruit flies. Differences between the two treatments are discussed in evolutionary and pest management terms.","Human COQ8A (ADCK3) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Coq8p (collectively COQ8) are UbiB family proteins essential for mitochondrial coenzyme Q (CoQ) biosynthesis. However, the biochemical activity of COQ8 and its direct role in CoQ production remain unclear, in part due to lack of known endogenous regulators of COQ8 function and of effective small molecules for probing its activity in vivo. Here we demonstrate that COQ8 possesses evolutionarily conserved ATPase activity that is activated by binding to membranes containing cardiolipin and by phenolic compounds that resemble CoQ pathway intermediates. We further create an analog-sensitive version of Coq8p and reveal that acute chemical inhibition of its endogenous activity in yeast is sufficient to cause respiratory deficiency concomitant with CoQ depletion. Collectively, this work defines lipid and small molecule modulators of an ancient family of atypical kinase-like proteins and establishes a chemical genetic system for further exploring the mechanistic role of COQ8 in CoQ biosynthesis.","Gut bacterial symbionts can support animal nutrition by facilitating digestion and providing valuable metabolites. While the composition of gut symbiont communities shifts with host development in holometabolous insects, changes in symbiotic roles between immature and adult stages are not well documented, especially in ants. Here, we explored the metabolic capabilities of microbiomes sampled from herbivorous turtle ant (Cephalotes sp.) larvae and adult workers through genomic and metagenomic screenings and targeted in vitro metabolic assays. We reveal that larval guts harbor bacterial symbionts from the Enterobacteriales, Lactobacillales and Rhizobiales orders, with impressive metabolic capabilities, including catabolism of plant and fungal recalcitrant fibers common in turtle ant diets, and energy-generating fermentation. Additionally, several members of the specialized turtle ant adult gut microbiome, sampled downstream of an anatomical barrier that dams large food particles, show a conserved potential to depolymerize many dietary fibers and other carbohydrates. Symbionts from both life stages have the genomic capacity to recycle nitrogen, synthesize amino acids and B-vitamins, and perform several key aspects of sulfur metabolism. We also document, for the first time in ants, an adult-associated Campylobacterales symbiont with an apparent capacity to anaerobically oxidize sulfide, reduce nitrate, and fix carbon dioxide. With help of their gut symbionts, including several bacteria likely acquired from the environment, turtle ant larvae appear as an important component of turtle ant colony digestion and nutrition. In addition, the conserved nature of the digestive, energy-generating, and nutritive capacities among adult-enriched symbionts suggests that nutritional ecology of turtle ant colonies has long been shaped by specialized, behaviorally-transferred gut bacteria with over 46 million years of residency.","Thiol-based redox-regulation is vital to coordinate chloroplast functions depending on illumination. Yet, how the redox-cascades of the thioredoxin and glutathione redox machineries integrate metabolic regulation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification remains largely unresolved. We investigate if maintaining a highly reducing stromal glutathione redox potential (EGSH) via glutathione reductase (GR) is necessary for functional photosynthesis and plant growth.","mTOR inhibition extends lifespan and ameliorates aging-related pathologies including declining immune function in model organisms. The objective of this Phase 2a clinical trial was to determine if low dose mTOR inhibitor therapy enhanced immune function and thereby decreased infection rates in elderly subjects. The results indicate that 6 weeks of treatment with a low dose combination of a catalytic (BEZ235) plus an allosteric (RAD001) mTOR inhibitor (that selectively inhibits TORC1 downstream of mTOR) was safe, significantly decreased the rate of infections reported by elderly subjects for a year following study drug initiation, upregulated antiviral gene expression, and significantly improved influenza vaccination response. Thus selective TORC1 inhibition with a combination of BEZ235 and RAD001 may be efficacious as immunotherapy to reduce infections, a leading cause of death in the elderly.","Background The epidemiological literature reports inconsistent associations between consumption or circulating concentrations of micro-nutrients and breast cancer risk. We investigated associations between genetically determined concentrations of 11 micro-nutrients (beta-carotene, calcium, copper, folate, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, selenium, vitamin B6, vitamin B12 and zinc) and breast cancer risk using Mendelian randomization (MR).","Colorectal cancer is the second most frequently diagnosed cancer worldwide. Conventional diagnostics methods of colorectal cancer, can detect it in advanced stage.","The impact of leisure time or recreational physical activity (RPA) on cancer risk has been extensively studied. However, the association of the occupational physical activity (OPA), which differs in dose and intensity from RPA, with different cancers including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), has received less attention. Here, we present data from a case-control study which was conducted for assessing the risk factors for ESCC. Histopathologically confirmed 703 ESCC cases and 1664 controls, individually matched to the respective cases for age, sex and district of residence were recruited. Information on type, duration and intensity of physical activity was obtained in face-to-face interviews with participants using a structured questionnaire. Conditional logistic regression models were used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). A high level of occupational physical activity was associated with increased ESCC risk (OR = 2.17, 95% CI; 1.41 \u2013 3.32), compared to subjects with moderate occupational physical activity. The association with ESCC risk was stronger in strenuous workers (OR = 3.64, 95% CI; 2.13 \u2013 6.20). The association of strenuous OPA with ESCC risk persisted only in subjects that were involved in strenuous activities for equal to or greater than 5days/week. Our study suggests a possible association of strenuous occupational physical activity with ESCC risk. Although, our results were adjusted for multiple factors including indicators of socioeconomic status, more replicative occupational epidemiological studies are needed to rule out any residual confounding.","Root and root-released organic anions play important roles in uptake of phosphorus (P), an essential macronutrient for food production. Oat, ranking sixth in the world\u2019s cereal production, contains valuable nutritional compounds and can withstand poor soil conditions. The aim of this research was to investigate root transcriptional and metabolic responses of oat grown under P-deficient and P-sufficient conditions. We conducted a hydroponic experiment and measured root morphology, organic anions exudation, and analysed changes in the transcriptome and metabolome, to understand oat root adaptation to P deficiency. We found that oat roots showed enhanced citrate and malate exudation after four weeks of P-deficiency. After 10 days of P-deficiency, we identified 9371 differentially expressed transcripts with a two-fold or greater change (p &lt; 0.05): forty-eight sequences predicted to be involved in organic anion biosynthesis and efflux were consistently up-regulated; twenty-four up-regulated transcripts in oat were also found up-regulated upon P starvation in rice and wheat under similar conditions. Phosphorylated metabolites (i.e. glucose-6-phosphate, myo-inositol-phosphate) reduced dramatically, while citrate and malate, some sugars and amino acids increased slightly in P-deficient oat roots. Our data provide new insights into the root responses to P deficiency and root-released organic anions in oat.","We investigated autosomal mosaic chromosomal alterations (mCAs) in 10,248 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases and 9,298 cancer-free controls of Chinese ancestry. Mosaic loss and copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity were associated with an increased risk of NSCLC, while mosaic gain was associated with a decreased risk of NSCLC, especially those spanning telomeres. The increased cell fraction of mCAs was also correlated with an increasing NSCLC risk in the affected individuals. Both multiplicative and additive interactions were observed between polygenic risk score (PRS) and the presence of mosaic loss, where carriers of mosaic loss events with cell fractions \u22655% among the high genetic risk group had the greatest risk for developing NSCLC. These findings suggest that mCA events may act as a new endogenous indicator for risk of NSCLC and have the potential to be jointly used with PRS to optimize risk stratification of NSCLC.","Vegetable oils (VOs), being our major dietary fat source, play a vital role in nourishment. Different VOs have highly contrasting fatty acid (FA) profiles and hence possess varying levels of health protectiveness. Consumption of a single VO cannot meet the recommended allowances of various FA either from saturated FA (SFA), monounsaturated FA (MUFA), polyunsaturated FA (PUFA), ohm-3 PUFAs, and medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs). Coconut oil (CO), flaxseed oil (FO), olive oil (OO), and sunflower oil (SFO) are among the top listed contrast VOs that are highly appreciated based on their rich contents of SFAs, ohm-3 PUFAs, MUFAs, and ohm-6 PUFA, respectively. Besides being protective against various disease biomarkers, these contrasting VOs are still inappropriate when consumed alone in 100% of daily fat recommendations. This review compiles the available data on blending of such contrasting VOs into single tailored blended oil (BO) with suitable FA composition to meet the recommended levels of SFA, MUFA, PUFA, MCTs, and ohm-3 to ohm-6 PUFA ratios which could ultimately serve as a cost-effective dietary intervention towards the health protectiveness and improvement of the whole population in general. The blending of any two or more VOs from CO, FO, OO, and SFO in the form of binary, ternary, or another type of blending was found to be very conclusive towards balancing FA composition; enhancing physiochemical and stability properties; and promising the therapeutic protectiveness of the resultant BOs. ","We aimed to investigate the link between serum metabolites, gut bacterial community composition, and clinical variables in Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) and healthy control subjects (HC). 139 metabolite features were found to be differentially abundant between the PD and Control groups. No associations were found between metabolite features and within-PD clinical variables. The results suggest alterations in serum metabolite profiles in PD, and the results of correlation analysis between metabolite features and microbiota suggest that several bacterial taxa are associated with altered lipid and energy metabolism in PD.","The COVID-19 virus has infected millions of people and resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. By using the logistic regression model, we identified novel critical factors associated with COVID19 cases, death, and case fatality rates in 154 countries and in the 50 U.S. states. Among numerous factors associated with COVID-19 risk, we found that the unitary state system was counter-intuitively positively associated with increased COVID-19 cases and deaths. Blood type B was a protective factor for COVID-19 risk, while blood type A was a risk factor. The prevalence of HIV, influenza and pneumonia, and chronic lower respiratory diseases was associated with reduced COVID-19 risk. Obesity and the condition of unimproved water sources were associated with increased COVID-19 risk. Other factors included temperature, humidity, social distancing, smoking, and vitamin D intake. Our comprehensive identification of the factors affecting COVID-19 transmission and fatality may provide new insights into the COVID-19 pandemic and advise effective strategies for preventing and migrating COVID-19 spread.","This study examined the effects of Palm vitamin E (PVE) and a-tocopherol (a-TF) supplementations on adrenalin, noradrenalin, xanthine oxidase plus dehydrogenase (XO + XD) activities and gastric lesions in rats exposed to water-immersion restraint stress (WIRS). Sixty male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-250 g) were randomly divided into three equal sized groups. The control group was given a normal diet, while the treated groups received the same diet with oral supplementation of PVE or a-TF at 60 mg/kg body weight. After the treatment period of 28 days, each group was further subdivided into two groups with 10 rats without exposing them to stress and the other 10 rats were subjected to WIRS for 3.5 hours. Blood samples were taken to measure the adrenalin and noradrenalin levels. The rats were then sacrificed following which the stomach was excised and opened along the greater curvature and examined for lesions and XO + XD activities. The rats exposed to WIRS had lesions in their stomach mucosa. Our findings showed that dietary supplementations of PVE and a-TF were able to reduce gastric lesions significantly in comparison to the stressed control group. WIRS increased plasma adrenalin and noradrenalin significantly. PVE and a-TF treatments reduced these parameters significantly compared to the stressed control. Supplementations with either PVE or a-TF reduce the formation of gastric lesions. Their protective effect was related to their abilities to inhibit stress induced elevation of adrenalin and noradrenalin levels as well as through reduction in xanthine oxidase and dehydrogenase activities.","Facing to the important health issue linked to the hypercholesterolemia, which is concerning more than 17% of the French population today, dietary recommendations have to precede or to accompany every medicinal treatment. However, everybody knows that it is often difficult to respect these dietary recommendations which are perceived as a list of forbidden foods. Moreover, they have to be associated to supplementary efforts in order to improve more generally the quality of life (no smoking, physical activity...). In this context, the phytostanols are an original and efficient solution to fight against excessive cholesterol. When incorporated into foods like spread, they can be integrated very easily in a balanced diet. Moreover, the phytostanol present a supplementary benefit when they are consumed in association with a medicinal treatment.","Rumen is a critical organ for supplying nutrients for the growth and production of bovine, which might function differently under grass-fed and grain-fed regimens considering the association of gene expression, DNA methylation, and microRNA expression. The objective of this study was to explore the potential mechanism influencing rumen function of grass-fed and grain-fed animals. Methylated DNA binding domain sequencing (MBD-Seq) and microRNA-Seq were respectively utilized to detect the DNA methylation and microRNA expression in rumen tissue of grass-fed and grain-fed Angus cattle. Integration analysis revealed that the expression of the differentially expressed genes ADAMTS3 and ENPP3 was correlated with the methylation abundance of the corresponding DMRs inside these two genes, and these two genes were reported to be respectively involved in biosynthesis and regulation of glycosyltransferase activity; the differentially expressed microRNA bta-mir-122 was predicted to possibly target the differentially expressed genes OCLN and RBM47, potentially affecting the rumen function; the microRNA bta-mir-655 was exclusively detected in grain-fed group; its targets were involved in the significantly enriched insulin and TGF-beta signaling pathways, which might worked together to regulate the function of rumen, resulting in different characteristics between grass-fed and grain-fed cattle. Collectively, our results provided insights into understanding the mechanisms determining rumen function and unraveled the biological basis underlying the economic traits to improve the productivity of animals.","Background Hospitalized neonates receive the highest number of drugs compared to all other age groups, but consumption rates vary between studies depending on patient characteristics and local practices. There are no large scale international studies on drug use in neonatal units. We aimed to describe drug use in European neonatal units and characterize its associations with geographic region and gestational age (GA).","In January of 2020, COVID-19 became a worldwide pandemic. As many industries shutdown to comply with social distancing measures, the cannabis industry was deemed an essential business in most U.S. jurisdictions. Cannabis is manually farmed, trimmed and packaged. Employees and trimmers in cannabis grows have been reported to test qPCR positive for SARs-CoV-2 and as a result cannabis flower can be a potential inhaled SARs-CoV-2 fomite. Many of the comorbidities described in COVID-19 are also qualifying conditions for medical cannabis access. Bat guano has been identified as a rich source for novel coronavirus discovery and it is also a common fertilizer in the cannabis field. To better assess cannabis fomite risk we developed a SARs-CoV-2 quantitative PCR assay optimized to operate with a hemp flower background matrix. This assay was utilized to estimate the stability of gamma irradiated SARs-CoV-2 as a hemp flower fomite.","Human noroviruses (HuNoVs) are acute viral gastroenteritis pathogens that affect all age groups, yet no approved vaccines and drugs to treat HuNoV infection are available. In this study, with a human intestinal enteroid (HIE) culture system where HuNoVs are able to replicate reproducibly, we screened an antiviral compound library to identify compound(s) showing anti-HuNoV activity. Dasabuvir, which has been developed as an anti-hepatitis C virus agent, was found to inhibit HuNoV infection in HIEs at micromolar concentrations. Dasabuvir also inhibited severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and human A rotavirus (RVA) infection in HIEs. To our knowledge, this is the first study to screen an antiviral compound library for HuNoV using HIEs and we successfully identified dasabuvir as a novel anti-HuNoV inhibitor that warrants further investigation.","Tocochromanols (tocopherols and tocotrienols, collectively vitamin E) are lipid-soluble antioxidants important for both plant fitness and human health. The main dietary sources of vitamin E are seed oils that often accumulate high levels of tocopherol isoforms with lower vitamin E activity. The tocochromanol biosynthetic pathway is conserved across plant species but an integrated view of the genes and mechanisms underlying natural variation of tocochromanol levels in seed of most cereal crops remains limited. To address this issue, we utilized the high mapping resolution of the maize Ames panel of \u223c1,500 inbred lines scored with 12.2 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms to generate metabolomic (mature grain tocochromanols) and transcriptomic (developing grain) data sets for genetic mapping. By combining results from genome- and transcriptome-wide association studies, we identified a total of 13 candidate causal gene loci, including five that had not been previously associated with maize grain tocochromanols: four biosynthetic genes (arodeH2 paralog, dxs1, vte5, and vte7) and a plastid S-adenosyl methionine transporter (samt1). Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping of these 13 gene loci revealed that they are predominantly regulated by cis-eQTL. Through a joint statistical analysis, we implicated cis-acting variants as responsible for co-localized eQTL and GWAS association signals. Our multi-omics approach provided increased statistical power and mapping resolution to enable a detailed characterization of the genetic and regulatory architecture underlying tocochromanol accumulation in maize grain and provided insights for ongoing biofortification efforts to breed and/or engineer vitamin E and antioxidant levels in maize and other cereals.","The recent emergence of a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has led to the global pandemic of the severe disease COVID-19 in humans. While efforts to quickly identify effective antiviral therapies have focused largely on repurposing existing drugs1\u20134, the current standard of care, remdesivir, remains the only authorized antiviral intervention of COVID-19 and provides only modest clinical benefits5. Here we show that water-soluble derivatives of \u03b1-tocopherol have potent antiviral activity and synergize with remdesivir as inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Through an artificial-intelligence-driven in silico screen and in vitro viral inhibition assay, we identified D-\u03b1-tocopherol polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS) as an effective antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 and \u03b2-coronaviruses more broadly that also displays strong synergy with remdesivir. We subsequently determined that TPGS and other water-soluble derivatives of \u03b1-tocopherol inhibit the transcriptional activity of purified SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and identified affinity binding sites for these compounds within a conserved, hydrophobic interface between SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 7 and nonstructural protein 8 that is functionally implicated in the assembly of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp6. In summary, we conclude that solubilizing modifications to \u03b1-tocopherol allow it to interact with the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, making it an effective antiviral molecule alone and even more so in combination with remdesivir. These findings are significant given that many tocopherol derivatives, including TPGS, are considered safe for humans, orally bioavailable, and dramatically enhance the activity of the only approved antiviral for SARS-CoV-2 infection7\u20139.","Background Additional studies on the causal effects of 3-n and 6-n polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) are warranted.","Organisms in the wild can acquire disease- and stress-resistance traits that outstrip the programs endogenous to humans. Finding the molecular basis of such natural resistance characters is a key goal of evolutionary genetics. Standard statistical-genetic methods toward this end can perform poorly in organismal systems that lack high rates of meiotic recombination, like Caenorhabditis worms. Here we discovered unique ER stress resistance in a wild Kenyan C. elegans isolate, which in inter-strain crosses was passed by hermaphrodite mothers to hybrid offspring. We developed an unbiased version of the reciprocal hemizygosity test, RH-seq, to explore the genetics of this parent-of-origin-dependent phenotype. Among top-scoring gene candidates from a partial-coverage RH-seq screen, we focused on the neuronally-expressed, cuticlin-like gene cutl-24 for validation. In gene disruption and controlled crossing experiments, we found that cutl-24 was required in Kenyan hermaphrodite mothers for ER stress tolerance in their inter-strain hybrid offspring; cutl-24 was also a contributor to the trait in purebred backgrounds. These data establish the Kenyan strain allele of cutl-24 as a determinant of a natural stress-resistant state, and they set a precedent for the dissection of natural trait diversity in invertebrate animals without the need for a panel of meiotic recombinants.","Complex I deficiency represents the most frequent pathogenetic cause of human mitochondriopathies. Therapeutic options for these neurodevelopmental life-threating disorders do not exist, partly due to the scarcity of appropriate model systems to study them. Caenorhabditis elegans is a genetically tractable model organism widely used to investigate neuronal pathologies. Here, we generated new C. elegans models for mitochondriopathies and showed that depletion of Complex I subunits recapitulates biochemical, cellular and neurodevelopmental aspects of the human diseases. Two models, nuo-5/NDUFS1- and lpd-5/NDUFS4-depleted animals, were exploited for a suppressor screening that identified lutein for its ability to rescue animals\u2019 neurodevelopmental deficits. We uncovered overexpression of synaptic neuroligins as an evolutionarily conserved consequence of mitochondrial dysfunction, which we found to mediate an early cholinergic defect in C. elegans. We showed lutein exerts its beneficial effects by restoring neuroligin expression independently from its antioxidant activity, thus pointing to a possible novel pathogenetic target for the human disease.","Observational epidemiological studies are prone to confounding, measurement error, and reverse causation, undermining their ability to generate reliable causal estimates of the effect of risk factors to inform cancer prevention and treatment strategies. Mendelian randomization (MR) is an analytical approach that uses genetic variants to proxy potentially modifiable exposures (e.g. environmental factors, biological traits, and druggable pathways) to permit robust causal inference of the effects of these exposures on diseases and their outcomes. MR has seen widespread adoption within population health research in cardio-metabolic disease, but also holds much promise for identifying possible interventions (e.g., dietary, behavioural, or pharmacological) for cancer prevention and treatment. However, some methodological and conceptual challenges in the implementation of MR are particularly pertinent when applying this method to cancer aetiology and prognosis, including reverse causation arising from disease latency and selection bias in studies of cancer progression. These issues must be carefully considered to ensure appropriate design, analysis, and interpretation of such studies.","Background The emergence and spread of Plasmodium falciparum parasites resistant to front-line antimalarial artemisinin-combination therapies (ACT) threatens to erase the considerable gains against the disease of the last decade. We developed a new large-scale phenotypic screening pipeline and used it to carry out the first large-scale forward-genetic phenotype screen in P. falciparum to identify genes that allow parasites to survive febrile temperatures.","The offering of grocery stores is a strong driver of consumer decisions, shaping their diet and long-term health. While processed food has been increasingly associated with unhealthy diet, information on the degree of processing characterising an item in a store is virtually impossible to obtain, limiting the ability of individuals to make informed choices. Here we introduce GroceryDB, a database with over 50,000 food items sold by Walmart, Target, and Wholefoods, unveiling the degree of processing characterizing each food. GroceryDB indicates that 73% of the US food supply is ultra-processed, and on average ultra-processed foods are 52% cheaper than minimally-processed alternatives. We find that the nutritional choices of the consumers, translated as the degree of food processing, strongly depend on the food categories and grocery stores. We show that there is no single nutrient or ingredient \u201cbio-marker\u201d for ultra-processed food, allowing us to quantify the individual contribution of over 1,000 ingredients to ultra-processing. GroceryDB and the associated http://TrueFood.Tech/ website make this information available, aiming to simultaneously empower the consumers to make healthy food choices, and aid policy makers to reform the food supply.","This study aims to systematically review and meta-analyze the nitro-oxidative stress (O&amp;NS)/antioxidant (ANTIOX) ratio in the peripheral blood of people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We searched PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science for articles published from inception until July 31, 2021. Forty-six studies on 3.798 MCI individuals and 6.063 healthy controls were included. The O&amp;NS/ANTIOX ratio was significantly higher in MCI than in controls with a Standardized Mean Difference (SMD)=0.378 (95% CI: 0.250; 0.506). MCI individuals showed increased lipid peroxidation (SMD=0.774, 95%CI: 4.416; 1.132) and O&amp;NS-associated toxicity (SMD=0.621, CI: 0.377; 0.865) and reduced glutathione (GSH) defenses (SMD=0.725, 95%CI: 0.269; 1.182) as compared with controls. MCI was also accompanied by significantly increased homocysteine (SMD=0.320, CI: 0.059; 0.581), but not protein oxidation, and lowered non-vitamin (SMD=0.347, CI: 0.168; 0.527) and vitamin (SMD=0.564, CI: 0.129; 0.999) antioxidant defenses. The results show that MCI is at least in part due to increased neuro-oxidative toxicity and suggest that treatments targeting lipid peroxidation and the GSH system may be used to treat or prevent MCI.","Identifying what therapies constitute complementary, alternative, and/or integrative medicine (CAIM) is complex for a multitude of reasons. An operational definition is dynamic, and changes based on both historical time period and geographical location whereby many jurisdictions may integrate or consider their traditional system(s) of medicine as conventional care. To date, only one operational definition of \"complementary and alternative medicine\" has been proposed, by Cochrane researchers in 2011. This definition is not only over a decade old but also did not use systematic methods to compile the therapies. Furthermore, it did not capture the concept \"integrative medicine\", which is an increasingly popular aspect of the use of complementary therapies in practice. An updated operational definition reflective of CAIM is warranted given the rapidly increasing body of CAIM research literature published each year. Four peer-reviewed or otherwise quality-assessed information resource types were used to inform the development of the operational definition: peer-reviewed articles resulting from searches across seven academic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Scopus and Web of Science); the \"aims and scope\" webpages of peer-reviewed CAIM journals; CAIM entries found in online encyclopedias, and highly-ranked websites identified through searches of CAIM-related terms on HONcode. Screening of eligible resources, and data extraction of CAIM therapies across them, were each conducted independently and in duplicate. CAIM therapies across eligible sources were deduplicated. A total of 101 eligible resources were identified: peer-reviewed articles (n = 19), journal \"aims and scope\" webpages (n = 22), encyclopedia entries (n = 11), and HONcode-searched websites (n = 49). Six hundred four unique CAIM terms were included in this operational definition. This updated operational definition is the first to be informed by systematic methods, and could support the harmonization of CAIM-related research through the provision of a standard of classification, as well as support improved collaboration between different research groups.","In many eukaryotic species the organismal functions of only a small fraction of annotated genes are supported by individual genetic characterization. The organismal functions of a somewhat larger, but still strict minority, of gene models are supported by quantitative genetic analyses (e.g. GWAS). However the organismal functions of the vast majority of gene models are not supported by any direct evidence. Genes characterized by direct investigation exhibit a set of molecular, structural, population genetic, and evolutionary features which distinguish these genes from other gene models. Weaker versions of the same signatures are present among genes identified through conventional quantitative genetics approaches. A new multi-trait multi-SNP association test, the Genome-Phenome Wide Association Study (GPWAS) combines data from large sets of traits and dense resequencing data to identify that set of genes significantly associated with phenotypic variation per se. Genes identified using GPWAS and data for 260 phenotypic traits scored across a maize (Zea mays) exhibit many of the same molecular, structural, population genetic, and evolutionary signals indicative of genes with functions characterized by direct genetic investigation. The strength of these signals is significantly higher for genes identified using GPWAS than genes identified through conventional GWAS. These results were consistent with a large subset of annotated gene models in maize play little or no role in determining organismal phenotypes. GPWAS and future similar analytical approaches that leverage data from multiple correlated and uncorrelated traits across the same population may provide a method to prioritize those genes most involved in regulation phenotypic variation across diverse species.","Head motion is a common problem in clinical as well as empirical (functional) Magnetic Resonance Imaging applications, as it can lead to severe artefacts that reduce image quality. The scanned individuals themselves, however, are often not aware of their head motion. The current study explored whether providing subjects with this information using tactile feedback would reduce their head motion and consequently improve image quality. In a single session that included six runs, 24 participants performed three different cognitive tasks: (1) passive viewing, (2) mental imagery, and (3) speeded responses. These tasks occurred in two different conditions: (a) with a strip of medical tape applied from one side of the MR head-coil, via the participant\u2019s forehead, to the other side, and (b) without the medical tape being applied. Results revealed that application of medical tape to the forehead of subjects to provide tactile feedback significantly reduced both translational as well as rotational head motion. While this effect did not differ between the three cognitive tasks, there was a negative quadratic relationship between head motion with and without feedback. That is, the more head motion a subject produced without feedback, the stronger the motion reduction given the feedback. In conclusion, the here tested method provides a simple and cost-efficient way to reduce subjects\u2019 head motion, and might be especially beneficial when extensive head motion is expected a priori.","Background In this study, we investigated the effect of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) on the morphology of estradiol valerate (EV) induced polycystic ovary (PCO) to find a new treatment modality for improvement of PCO. Methods The rats were divided into four groups. Group1, control; group 2, PCO group; group 3, PCO with HBOT group and group 4, normal ovary with HBOT. PCO was induced by a single intramuscular injection of 4 mg EV in adult cycling rats. Other rats with normal ovaries had oil injection as placebo. HBOT was applied to third and fourth groups for six weeks. Histopathologic evaluation of ovaries of all groups were performed &amp; compared. Results Six weeks of HBOT was resulted in increase in follicular atresia, decrease in the number of primary, secondary, tertiary follicles and decrease in the number of fresh corpus luteum in normal rat ovary. HBOT on polycystic rat ovary, resulted in significant increase in atretic follicles which were already present. Conclusions HBOT of six weeks itself, changed ovarian morphology in favor of atresia both in PCO group and control group. This result of aggravated follicular atresia after HBOT on EV induced PCO may be due to long-term exposure in our protocol which with this state seems to be inapplicable in the improvement of PCO morphology.","Afamin, a human blood plasma glycoprotein, a putative multi-functional transporter of hydrophobic molecules and a marker for metabolic syndrome, poses multiple challenges for crystallographic structure determination, both practically and in analysis of the models. Several hundred crystals were analysed, and unusual variability in cell volume and difficulty solving the structure despite a ~34% sequence identity with non-glycosylated human serum albumin indicated that the molecule exhibits variable and context-sensitive packing, despite greatly simplified glycosylation in insect cell expressed recombinant afamin. Controlled dehydration of the crystals was able to stabilise the orthorhombic crystal form reducing the number of molecules in the asymmetric unit from the monoclinic form and changing the conformational states of the protein. An iterative strategy, using fully automatic experiments available on MASSIF-1, was used to quickly determine the optimal protocol to achieve the phase transition that should be readily applicable to many types of sample. The study also highlights the drawback of using a single crystallographic structure model for computation modelling purposes given that conformational state of the binding sites and electron density in the binding site, likely resulting from PEGs, greatly varies between models. This also holds for the analysis of unspecific low-affinity ligands, where often a variety fragments with similar uncertainty can be modelled, inviting interpretative bias. As a promiscuous transporter, afamin also seems to bind Gadoteridol, a magnetic resonance imaging contrast compound, in at least two sites. One pair of Gadoteridol molecules is located near the human albumin Sudlow-site, and a second Gadoteridol at an intermolecular site in proximity of domain IA. The data from the co-crystals provide an opportunity to evaluate modern metrics of data quality in the context of the information that can be gleaned from data sets that would be abandoned on classical measures.","Microalgae and bacteria have a wide spectrum of associations in aquatic environments. Since their interactions can directly influence global carbon and nutrient cycling, understanding these associations help us evaluate their influence on ecosystem productivity. Algal biodiversity is large, and bacterial associations have been characterised for a small fraction of them. While experiments based on algal-bacterial co-culturing are commonly used to infer interactions, deciphering all associations present in nature through such methods is impractical and approaches based on co-occurrence network analysis can help infer associations. In this study, we used microbial co-occurrence networks built from Earth microbiome project 16S metabarcoding data to detect microalgal-bacterial associations in aquatic environments. We analysed marine and freshwater environments to understand what groups of bacteria are tightly co-occurring with different algal groups in both aquatic environments, to see patterns of interactions, and to evaluate the overall use of co-occurrence networks to infer meaningful algal-bacterial interactions. In line with expectations from co-culturing work, our results show that the phyla Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes are the major bacterial associates of microalgae and the co-occurring bacteria may be specific to the algal host. From the independent analysis of environments, we also show that sample origin may be an important determinant of these interactions. By unravelling previously established microalgal-bacterial links as well as identifying a range of previously unknown interactions, we show that co-occurrence network analysis is a promising hypothesis-generating framework to study microalgal-bacterial interactions that can guide future research into the functional nature of interactions.","Background Wolman disease (WD), the rapidly progressive phenotype of lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) deficiency, presents in neonates with failure to thrive and hepatosplenomegaly, and leads to multi-organ failure and death before 12 months of age. In clinical trials, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with sebelipase alfa led to improved survival, growth and biological parameters in WD patients followed up to 5 years. Long-term follow-up and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) evaluation are lacking. Results We performed a nationwide, retrospective study of sebelipase alfa in WD patients. Five patients with abolished LAL activity and bi-allelic LIPA mutations were included with a median follow-up of 7 years (1-10). ERT was initiated at a median age of 1 month (0-4). Infusion tolerance was excellent on the long-term with only one patient requiring systematic pre-medication. Cholestyramine, fat-soluble vitamin supplements and a specific diet (high in medium-chain triglycerides and low in long-chain fatty acids) were prescribed. Liver function tests, plasma lipid profiles, fat-soluble vitamin levels and growth parameters improved. Three patients transiently exhibited a neuromyopathic phenotype (footdrop gait, waddling walk or muscle fatigue) but electromyography and muscle strength testing were normal. At last follow-up, all patients were alive with normal growth parameters and a satisfactory HRQoL, no patient had special education needs, and one patient required parenteral nutrition since an acute gastroenteritis. Conclusions Early ERT initiation allowed 100% survival with positive outcomes. Very long-term follow-up and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation while on ERT should be evaluated to strengthen the benefits of sebelipase alfa. ","Vitamin A deficiency remains prevalent in parts of Asia, Latin America, and sub-Saharan Africa where maize is a food staple. Extensive natural variation exists for carotenoids in maize grain; to understand its genetic basis, we conducted a joint linkage and genome-wide association study in the U.S. maize nested association mapping panel. Eleven of the 44 detected quantitative trait loci (QTL) were resolved to individual genes. Six of these were correlated expression and effect QTL (ceeQTL), showing strong correlations between RNA-seq expression abundances and QTL allelic effect estimates across six stages of grain development. These six ceeQTL also had the largest percent phenotypic variance explained, and in major part comprised the three to five loci capturing the bulk of genetic variation for each trait. Most of these ceeQTL had strongly correlated QTL allelic effect estimates across multiple traits. These findings provide the most comprehensive genome-level understanding of the genetic and molecular control of carotenoids in any plant system, and a roadmap to accelerate breeding for provitamin A and other priority carotenoid traits in maize grain that should be readily extendable to other cereals.","Protein glycosylation, and in particular N-linked glycans, is a hall mark of Eukaryotic cells and has been well studied in mammalian cells and parasites. However, little research has been conducted to investigate the conservation and variation of protein glycosylation pathways in other eukaryotic organisms. Euglena gracilis is an industrially important microalga, used in the production of biofuels and nutritional supplements. It is evolutionarily highly divergent from green algae and more related to Kinetoplastid pathogens. It was recently shown that E. gracilis possesses the machinery for producing a range of protein glycosylations and make simple N-glycans, but the modified proteins were not identified. This study identifies the glycosylated proteins, including transporters, extra cellular proteases and those involved in cell surface signalling. Notably, many of the most highly expressed and glycosylated proteins are not related to any known sequences and are therefore likely to be involved in important novel functions in Euglena.","Increasing the diagnostic capacity of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 infection) is required to improve case detection, reduce COVID-19 expansion, and boost the world economy. Rapid antigen detection tests are cheaper and easier to implement, but their diagnostic performance has been questioned compared to RT-PCR. Here, we evaluate the performance of the Standard Q COVID-19 antigen test for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection and predicting contagiousness compared to RT-PCR and viral culture, respectively. The antigen test was 100.0% specific but only 40.9% sensitive for diagnosing infection compared to RT-PCR. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 contagiousness is highly unlikely with a negative antigen test since it exhibited a negative predictive value of 99.9% than viral culture. Furthermore, a cycle threshold (Ct) value of 18.1 in RT-PCR was shown to be the one that best predicts contagiousness (AUC 97.6%). Thus, screening people with antigen testing is a good approach to prevent SARS-CoV-2 contagion and allow returning to daily activities.","Myo-inositol oxygenase (MIOX) is the first enzyme in the inositol route to ascorbate (L-ascorbic acid, AsA, vitamin C). We have previously shown that Arabidopsis plants constitutively expressing MIOX have elevated foliar AsA content and displayed enhanced growth rate, biomass accumulation, and increased tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses. In this work, we used a combination of transcriptomics, chromatography, microscopy, and physiological measurements to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms mediating the phenotype of the AtMIOX4 line. Transcritpomic analysis revealed increased expression of genes involved in auxin synthesis, hydrolysis, transport, and metabolism, which are supported by elevated auxin levels both in vitro and in vivo, and confirmed by assays demonstrating their effect on epidermal cell elongation in the AtMIOX4 over-expresser plants. Additionally, we detected up-regulation of transcripts involved in photosynthesis that was validated by increased efficiency of the photosystem II and proton motive force. We also found increased expression of amylase leading to higher intracellular glucose levels. Multiple gene families conferring plants tolerance to cold, water limitation, and heat stresses were found to be elevated in the AtMIOX4 line. Interestingly, the high AsA plants also displayed up-regulation of transcripts and hormones involved in defense including jasmonates, defensin, glucosinolates, and transcription factors that are known to be important for biotic stress tolerance. These results overall indicate that elevated levels of auxin and glucose, and enhanced photosynthetic efficiency in combination with up-regulation of abiotic stresses response genes underly the higher growth rate and abiotic stresses tolerance phenotype of the AtMIOX4 over-expressers.","The uptake and digestion of host hemoglobin by malaria parasites during blood stage growth leads to significant oxidative damage of membrane lipids. Repair of lipid peroxidation damage is crucial for parasite survival. Here, we demonstrate that Plasmodium falciparum imports a host antioxidant enzyme, peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6), during hemoglobin uptake from the red blood cell cytosol. PRDX6 is a lipid peroxidation repair enzyme with phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity. Inhibition of PRDX6 with a PLA2 inhibitor, Darapladib, increases lipid peroxidation damage in the parasite and disrupts transport of hemoglobin-containing vesicles to the food vacuole, causing parasite death. Furthermore, inhibition of PRDX6 synergistically reduces the survival of artemisinin-resistant parasites following co-treatment of parasite cultures with artemisinin and Darapladib. Thus, PRDX6 is a unique host-derived drug target for development of antimalarial drugs that could help overcome artemisinin resistance.","Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a growing cause of chronic liver disease. Using a proxy NAFLD definition of chronic alanine aminotransferase elevation (cALT) without other liver diseases, we performed a trans-ancestry genome-wide association study in the Million Veteran Program including 90,408 cALT cases and 128,187 controls. In the Discovery stage, seventy-seven loci exceeded genome-wide significance \u2013 including 25 without prior NAFLD or ALT associations \u2013 with one additional locus identified in European-American-only and two in African-American-only analyses (P&lt;5\u00d710-8). External replication in cohorts with NAFLD defined by histology (7,397 cases, 56,785 controls) or liver fat extracted from radiologic imaging (n=44,289) validated 17 SNPs (P&lt;6.5\u00d710-4) of which 9 were novel (TRIB1, PPARG, MTTP, SERPINA1, FTO, IL1RN, COBLL1, APOH, and IFI30). Pleiotropy analysis showed that 61 of 77 trans-ancestry and all 17 validated SNPs were jointly associated with metabolic and/or inflammatory traits, revealing a complex model of genetic architecture. Our approach integrating cALT, histology and imaging reveals new insights into genetic liability to NAFLD.","In the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT), selenium supplementation (causing a median 114 \u03bcg/L increase in circulating selenium) did not lower overall prostate cancer risk, but increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer and type 2 diabetes. Mendelian randomization analysis uses genetic variants to proxy modifiable risk factors and can strengthen causal inference in observational studies. We constructed a genetic risk score comprising eleven single-nucleotide polymorphisms robustly (P&lt;5x10\u22128) associated with circulating selenium in genome-wide association studies. In a Mendelian randomization analysis of 72,729 men in the PRACTICAL Consortium (44,825 cases, 27,904 controls), 114 \u03bcg/L higher genetically-elevated circulating selenium was not associated with prostate cancer (OR: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.89-1.13). Concordant with findings from SELECT, selenium was weakly associated with advanced (including high-grade) prostate cancer (OR: 1.21; 95% CI: 0.98-1.49) and type 2 diabetes (OR: 1.18; 95% CI: 0.97-1.43; in a type 2 diabetes GWAS meta-analysis with up to 49,266 cases, 249,906 controls). Mendelian randomization mirrored the outcome of selenium supplementation in SELECT and may offer an approach for the prioritization of interventions for follow-up in large-scale randomized controlled trials.","We previously demonstrated that maize (Zea mays) locus very oil yellow1 (vey1) encodes a putative cis-regulatory expression polymorphism at the magnesium chelatase subunit I gene (aka oil yellow1) that strongly modifies the chlorophyll content of the semi-dominant Oy1-N1989 mutants. The vey1 allele of Mo17 inbred line reduces chlorophyll content in the mutants leading to reduced photosynthetic output. Oy1-N1989 mutants in B73 reached reproductive maturity four days later than wild-type siblings. Enhancement of Oy1-N1989 by the Mo17 allele at the vey1 QTL delayed maturity further, resulting in detection of a flowering time QTL in two bi-parental mapping populations crossed to Oy1-N1989. The near isogenic lines of B73 harboring the vey1 allele from Mo17 delayed flowering of Oy1-N1989 mutants by twelve days. Just as previously observed for chlorophyll content, vey1 had no effect on reproductive maturity in the absence of the Oy1-N1989 allele. Loss of chlorophyll biosynthesis in Oy1-N1989 mutants and enhancement by vey1 reduced CO2 assimilation. We attempted to separate the effects of photosynthesis on the induction of flowering from a possible impact of chlorophyll metabolites and retrograde signaling by manually reducing leaf area. Removal of leaves, independent of the Oy1-N1989 mutant, delayed flowering but surprisingly reduced chlorophyll contents of emerging leaves. Thus, defoliation did not completely separate the identity of the signal(s) that regulates flowering time from changes in chlorophyll content in the foliage. These findings illustrate the necessity to explore the linkage between metabolism and the mechanisms that connect it to flowering time regulation.","The orthodontic miniscrew (TADs) is a device that is fixed into bone in the short term for the purpose of enhancing orthodontic anchorage. The aim of our study was to investigate the structural and surface properties of recovered TADs after orthodontic treatment, and compare them to new TADs. TADs (n = 15) from the same manufacturer (Absoanchor; Dentos, Daegu, Korea) were assessed; n = 10 were recovered from patients after orthodontic treatment and n = 5 were new. We performed electrochemical investigations, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and microbiological analysis. Qualitative analysis on general electrochemical polarization revealed that the TADs retrieved from the patients provided much lower current densities in the passivity zone, and the oxidative processes taking place on their surface were of lower intensity. The surface morphologies of the tips of the retrieved mini-implants showed less sharp tips and smooth surfaces. Defects in the form of pores or cracks could be identified in both evaluated TAD groups. All retrieved TADs showed signs of biological materials (SEM analysis) and contamination on their surfaces. In conclusion, these results can assist orthodontists in comprehending the complexities of TAD behavior with respect to their design and structure. ","Understanding the operational molecular, and metabolic networks that determine the balance between pro- and anti-ferroptotic regulatory pathways could unravel unique vulnerabilities to be exploited for cancer therapy. Here we identify the selenoprotein P (SELENOP) receptor, LRP8, as a key determinant protecting MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells from ferroptosis in vitro and in orthotopic neuroblastoma mouse models. Specifically, the exquisite dependency on LRP8-mediated selenocysteine import is caused by the failure of MYCN-amplified cells to efficiently utilize alternative forms of selenium/selenocysteine based uptake necessary for selenoprotein biosynthesis. Increased activity of one of such transporters, SLC7A11, in MYCN-amplified cells leads to cysteine overload, progressive mitochondrial decline and impaired proliferation. These data reveal in LRP8 a targetable, and specific vulnerability of MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells and disclose a yet-unaccounted mechanism for selective ferroptosis induction that has the potential to become an important therapeutic entry point for MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma.","Antizyme inhibitor 1 (AZIN1) is a critical target in prostate cancer, which regulates the adenosine-to-inosine (A to I) RNA editing during the cancer progression. However, the potential signaling pathways and functions remain unknown. Here, our objective is to figure out the functional molecules and signaling pathways by analyzing the RNA-seq data. The GSE189379 was produced by the Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens). The KEGG and GO analyses showed that focal adhesion and proteoglycans are the mainly affected processes in prostate cancer with the loss of AZIN1. Moreover, we identified ten key molecules including FN1, HRAS, CCND1, RAD51, PCNA, TYMS, CASP3, RRM2, BIRC5, and CCNE2. Therefore, this study provides novel knowledge of AZIN1 mediated prostate cancer.","La maladie de La Peyronie est caracterisee par la survenue d'une ou plusieurs plaques fibro-inflammatoires au niveau de l'albuginee des corps caverneux. Ce processus est responsable a des degres divers de douleurs, de courbure en erection ainsi que dans les formes evoluees d'insuffisance erectile. De tres nombreux traitements medicaux ont ete proposes pendant la phase active de la maladie. Cependant la comparaison de l'efficacite des differents traitements ne met pas en evidence de difference significative. L'amelioration sur la douleur lors des rapports est observee dans la majorite des cas; la reducation de la courbure ou de la taille de la plaque chez seulement un tiers des patients. Le traitement ideal sera donc le moins contraignant et le plus denue d'effets secondaires. Parmi les traitements oraux, la vitaminotherapie E est celui qui repond le mieux a ces criteres. La radiotherapie localisee doit etre reservee aux formes tres douloureuses resistant aux antalgiques habituels. Une irradiation localisee respectant les doses recommandees ne donne pas de complications. Parmi les nouveaux traitements medicaux de la maladie de La Peyronie, l'injection locale d'Orgoteine semble donner les meilleurs resultats. Ce traitement permettrait d'obtenir une efficacite plus rapide que celle du traitement par vitamine E, en particulier en cas d'association au traitement physique par ionophorese. Cependant, la confirmation de ces resultats necessite que soit realisees des etudes prospectives randomisees versus placebo.","Satellite glia are the major glial type found in ganglia of the peripheral nervous system and wrap around cell bodies of sympathetic and sensory neurons that are very diverse. Other than their close physical association with peripheral neurons, little is known about this glial population. Here, we performed single cell RNA sequencing analysis and identified five different populations of satellite glia from sympathetic and sensory ganglia. We identified three shared populations of satellite glia enriched in immune-response genes, immediate-early genes and ion channels/ECM-interactors, respectively. Sensory- and sympathetic-specific satellite glia are differentially enriched for modulators of lipid synthesis and metabolism. Sensory glia are also specifically enriched for genes involved in glutamate turnover. Further, satellite glia and Schwann cells can be distinguished by unique transcriptional signatures. This study reveals remarkable heterogeneity of satellite glia in the peripheral nervous system.","Mitochondrial diseases affect 1 in 5,000 live births around the world. They are caused by inherited or de novo mutations in over 350 nuclear-encoded and mtDNA-encoded genes. There is no approved treatment to stop the progression of any mitochondrial disease despite the enormous global unmet need. Affected families often self-compound cocktails of over-the-counter vitamins and generally recognized as safe nutritional supplements that have not received regulatory approval for efficacy. Finding a new use for an approved drug is called repurposing, an attractive path for mitochondrial diseases because of the reduced safety risks, low costs and fast timelines to a clinic-ready therapy or combination of therapies. Here I describe the first-ever drug repurposing screen for mitochondrial diseases involving complex I deficiency, e.g., Leigh syndrome, using the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica as a model system. Unlike the more commonly used yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae but like humans, Yarrowia lipolytica has a functional and metabolically integrated respiratory complex I and is an obligate aerobe. In 384-well-plate liquid culture format without shaking, Yarrowia lipolytica cells grown in either glucose-containing media or acetate-containing media were treated with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (3\u00b5M and 6\u03bcM, respectively) of the natural product and complex I inhibitor piericidin A. Out of 2,560 compounds in the Microsource Spectrum collection, 24 suppressors of piercidin A reached statistical significance in one or both media conditions. The suppressors include calcium channel blockers nisoldipine, amiodarone and tetrandrine as well as the farnesol-like sesquiterpenoids parthenolide, nerolidol and bisabolol, which may all be modulating mitochondrial calcium homeostasis. Estradiols and synthetic estrogen receptor agonists are the largest class of suppressors that rescue growth of piericidin-A-treated Yarrowia lipolytica cells in both glucose-containing and acetate-containing media. Analysis of structure-activity relationships suggests that estrogens may enhance bioenergetics by evolutionarily conserved interactions with mitochondrial membranes that promote mitochondrial filamentation and mitochondrial DNA replication.","","The identification of multiple genetic risk factors for Alzheimer Disease (AD) provides evidence to support that many pathways contribute to AD onset and progression. However, the metabolomic and lipidomic profiles in carriers of distinct genetic risk factors are not fully understood. The metabolome can provide a direct image of dysregulated pathways in the brain, including information on treatment targets. In this study, we interrogate the metabolomic and lipidomic signatures in the AD brain, including carriers of pathogenic variants in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 (autosomal dominant AD; ADAD), APOE \u03b54 and TREM2 risk variant carriers, and non-carrier sporadic AD (sAD). We generated metabolomic and lipidomic data from parietal cortical tissue from 366 participants with AD pathology and 26 cognitively unimpaired controls using the Metabolon global metabolomics platform. We identified 133 metabolites associated with disease status (FDR q-value&lt;0.05). In sAD brains these include tryptophan betaine (b=-0.57) and N-acetylputrescine (b=-0.14). Metabolites associated with sAD and ADAD include ergothioneine (b=-0.21 and -0.26 respectively) and serotonin (b=-0.34 and -0.58, respectively). TREM2 and ADAD showed association with \u03b1-tocopherol (b=-0.12 and -0.12) and CDP-ethanolamine (b=-0.13 and -0.10). \u03b2-citrylglutamate levels are associated with sAD, ADAD, and TREM2 compared to controls (b=-0.15; -0.22; and -0.29, respectively). Additionally, we identified a signature of 16 metabolites that is significantly altered between genetic groups (sAD vs. control p = 1.05\u00d710-7, ADAD vs. sAD p = 3.21\u00d710-5) and is associated with Braak tau stage and disease duration. These data are available to the scientific community through a public web browser (http://ngi.pub/Metabolomics). Our findings were replicated in an independent cohort of 327 individuals.","We describe the rationale, design, and implementation of baseline enrollment for a longitudinal, observational cohort study of healthcare workers. The importance of workplace as a characteristic of interest in population-based studies has become increasingly apparent over time. Most adults spend a majority of their waking hours living in their workplace environment, which serves as a source of unique as well as shared exposures, stressors, and related determinants of health. A rapidly expanding segment of the working population includes those individuals who work in the fields of healthcare. The healthcare workforce, at large, represents an increasingly diverse subset of the population with broad exposures; some exposures are specific to the workplace and others are common to persons living in the community. Importantly, healthcare workers tend to have general interest and willingness to participate in research, in addition to stable employment and easy access to on-site clinical research assessment locations. Accordingly, from a population of individuals working at a large medical delivery network, we enrolled over 6300 healthcare workers into a cohort study involving survey data collection on medical history, work environment, and family and living situation; this information was linked to participant electronic health record data and collected biospecimens.","Mediator of Cell Motility 1 (MEMO1) is an ubiquitously expressed modulator of cellular responses to growth factors including FGF23 signaling, and Memo1-deficient mice share some phenotypic traits with Fgf23- or Klotho-deficient mouse models. Here, we tested whether Memo1 gene expression is regulated by calciotropic hormones or by changing the dietary mineral load.","Animal studies suggest that chronic monosodium glutamate (MSG) intake induces kidney damage by oxidative stress. However, the underlying mechanisms are still unclear, despite the growing evidence and consensus that a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, glutamate receptors and cystine-glutamate antiporter play an important role in up-regulation of oxidative stress in MSG-induced renal toxicity. This review summaries evidence from studies into MSG-induced renal oxidative damage, possible mechanisms and their importance from a toxicological viewpoint. ","Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is recognized as a major pathogenic event in a number of human diseases, and mitochondrial scavenging of ROS appears a promising therapeutic approach. Recently, two mitochondrial antioxidants have been developed; conjugating a-tocopherol and the ubiquinol moiety of coenzyme Q to the lipophilic triphenylphosphonium cation (TPP+), denominated MitoE2 and MitoQ10, respectively. We have investigated the effect of these compounds on mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis, which controls processes as diverse as activation of mitochondrial dehydrogenases and pro-apoptotic morphological changes of the organelle. We demonstrate that treatment of HeLa cells with both MitoE2 and MitoQ10 induces (albeit with different efficacy) a major enhancement of the increase in matrix Ca2+ concentration triggered by cell stimulation with the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-generating agonist histamine. The effect is a result of the inhibition of Ca2+ efflux from the organelle and depends on the TPP+ moiety of these compounds. Overall, the data identify an effect independent of their antioxidant activity, that on the one hand may be useful in addressing disorders in which mitochondrial Ca2+ handling is impaired (e.g., mitochondrial diseases) and on the other may favor mitochondrial Ca2+ overload and thus increase cell sensitivity to apoptosis (thus possibly counteracting the benefits of the antioxidant activity). ","Herbal products are increasingly used, mainly in chronic liver disease. Extracts of milk thistle, Silymarin and silybin, are the most prescribed natural compounds, with different indications, but with no definitive results in terms of clinical efficacy. This review analyzes the available studies on the effects of the purified product silybin, both as a free and a conjugated molecule, on liver cells or on experimentally induced liver damage, and in patients with liver disease. We searched PUBMED for articles pertaining to the in vitro and in vivo effects of silybin, its antifibrotic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties, as well as its metabolic effects, combined with the authors' own knowledge of the literature. Results indicate that the bioavailability of silybin phytosome is higher than that of silymarin and is less influenced by liver damage; silybin does not show significant interactions with other drugs and at doses &lt; 10 g/d has no significant side effects. Experimental studies have clearly demonstrated the antifibrotic, antioxidant and metabolic effects of silybin; previous human studies were insufficient for confirming the clinical efficacy in chronic liver disease, while ongoing clinical trials are promising. On the basis of literature data, silybin seems a promising drug for chronic liver disease. ","Cancer cells develop tactics to circumvent the interventions by desensitizing themselves to interventions. The principle route of desensitization includes activation of survival pathways (e.g. NF-kB, PARP) and downregulation of cell death pathways (e.g. CD95, ASK1). As a result, it requires high dose of therapy to induce cell death which, in turn damages normal cells through the collateral effects. Methods are needed to sensitize the low and non-responsive resistant tumor cells in order to evoke a better response from the current treatments. Current treatments including chemotherapy can induce cell death only in bulk cancer cells sparing low-responsive and resistant tumor cells. Here we report a novel tumor sensitizer derived from the natural Vitamin E analogue (AMP-001). The drug design is based on a novel \u201cA priori activation of apoptosis pathways of tumor technology (AAAPT) which is designed to activate cell death pathways and inhibit survival pathways simultaneously. It involves an inbuilt targeting vector which targets tumor specific Cathepsin B, overexpressed by many cancers including gastric cancer. Our results indicate that AMP-001 sensitizes gastric cancer cells which resulted in expanding the therapeutic index of front-line chemotherapy doxorubicin both in vitro and in vivo nude mouse model. The synergy between AMP-001 and doxorubicin could pave a new pathway to use AMP-001 as a neoadjuvant to chemotherapy to achieve a better efficacy and reduced off-target toxicity.","Background and Aims Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the most common cause of liver disease contributing to significant disease burden worldwide. However, there is lack of comparison of efficacy between different NASH drug classes. We conducted a network meta-analysis evaluating drug classes through comparing histological outcomes and targets of drugs.","The aim of our research was to examine the effects of crocin (0.5 (C0.5), 1 (C1) and 1.5 (C1.5) mM) and naringenin (50 (N50), 100 (N100) and 150 (N150) \u00b5M) in cryopreservation extender for freezing rooster semen. Sperm motility, viability, abnormalities, membrane integrity, mitochondrial activity, apoptosis status, lipid peroxidation (LP), GPX, SOD, TAC, the mRNA expression of pro-apoptotic (CASPASE 3) and anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2) genes, fertility and hatchability rate were investigated following freeze-thawing. C1 and N100 resulted in the higher (P &lt; 0.05) total motility and progressive motility in comparison to the control group. C1 and N100 improved viability, membrane integrity and reduced lipid peroxidation. We found much higher values for mitochondria activity with C1 and N100 respect to the control group. The C1 and N100 showed lower percentages of early apoptosis when compared with control group. Also, C1 and N100 had higher TAC when compared with control group. The mRNA expression of BCL-2 in the C1 and N100 group were significantly higher than that of other treatments. The expression of CASPASES 3 was significantly reduced in C1 and N100 group (P &lt; 0.05) when compared to control group. Significantly higher percentage of fertility and hatching rate were observed in C1 and N100 compared to the control group. In conclusion, crocin at 1 mM and naringenin at 100 \u00b5M seem to improve the post-thawing rooster semen quality, fertility and could protect the sperm against excessive ROS generation by reducing the pro-apoptotic (CASPASE 3) and increasing anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2) genes.","Recent advances in single-cell genomics and transcriptomics technologies have transformed our understanding of cellular heterogeneity in growth, development, ageing and disease. Despite these advances, however, single-cell metabolite profiling (i.e., metabolomics) methods have comparatively lagged behind due to limitations in technology. We have developed a high-throughput method for the detection and quantification of a wide range of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and sphingomyelin (SM) species from single cells that combines fluorescence-assisted cell sorting (FACS) with automated chip-based nanoelectrospray ionisation (nanoESI) and shotgun lipidomics. We show herein that our method is capable of quantifying more than 50 different PC and SM species from single cells and can easily distinguish between cells of different lineages or cells treated with exogenous fatty acids. Moreover, our method can detect more subtle differences in the lipidome between cell lines of the same cancer type. Our approach has the capacity to be run in parallel with other single-cell technologies to deliver near-complete multi-omics data on cells with a similar phenotype and has the capacity to significantly advance our current knowledge on cellular heterogeneity.","It is important to search for new sources of bioactive, natural compounds because customers pay more attention to food quality. Fruits and berries from horticultural plants are known to be good sources of agents beneficial for human well-being and could serve as natural preservatives in the food industry. However, more recent research indicates that other plant organs can also be rich in nutrients. Our study focused on characterizing an unexplored source: leaf and twig extracts from Rosa canina. The chemical composition of these extracts was analyzed and their in vitro activity measured. HPLC analysis of the content of phenolics, vitamins and amino acids revealed that the leaf and twig extracts are rich in bioactive compounds with potent antioxidant properties. The greatest differences between bioactive phenolic compounds in leaf and twig extracts related mainly to p-coumaric acid, myricetin, ellagic acid, cyanidin, procyanidin and quercetin, whereas salicylic acid levels were similar in both types of extract.","Age-related deterioration within both motor neurones and monoaminergic systems should theoretically reduce neuromodulation by weakening motor neuronal persistent inward current (PIC) amplitude. However, this assumption remains untested. Surface electromyographic signals were collected using two 32-channel electrode matrices placed on soleus and tibialis anterior of 25 older adults (70\u00b14years) and 17 young adults (29\u00b15 years) to investigate motor unit discharge behaviours. Participants performed triangular-shaped plantar and dorsiflexion contractions to 20% of maximum torque at a rise-decline rate of 2%/s of each participant\u2019s maximal torque. Pairwise and composite paired-motor unit analyses were adopted to calculate delta frequency (\u0394F), which has been used to differentiate between the effects of synaptic excitation and intrinsic motor neuronal properties and is assumed to be proportional to PIC amplitude. Soleus and tibialis anterior motor units in older adults had lower \u0394Fs calculated with either the pairwise [\u22120.99 and \u22121.46 pps; \u221235.4 and \u2212 33.5%, respectively] or composite (\u22121.18 and \u22122.28 pps; \u221232.1 and \u221245.2%, respectively) methods. Their motor units also had lower peak discharge rates (\u22122.14 and \u22122.03 pps; \u221219.7 and \u221213.9%, respectively) and recruitment thresholds (\u22121.50 and \u22122.06% of maximum, respectively) than young adults. These results demonstrate reduced intrinsic motor neurone excitability during low-force contractions in older adults, likely mediated by decreases in the amplitude of persistent inward currents. Our findings might be explained by deterioration in the motor neurones or monoaminergic systems and could contribute to the decline in motor function during ageing; these assumptions should be explicitly tested in future investigations.","After the presentation of a visual stimulus, cortical visual processing cascades from low-level sensory features in primary visual areas to increasingly abstract representations in higher-level areas. It is often hypothesized that the reverse process underpins the human ability to generate mental images. Under this hypothesis, visual information feeds back from high-level areas as abstract representations are used to construct the sensory representation in primary visual cortices. Such reversals of information flow are also hypothesized to play a central role in later stages of perception. According to predictive processing theories, ambiguous sensory information is resolved using abstract representations coming from high-level areas through oscillatory rebounds between different levels of the visual hierarchy. However, despite the elegance of these theoretical models, to this day there is no direct experimental evidence of the reversion of visual information flow during mental imagery and perception. In the first part of this paper, we provide direct evidence in humans for a reverse order of activation of the visual hierarchy during imagery. Specifically, we show that classification machine learning models trained on brain data at different time points during the early feedforward phase of perception are reactivated in reverse order during mental imagery. In the second part of the paper, we report an 11Hz oscillatory pattern of feedforward and reversed visual processing phases during perception. Together, these results are in line with the idea that during perception, the high-level cause of sensory input is inferred through recurrent hypothesis updating, whereas during imagery, this learned forward mapping is reversed to generate sensory signals given abstract representations.","Neurometabolic diseases are a group of individually rare but numerous and heterogeneous genetic diseases best known to paediatricians. The more recently reported adult forms may present with phenotypes strikingly different from paediatric ones and may mimic other more common neurological disorders in adults. Furthermore, unlike most neurogenetic diseases, many neurometabolic diseases are treatable, with both conservative and more recent innovative therapeutics. However, the phenotypical complexity of this group of diseases and the growing number of specialised biochemical tools account for a significant diagnostic delay and underdiagnosis. We reviewed all series and case reports of patients with a confirmed neurometabolic disease and a neurological onset after the age of 10 years, with a focus on the 36 treatable ones, and classified these diseases according to their most relevant clinical manifestations. The biochemical diagnostic approach of neurometabolic diseases lays on the use of numerous tests studying a set of metabolites, an enzymatic activity or the function of a given pathway; and therapeutic options aim to restore the enzyme activity or metabolic function, limit the accumulation of toxic substrates or substitute the deficient products. A quick diagnosis of a treatable neurometabolic disease can have a major impact on patients, leading to the stabilisation of the disease and cease of repeated diagnostic investigations, and allowing for familial screening. For the aforementioned, in addition to an exhaustive and clinically meaningful review of these diseases, we propose a simplified diagnostic approach for the neurologist with the aim to help determine when to suspect a neurometabolic disease and how to proceed in a rational manner. We also discuss the place of next-generation sequencing technologies in the diagnostic process, for which deep phenotyping of patients (both clinical and biochemical) is necessary for improving their diagnostic yield. ","Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) plays a primary role in regulating the activity of many signaling molecules. Increased FAK expression has been implicated in a series of cellular processes, including cell migration and survival. Inhibiting the activity of FAK for cancer therapy is currently under investigation. Hence, FAK and its inhibitors has been the subject of intensive research. To understand the structural factors affecting inhibitory potency, kinetic analysis, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation were studied in this project. Though, Solanesol was found have inhibitory activities towards FAK, no in silico tests were ever done on the same.","The miRNA miR-124 has been employed supplementary to neurogenic TFs and other miRNAs to enhance direct neurogenic conversion by suppressing multiple non-neuronal targets. Aim of the study was to investigate whether miR-124 is sufficient to drive direct reprogramming of astrocytes to induced-neurons (iNs) on its own and elucidate its independent mechanism of reprogramming action. Our data show that miR-124 is a potent driver of the reprogramming switch of astrocytes towards an immature neuronal fate, by directly targeting the RNA-binding protein Zfp36l1 implicated in ARE-mediated mRNA decay and subsequently de-repressing Zfp36l1 neurogenic interactome. To this end miR-124 contribution in iNs production largely recapitulates endogenous neurogenesis pathways, being further enhanced upon addition of the neurogenic compound ISX9, which greatly improves both miR-124-induced reprogramming efficiency and iNs functional maturation. Importantly, miR-124 is potent to guide direct conversion of reactive astrocytes to immature iNs of cortical identity in vivo following cortical trauma, confirming its master reprogramming capacity within the injured cortical microenvironment, while ISX9 supplementation confers a survival advantage to newly produced iNs.","Malignant melanoma is one of the most common types of cancer in the United States. Despite recent and well-described progress in melanoma treatment, advanced disease still carries a poor prognosis for many patients and chemotherapy has been appropriately abandoned as a front-line option. Wild-type isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (wtIDH1) has recently been implicated as a metabolic dependency in cancer. The enzyme is protective to cancer cells under metabolic stress, including oxidative damage by conventional chemotherapy and nutrient limitation characteristic of the tumor microenvironment. Specifically, the cytosolic enzyme generates NADPH to maintain redox homeostasis. IDH1 also supports mitochondrial function through anaplerosis of its reaction product, \u03b1-ketoglutarate. We show that melanoma patients express higher levels of the wtIDH1 enzyme compared to normal skin tissue, and elevated wtIDH1 expression portends poor patient survival. Knockdown of IDH1 by RNA interference inhibited cell proliferation and migration under low nutrient levels. Suppression of IDH1 expression in melanoma also decreased NADPH and glutathione levels, resulting in increased reactive oxygen species. An FDA-approved inhibitor of mutant IDH1, ivosidenib (AG-120), exhibited potent anti-wtIDH1 properties under low magnesium and nutrient levels, reflective of the tumor microenvironment in natura. Similarly, findings were replicated in murine models of melanoma. Further, wtIDH1 inhibition was synergistic to conventional anti-melanoma chemotherapy in pre-clinical models. This work points to a novel and readily available combination treatment strategy for patients with advanced and refractory melanoma.","Malaria still presents great epidemiologic importance by its high incidence in the world and potential clinical severity. Plasmodium parasites are highly susceptible to changes in the redox balance and the relationship between the redox state of the parasite and host cells is very complex and involves nitric oxide (NO) synthesis. Thus, the present study is aimed at evaluating the effects of NO synthesis on the redox status, parasitemia evolution and survival rate of Plasmodium berghei-infected mice. Two-hundred and twenty-five mice were infected with Plasmodium berghei and submitted to the stimulation or inhibition of NO synthesis. The stimulation of NO synthesis was performed through the administration of L-arginine, while its inhibition was made by the administration of dexamethasone. Inducible NO synthase (iNOS) inhibition by dexamethasone promoted an increase in the survival rate of P. berghei-infected mice and data suggested the participation of oxidative stress in brain as a result of plasmodial infection, as well as the inhibition of brain NO synthesis, which promoted survival rate of almost 90% of the animals until the 15th day of infection, with possible direct interference of ischemia and reperfusion syndrome, as seen by increased levels of uric acid. Inhibition of iNOS caused a decrease of parasitemia and increased survival rate of infected animals, suggesting that the synthesis of NO may stimulate a series of compensatory redox effects that, if overstimulated, may be responsible for the onset of severe forms of malaria.","Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a mycotoxin produced by secondary metabolism of several fungibelonging to the genera Aspergillus and Penicillium. OTAis potentially nephrotoxic, neurotoxic, immunotoxic and carcinogenic in several animalspecies and in humans. This toxin has been detected in several human food and animal feed.The aim of this study was to determine OTA in blood samples of healthy and affected bychronic kidney disease (CKD) dogs. CKD group showed higher incidence of OTA-positivitythan healthy dogs (96 vs. 56%) and a significantly higher median value of OTA plasmaconcentration (0.008 vs. 0.144 ng/ml).No significant correlation was observed between OTA levels and creatinine values in CKDdogs. This is the first study regarding OTA detection in plasma samples of healthy and CKDdogs; the presence of this toxin is higher in nephropatic patients but is not yet clear,if it is correlated with progression of the disease. ","The denitrosylating enzyme S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR), has been reported to control the selective degradation of mitochondria through mitophagy, by modulating the extent of nitric oxide-modified proteins (S-nitrosylation). The accumulation of S-nitrosylated proteins due to GSNOR downregulation is a feature of hepatocellular carcinoma, causing mitochondrial defects that sensitize these tumors to mitochondrial toxins, in particular to mitochondrial complex II inhibitor alpha-tocopheryl succinate (\u03b1TOS). However, it is not known if mitophagy defects contribute to GSNOR-deficient cancer cells sensitivity to \u03b1TOS, nor if mitophagy inhibition could be used as a common mechanism to sensitize liver cancers to this toxin. Here, we provide evidence that GSNOR-deficient cancer cells show defective mitophagy. Furthermore, we show that \u03b1TOS is a mitophagy inducer and that mitophagy defects of GSNOR-deficient liver cancer cells contribute to its toxicity. We finally prove that the inhibition of mitophagy by depletion of Parkin, a pivotal ubiquitin ligase targeting mitochondria for degradation, enhances \u03b1TOS toxicity, thus suggesting that this drug could be effective in treating mitophagy-defective tumors.","Background Unique amongst brain stimulation tools, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) currently lacks an easy method for individualizing dosage.","Clubroot caused by the protist Plasmodiophora brassicae is a major disease affecting cultivated Brassicaceae. Here, we uncover the existence of a natural epigenetic variation that is associated with partial resistance to clubroot in Arabidopsis, by using QTL fine mapping followed by extensive DNA sequence and methylation analyses. We show that at QTL Pb-At5.2, DNA methylation variation is extensive across accessions and strictly correlates with expression variation of the two neighboring genes At5g47260 and At5g47280, which encode NLR-immune receptors. Moreover, these natural variants are stably inherited and are not consistently associated with any nucleotide variation. These findings suggest a direct role for epigenetic variation in quantitative resistance of plants to pathogen attacks.","Importance Given that many midlife women use evidence-based non-pharmacologic interventions for symptom management during the menopausal transition and early postmenopause and that many women experience two or more symptoms (symptom cluster), it is important to review recent evidence on said interventions for symptom clusters. This review focuses on randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of traditional East Asian Medicine (TEAM), including acupuncture, acupressure, moxibustion, and Chinese herbal medicine, for hot flashes and one or more co-occurring symptoms experienced during peri- or post-menopause.","The inability to maintain a strictly regulated endo(lyso)somal acidic pH through the proton-pumping action of the vacuolar-ATPases has been associated with various human diseases including heritable connective tissue disorders, neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. Multiple studies have investigated the pleiotropic effects of reduced acidification in vitro, but the mechanisms elicited by impaired endo(lyso)somal acidification in vivo remain poorly understood. Here, we show that loss of atp6v1e1b in zebrafish leads to early mortality, associated with craniofacial dysmorphisms, vascular anomalies, cardiac dysfunction, hypotonia and epidermal structural defects, reminiscent of the phenotypic manifestations in cutis laxa patients carrying a defect in the ATP6V1E1 gene. Mechanistically, we found that in vivo genetic depletion of atp6v1e1b leads to N-glycosylation defects and reduced maturation of endosomal and lysosomal vesicles, but retains the hypoxia-mediated response. In order to gain further insights into the processes affected by aberrant organelle acidification, we performed an untargeted analysis of the transcriptome and metabolome in early atp6v1e1b-deficient larvae. We report multiple affected pathways including but not limited to oxidative phosphorylation, sphingolipid and fatty acid metabolism with profound defects in mitochondrial respiration. Taken together, our results identify new complex biological effects of reduced organelle acidification in vivo, which likely contribute to the multisystemic manifestations observed in disorders caused by v-ATPase deficiency.","The developing brain is especially vulnerable to infection and suboptimal nutrition during the pre- and early postnatal periods. Exposure to maternal HIV infection and antiretroviral therapies (ART) in utero and during breastfeeding can adversely influence infant (neuro)developmental trajectories. How early life nutrition may be optimised to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes for infants who are HIV/ART-exposed has not been well characterised. We conducted an up-to-date evidence review and meta-analysis on the influence of HIV exposure in utero and during breastfeeding, and early life nutrition, on infant neurodevelopmental outcomes before age three. We report that exposure to maternal HIV infection/ART may adversely influence expressive language development, in particular, and these effects may be detectable within the first three years of life. Further, while male infants may be especially vulnerable to HIV/ART exposure, few studies overall reported sex-comparisons, and whether there are sex-dependent effects of HIV exposure on neurodevelopment remains a critical knowledge gap to fill. Lastly, early life nutrition interventions, including daily maternal multivitamin supplementation during the perinatal period, may improve neurodevelopmental outcomes for infants who are HIV-exposed. Our findings suggest that the early nutritional environment may be leveraged to improve early neurodevelopmental trajectories in infants who have been exposed to HIV in utero. A clear understanding of how this environment should be optimised is key for developing targeted nutrition interventions during critical developmental periods in order to mitigate adverse outcome later in life, and should be a priority of future research.","Mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with a range of clinical manifestations including neuropsychiatric and metabolic disorder. Here, we reanalyzed a family with an L-Histidine Decarboxylase (HDC) variant previously linked to Tourette syndrome but with associated connective tissue and metabolic features of unknown etiology. We identified a mitochondrial haplogroup J-defining mutation on the haplogroup H background that functionally interacts with the L-Histidine Decarboxylase variant via calcium homeostasis. Our findings establish how a common mtDNA variant on a different mtDNA background can result in mitochondrial dysfunction, demonstrate a role for histaminergic signaling in modifying mitochondrial phenotypes, and link mitochondria dysfunction to connective tissue phenotypes.","The development of alternatives to antibiotics is crucial to limiting the incidence of antimicrobial resistance, especially in prophylactic and metaphylactic use to control post-weaning diarrhea (PWD). Feed additives, including bioactive compounds, could be a promising alternative. This study aimed to test two bioactive compounds, sodium salicylate (SA) and a chestnut extract (CE) containing hydrolysable tannins, on the occurrence of PWD. At weaning, 72 piglets were assigned to four treatments that combined two factors: CE supplementation (with 2% of CE (CE+) or without (CE-)) and SA supplementation (with 35 mg/kg BW of SA (SA+) or without (SA-)). Then, 4 days after weaning, all piglets were infected with a suspension at 108 CFU/ml of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC F4ac). Each piglet had free access to an electrolyte solution containing, or not, SA. This SA supplementation was administered for 5 days (i.e., from the day of infection (day 0) to 4 days post-infection (day 4). During the 2 weeks post-infection, supplementation with SA had no effect (P &gt; 0.05) on growth performances nor on fecal scores. A significant SA \u00d7 time interaction (P &lt; 0.01) for fecal scores and the percentage of diarrhea indicated that piglets with SA did not recover faster and did have a second episode of diarrhea. In contrast to SA treatment, inclusion of CE increased (P &lt; 0.05) growth performances and feed intake. In the first week post-infection, CE decreased (P &lt; 0.001) the overall fecal scores, the percentage of piglets with diarrhea, the days in diarrhea, and ETEC shedding in the feces. There was a SA\u00d7CE interaction (P &lt; 0.05) for ETEC shedding, suggesting a negative effect of combining SA with CE. This study highlighted that, in contrast to SA, CE could represent a promising alternative to antibiotics immediately after weaning for improving growth performance and reducing PWD.","Early life experiences can be important in determining offspring phenotypes and may influence interaction with the environment and hence health, welfare, and productivity. The prenatal environment of poultry can be divided into the pre-lay environment and the egg storage/incubation environment, both of which can affect offspring outcomes. The ability to separate maternal and egg/incubation effects makes birds well suited to this type of research. There are many factors, including feeding and nutrition, environmental conditions, husbandry practices, housing system, social environment, infectious environment, and maternal health status, that can influence both the health and performance and behavior and cognition of the offspring. There are some aspects of the environments that can be changed to produce beneficial effects in the offspring, like addition of certain additives to feed or short changes in incubation temperatures, while other aspects should be avoided to reduce negative effects, such as unpredictable feeding and lighting regimens. Measures of offspring characteristics may prove to be a useful method of assessing parent stock welfare if known stressors result in predictable offspring outcomes. This has the advantage of assessing the parent environment without interfering with the animals and possibly affecting their responses and could lead to improved welfare for the animals. ","Developing drugs for treating Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) has been extremely challenging and costly due to limited knowledge on underlying biological mechanisms and therapeutic targets. Repurposing drugs or their combination has shown potential in accelerating drug development due to the reduced drug toxicity while targeting multiple pathologies. To address the challenge in AD drug development, we developed a multi-task machine learning pipeline to integrate a comprehensive knowledge graph on biological/pharmacological interactions and multi-level evidence on drug efficacy, to identify repurposable drugs and their combination candidates. We developed and computationally validated a heterogeneous graph representation model with transfer learning from universal biomedical databases and with joint optimization with AD risk genes. Using the drug embedding from the heterogeneous graph representation model, we ranked drug candidates based on evidence from post-treatment transcriptomic patterns, mechanistic efficacy in preclinical models, population-based treatment effect, and Phase II/III clinical trials. We experimentally validated the top-ranked candidates in neuronal cells, identifying drug combinations with efficacy in reducing oxidative stress and safety in maintaining neuronal viability and morphology. Our neuronal response experiments confirmed several biologically efficacious drug combinations (e.g., Galantamine + Mifepristone). This pipeline showed that harmonizing heterogeneous and complementary data/knowledge, including human interactome, transcriptome patterns, experimental efficacy, and real-world patient data shed light on the drug development of complex diseases.","","A total of 6,628 PUBMED-registered publications on the relationships between the effects of vaccination and the provision of micronutrients have been studied by methods of topological analysis of text data. In case of insufficient intake of certain micronutrients, the functioning of the acquired immunity is disrupted resulting in an imbalance of populations of T-cells CD4+/CD8+ and of B-lymphocytes. Nutritional supplements of folate, vitamins A, D and B12, which are recognized regulators of cell division, support a wide range of lymphocyte populations. Trace elements zinc, iron, selenium, manganese and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are also important for supporting the mechanisms of acquired immunity. The data presented show that a course intake of these micronutrients by patients planning vaccination can significantly improve its effectiveness. In particular, these micronutrients can increase the titers of antibodies to pathogens, and to reduce the percentage of patients who still contract infection after vaccination. Supplements of these micronutrients can also contribute to the safety of vaccination: to prevent malaise and, in the unfortunate case of contracting infection despite the vaccine, to reduce the severity of the course and the mortality from the corresponding infection.","\u03b2-Amyloid deposition as fibrillar plaques in brain is the primary cause of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. We report potency of cysteine protease \u2018fruit bromelain\u2019 from pineapple in destabilising A\u03b2 fibrils. Bromelain peptide pool (Mw&lt;500 Da) obtained mimicking human alimentary tract digestion inhibited fibrillation from monomeric and oligomeric states of A and irreversibly dissociated preformed fibrils into small oligomers of varied sizes. Time kinetics was followed by Thioflavin-T assay and microscopic imaging. Synthetic bromelain peptides corresponding to A\u03b2 sticky region found using ClustalW analysis revealed specificity of peptides in destabilisation of amyloidal structures. Spectra of different molecular states of A\u03b2 obtained from application of 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid, circular dichroism and Fourier-Transformed Infrared spectroscopy collectively indicated interaction dependent structural change. Probable mechanism for fibril dissociation was thus predicted. Peptides relieved A\u03b2 cytotoxicity on pheochromcytoma cells and dissociated plaques in AD-type rats prepared by bilateral intracerebroventricular administration of A\u03b2 in rat brain cortex. Pineapple being a phytoceutical, its efficiency to disaggregate amyloid bodies warrant further investigation.","The increasing availability of fully sequenced cyanobacterial genomes opens unprecedented opportunities to investigate the manifold adaptations and functional relationships that determine the genetic content of individual bacterial species. Here, we use comparative genome analysis to investigate the cyanobacterial pan-genome based on 77 strains whose complete genome sequence is available. Our focus is the co-occurrence of likely ortholog genes, denoted as CLOGs. We conjecture that co-occurrence CLOGs is indicative of functional relationships between the respective genes. Going beyond the analysis of pair-wise co-occurrences, we introduce a novel network approach to identify modules of co-occurring ortholog genes. Our results demonstrate that these modules exhibit a high degree of functional coherence and reveal known as well as previously unknown functional relationships. We argue that the high functional coherence observed for the extracted modules is a consequence of the similar-yet-diverse nature of the cyanobacterial phylum. We provide a simple toolbox that facilitates further analysis of our results with respect to specific cyanobacterial genes of interest.","The pentose phosphate pathway is a major source of NADPH for oxidative stress resistance in cancer cells but there is limited insight into its role in metastasis, when some cancer cells experience high levels of oxidative stress. To test this, we mutated the substrate binding site of Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), which catalyzes the first step of the pentose phosphate pathway, in patient-derived melanomas. G6PD mutant melanomas had significantly decreased G6PD enzymatic activity and depletion of intermediates in the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway. Reduced G6PD function had little effect on the formation of primary subcutaneous tumors but when these tumors spontaneously metastasized the frequency of circulating melanoma cells in the blood and metastatic disease burden were significantly reduced. G6PD mutant melanomas exhibited increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), decreased NADPH levels, and depleted glutathione as compared to control melanomas. G6PD mutant melanomas compensated for this increase in oxidative stress by increasing the production of NADPH through glutaminolysis. This generated a new metabolic vulnerability as G6PD mutant melanomas were more dependent upon glutamine as compared to control melanomas. The oxidative pentose phosphate pathway and compensatory glutaminolysis thus confer layered protection against oxidative stress during metastasis.","Pathogenic variants in MFN2 cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) type 2A (CMT2A) and are the leading cause of the axonal subtypes of CMT. CMT2A is characterized by predominantly distal motor weakness and muscle atrophy, with highly variable severity and onset age. Notably, some MFN2 variants can also lead to other phenotypes such as optic atrophy, hearing loss and lipodystrophy. Despite the clear link between MFN2 and CMT2A, our mechanistic understanding of how dysfunction of the MFN2 protein causes human disease pathologies remains incomplete. This lack of understanding is due in part to the multiple cellular roles of MFN2. Though initially characterized for its role in mediating mitochondrial fusion, MFN2 also plays important roles in mediating interactions between mitochondria and other organelles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum and lipid droplets. Additionally, MFN2 is also important for mitochondrial transport, mitochondrial autophagy, and has even been implicated in lipid transfer. Though over 100 pathogenic MFN2 variants have been described to date, only a few have been characterized functionally, and even then, often only for one or two functions. Here, we describe a novel homozygous MFN2 variant, D414V, in a patient presenting with cerebellar ataxia, deafness, blindness, and diffuse cerebral and cerebellar atrophy. Characterization of patient fibroblasts reveals phenotypes consistent with impaired MFN2 functions and expands the phenotypic presentation of MFN2 variants to include cerebellar ataxia.","Reduction of waste from food industry and food services is a current concern due to the large amount of waste generated, including peels and fruit seeds. The objective of this study was to obtain a flour produced from Cantaloupe melon seeds (Cucumis melo L. var. reticulatus) and to evaluate the viability of using the product as an ingredient in cake manufacturing. In this study, different formulations were developed: standard cake \u2013 0% (F1) and cakes containing melon seed flour as substitute of wheat flour in 10% (F2), 30% (F3), and 50% (F4) concentrations. Centesimal composition, dietary fibre, structural and morphological characterization, determination of mineral composition, and evaluation of fatty acids profile in melon seed flour were carried out. To determine the overall acceptance of cake formulations, sensory analysis was performed with 135 non-trained panelists, which also included the identification of sensorial attributes using the Just About Right ideal scale test. The results showed that the melon seed flour has considerable nutritional value, with 18% proteins, 3% moisture, 4% ash, 30% lipids, and 35% dietary fibre. Melon flour also has a significantly high content of minerals, mainly phosphorus (1507.62 mg/100 g), potassium (957.35 mg/100 g), and magnesium (504.03 mg/100 g). The polyunsaturated fatty acid fraction was the most abundant in melon seed flour, with predominance of omega-6 fatty acids (17.95 g/mg of sample). Sensorial analysis disclosed good acceptance for formulations containing 10% and 30% of melon seed flour, with the 10% formulation being the most accepted. The research showed the feasibility of using the melon seed flour in cake production, as well as the possibility of using food waste in restaurants and food industries in order to adhere to sustainable production actions.","The extract of G. officinalis was separated by five major fractions and the antitumor activity of hydrophobic fractions has been established. For the most active fractions spectral investigations of the main component were performed using UV-Vis electronic spectra, circular dichroism (CD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. On the basis of spectral characteristics, it was demonstrated that the main components of the fractions 4 and 5 of G. officinalis providing its biological activity, highly likely, are of flavonoid nature. Based on the NMR data we propose the structure of the aglycon moiety of the main component from fraction 4 as 4,2\u2019,5\u2019-trihydroxychalcone. The fraction 5 is the most active, the antitumor effect of which is implemented through cytotoxic, cytostatic, apoptotic and autophagosomal activity in respect to human kidney cancer tumor cells.","Vitamin E exists in eight different forms, four tocopherols and four tocotrienols. It forms an important component of our antioxidant system. The structure of Vitamin E makes it unique and indispensable in protecting cell membranes. a-tocopherol, one of the forms of Vitamin E, is also known to regulate signal transduction pathways by mechanisms that are independent of its antioxidant properties. Vitamin E compounds reduce the production of inflammatory compounds such as prostaglandins. Swollen, dystrophic axons are considered as the hallmark of Vitamin E deficiency in the brains of rats, monkeys, and humans. The present work aimed to study the Vitamin E- (a-tochopherol acetate-) induced alterations of enzymes involved in metabolism of Glutamate and GABA during developmental neurogenesis of cerebrum. Therefore, cytosolic and crude mitochondrial enzyme activities of glutamine synthetase, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, GABA transaminase, succinic Semialdehyde dehydrogenase, glutamic dehydrogenase, and a-Ketoglutarate dehydrogenase were analysed. Vitamin E induced significant changes in these enzymes thus altering the normal levels of glutamate and GABA during developmental neurogenesis. Such changes are surely to disturb the expression and/or intensity of neurotransmitter signaling during critical periods of brain development. ","Obesity is the main component of metabolic syndromes involving distinct etiologies which target different underlying behavioral and physiological functions within the brain structures and neuronal circuits. An alteration in the neuronal circuitry stemming from abdominal or central obesity stimulates a cascade of changes in neurochemical signaling that directly or indirectly mediate spontaneously emitted behaviors such as locomotor activity patterns, anxiety and exploration. Pharmacological agents available for the treatment of neurologic disorders have been associated with limited potency and intolerable adverse effects. These have necessitated the upsurge in utilization of herbal prescriptions due to their affordability, easy accessibility and are firmly embedded within wider belief systems of many people. Gnidia glauca has been used in management of many ailments including obesity and associated symptomatic complications. However, its upsurge in use has not been accompanied with authentication of these folkloric claims. The present study aimed to determine the modulatory effect of Dichloromethane leaf extract of Gnidia glauca on locomotor activity, exploration and anxiety-like behaviors in high fat diet-induced obese rats in an Open Field Arena. Obesity was experimentally induced by feeding the rats with prepared high fat diet and water ad libitum for a period of 6 weeks. The in-vivo anti-obesity effects were determined by oral administration of G. glauca at dosage levels of 200, 250 and 300mg/kg body weight in high fat diet-induced obese rats from the 6th to 12th week. Phytochemical analysis was done using gas chromatography linked to mass spectroscopy. Results indicated that Gnidia glauca showed anxiolytic effects and significantly increased spontaneous locomotor activity and exploration-like behaviors in HFD-induced obese rats. The plant extract also contained phytocompounds that have been associated with amelioration of the main neurodegenerative mediators viz inflammation and oxidative stress. These findings provide \u2018qualified leads\u2019 for the synthesis of new alternative therapeutic agent for management of neurologic disorders. However, there\u2019s need to conduct toxicity studies of Gnidia glauca to establish its safety profiles.","Leptin has been suggested to play a role in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal progressive and neurodegenerative disease. This adipokine has previously been shown to be associated with a lower risk of ALS disease and to confer a survival advantage in ALS patients. However, the role of leptin in the progression of ALS is unknown. Indeed, our understanding of the mechanisms underlying leptin\u2019s effects in the pathogenesis of ALS is very limited, and it is fundamental to determine whether alterations in leptin\u2019s actions take place in this neurodegenerative disease. To characterize the association between leptin signaling and the clinical course of ALS we assessed the mRNA and protein expression profiles of leptin, the long leptin receptor (Ob-Rb) and leptin-related signaling pathways over the time course of the disease (onset and end-stage of disease), in TDP-43A315T mice compared to age-matched WT littermates. In addition, at the selected time-points immunoassay analysis was conducted to characterize plasma levels of total ghrelin, the adipokines (resistin and leptin) and metabolic proteins (plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1), gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP), glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP-1), insulin and glucagon) in TDP-43A315T mice compared to WT controls. Our results indicate alterations in leptin signaling in the spinal cord and the hypothalamus on the backdrop of TDP-43-induced deficits in mice, providing new evidence about the pathways that could link leptin signaling to ALS.","Spondylometaphyseal dysplasia, Sedaghatian type (SMDS) is a rare and lethal skeletal dysplasia inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and caused by mutations in GPX4. In order to expand the functional landscape of this poorly studied disorder and accelerate the discovery of biologically insightful and clinically actionable targets, we constructed SMDS-centric and GPX4-centric protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, augmented with novel protein interactors predicted by our HiPPIP algorithm. The SMDS-centric networks included those that showed the interconnections of GPX4 with other putative SMDS-associated genes and genes associated with other skeletal dysplasias. The GPX4-centric network showed the interconnections of GPX4 with genes whose perturbation has been known to affect GPX4 expression. We discovered that these networks either contained or were enriched with genes associated with specific SMDS pathophenotypes, tissue-na\u00efve/fetus-specific functional modules and genes showing elevated expression in brain and/or testis similar to GPX4. We identified 7 proteins as novel interactors of GPX4 (APBA3, EGR4, FUT5, GAMT, GTF2F1, MATK and ZNF197) and showed their potential biological relevance to GPX4 or SMDS. Comparative transcriptome analysis of expression profiles associated with chondroplasia and immune-osseous dysplasia versus drug-induced profiles revealed 11 drugs that targeted the neighborhood network of GPX4 and other putative SMDS-associated genes. Additionally, resveratrol, which is currently being tested against a skeletal dysplasia in a clinical trial, was identified as another potential candidate based on the proximity of its targets to GPX4.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder defined by motor impairments that include rigidity, systemic slowdown of movement (bradykinesia), postural problems, and tremor. While the progressive decline in motor output functions is well documented, less understood are impairments linked to the continuous kinesthetic sensation emerging from the flow of motions. There is growing evidence in recent years that kinesthetic problems are also part of the symptoms of PD, but objective methods to readily quantify continuously unfolding motions across different contexts have been lacking. Here we present evidence from a deafferented subject (IW) and a new statistical platform that enables new analyses of motor output variability measured as a continuous flow of kinesthetic reafferent input. Systematic increasing similarities between the patterns of motor output variability in IW and the participants with increasing degrees of PD severity suggest potential deficits in kinesthetic sensing in PD. We propose that these deficits may result from persistent, noisy, and random motor patterns as the disorder progresses. The stochastic signatures from the unfolding motions revealed levels of noise in the motor output fluctuations of these patients bound to decrease the kinesthetic signal's bandwidth. The results are interpreted in light of the concept of kinesthetic reafference ( , ). In this context, noisy motor output variability from voluntary movements in PD leads to a returning stream of noisy afference caused, in turn, by those faulty movements themselves. Faulty efferent output re-enters the CNS as corrupted sensory motor input. We find here that severity level in PD leads to the persistence of such patterns, thus bringing the statistical signatures of the subjects with PD systematically closer to those of the subject without proprioception. ","Platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) have been investigated for their antioxidant abilities in a range of biological and other applications. The ability to reduce off-target CAP cytotoxicity would be useful in Plasma Medicine, however, little has been published to date about the ability of PtNPs to reduce or inhibit the effects of CAP. Here we investigate whether PtNPs can protect against CAP-induced cytotoxicity in cancerous and non-cancerous cell lines. PtNPs were shown to dramatically reduce intracellular reactive species (RONS) production in human U-251 MG cells. However, RONS generation was unaffected by PtNPs in medium without cells. PtNPs protect against CAP induced mitochondrial membrane depolarization, but not cell membrane permeabilization which is a CAP-induced RONS-independent event. PtNPs act as potent intracellular scavengers of reactive species and can protect both cancerous U-251 MG cells and non-cancerous HEK293 cells against CAP induced cytotoxicity. PtNPs may be useful as a catalytic antioxidant for healthy tissue and for protecting against CAP-induced tissue damage.","Current targeted cancer therapies are largely guided by mutations of a single gene, which overlooks concurrent genomic alterations. Here, we show that RNASEH2B, RB1, and BRCA2, three closely located genes on chromosome 13q, are frequently deleted in prostate cancer individually or jointly. Loss of RNASEH2B confers cancer cells sensitivity to poly(ADP\u2013ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition due to impaired ribonucleotide excision repair and PARP trapping. When co-deleted with RB1, however, cells lose their sensitivity, in part, through E2F1-induced BRCA2 expression, thereby enhancing homologous recombination repair capacity. Nevertheless, loss of BRCA2 re-sensitizes RNASEH2B/RB1 co-deleted cells to PARP inhibition. Our results may explain some of the disparate clinical results from PARP inhibition due to interaction between multiple genomic alterations and support a comprehensive genomic testing to determine who may benefit from PARP inhibition. Finally, we show that ATR inhibition can disrupt E2F1-induced BRCA2 expression and overcome PARP inhibitor resistance caused by RB1 loss.","Ferroptosis is a non-apoptotic form of cell death linked to the accumulation of reactive hydroperoxides generated by oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in membrane phospholipids. The therapeutic potential of promoting ferroptosis by enriching PUFAs in cancer cells is unknown. We found an association between elevated PUFA levels and vulnerability to ferroptosis in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. A screen of PUFAs identified conjugated linolenic acids, including \u03b1-eleostearate, as ferroptosis inducers. Three conjugated double bonds were required for ferroptotic activity although their positioning and stereochemistry were less significant. Mechanistically, \u03b1-eleostearate differed from canonical ferroptosis inducers by a distinct dependence on acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain isoforms and by not altering glutathione or glutathione peroxidase 4 activity. Orally administered tung oil, naturally rich in \u03b1-eleostearate, limited tumor growth and metastasis in an aggressive TNBC xenograft model. These results expand our understanding of ferroptotic cell death and highlight the anti-cancer potential of conjugated PUFAs.","Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an essential component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC). Decreased skeletal muscle CoQ10 content may result in decreased ETC activity and energy production. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that prolonged supplementation with oral CoQ10 will increase plasma CoQ10 concentrations and skeletal muscle CoQ10 content in young, healthy untrained Thoroughbreds. Nineteen Thoroughbreds (27.5\u00b19.7 months old; 11 males, 8 females) from one farm and maintained on a grass pasture with one grain meal per day were supplemented orally once per day for 9 weeks with 1.5 mg/kg body weight of a CoQ10-\u03b2-cyclodextrin inclusion complex. Whole-blood and skeletal muscle biopsies were collected before (T0) and after (T1) 9 weeks of supplementation. Plasma CoQ10 concentrations were determined via high-performance liquid chromatography. Skeletal muscle mitochondrial ETC combined complex I+III enzyme activity (an indirect measurement of CoQ10 content) was assessed spectrophotometrically and normalised to mitochondrial abundance. Results were analysed using a paired two-tailed Students t-test with P\u22640.05 significant. Horses accepted supplementation with no adverse effects. The mean change in plasma CoQ10 concentration from T0 to T1 was significantly greater than zero (0.13\u00b10.02 vs. 0.25\u00b10.03 \u00b5g/ml, mean difference 0.12\u00b10.03; P=0.004), although variability in absorbance resulted in only a 58% response rate. The mean change in skeletal muscle complex I+III activity from T0 to T1 was significantly greater than zero (0.36\u00b10.04 vs. 0.59\u00b10.05 pmol/min/mg of muscle, mean difference 0.23\u00b10.05; P=0.0004), although T1 values for 3/19 horses decreased on average by 23% below T0 values. In conclusion, prolonged oral supplementation of the diet of young, healthy untrained Thoroughbreds with CoQ10 increased mean plasma CoQ10 concentration by 99% and mean skeletal muscle complex I+III activity by 65% with variability in absorbance among horses. Additional research is warranted investigating training and exercise effects on skeletal muscle CoQ10 content in CoQ10 supplemented and un-supplemented Thoroughbreds.","Traditional drug design focus on specific target (s) expressed by cancer cells. However, cancer cells outsmart the interventions by activating survival pathways and/or downregulating cell death pathways. As the research in molecular biology of cancer grows exponentially, new methods of drug designs are needed to target multiple pathways/targets which are involved in survival of cancer cells. Vitamin E analogues including a-tocopheryl succinate (\u03b1-TOS) is a well-known anti-tumoregenic agent which is well studied both in vitro and in vivo tumor models. However, lack of targeting cancer cells and unexpected toxicity along with the poor water solubility of \u03b1-TOS compelled a rational drug design using both targeting and cleavable technologies incorporated in the new drug design. A plethora of Vitamin E derivatives (AMP-001, 002 and 003) were synthesized, characterized and studied for the improved efficacy and lowered toxicity in various cancer cells in vitro. Preliminary studies revealed AAAPT leading candidates reduced the invasive potential of brain tumor stem cells, synergized with different drugs and different treatments. AAAPT leading drug AMP-001 enhanced the therapeutic index of front-line drug Doxorubicin in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) tumor rat model preserving the ventricular function when used as a neoadjuvant to Doxorubicin. These results may pave the way for reducing the cardiotoxicity of chemotherapy in clinical settings.","NutramilTM Complex is a multicomponent food product that meets the requirements of a food for special medical purpose. As a complete, high-energy diet it consists of properly balanced nutrients, vitamins and minerals. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of NutramilTM Complex on breast and prostate carcinoma cells. Our results showed that NutramilTM Complex reduced the viability and proliferation of breast and prostate cancer cells and that this process was associated with the induction of apoptosis via activation of caspase signalling. Data showed elevated levels of p53 tumour suppressor, up-regulation of p38 MAPK and SAPK / JNK proteins and downregulation of anti-apoptotic ERK1/2, AKT1 and HSP27. Treatment with NutramilTM Complex also affected the expression of the BCL2 family genes. Results also showed down-regulation of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 and up-regulation of pro-apoptotic members such as BAX, BAD, BID. In addition, we also observed regulation of many other genes, including Ikba, Chk1 and Chk2, associated with apoptotic events. Taken together, our results suggest activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway as most likely mechanism of anti-carcinogenic activity of NutramilTM Complex. ","In the last years, there has been extremely much information which reveals an alarming increase of obesity in children and, at the same time, an increase of the incidence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD implies a wide range of affections starting from simple hepatic steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH); the latter can evolve to cirrhosis and hepatic carcinoma. All these affections were noticed in children, too. The article presents data on the epidemiology, pathogeny, clinical and paraclinical findings, and treatment of NAFLD in children. ","Predictive coding suggests that the brain infers the causes of its sensations by combining sensory evidence with internal predictions based on available prior knowledge. However, the neurophysiological correlates of (pre-)activated prior knowledge serving these predictions are still unknown. Based on the idea that such pre-activated prior knowledge must be maintained until needed we measured the amount of maintained information in neural signals via the active information storage (AIS) measure. AIS was calculated on whole-brain beamformer-reconstructed source time-courses from magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings of 52 human subjects during the baseline of a Mooney face/house detection task. Pre-activation of prior knowledge for faces showed as alpha- and beta-band related AIS increases in content specific areas; these AIS increases were behaviourally relevant in brain area FFA. Further, AIS allowed decoding of the cued category on a trial-by-trial basis. Moreover, top-down transfer of predictions estimated by transfer entropy was associated with beta frequencies. Our results support accounts that activated prior knowledge and the corresponding predictions are signalled in low-frequency activity (&lt;30 Hz).","Megalin/LRP2 is a receptor that plays important roles in the physiology of several organs, such as kidney, lung, intestine, and gallbladder; and also in the physiology of the nervous system. Megalin expression is reduced in diseases associated with fibrosis, including diabetic nephropathy, hepatic fibrosis and cholelithiasis, as well as in some breast and prostate cancers. One of the hallmarks of these conditions is the presence of the cytokine transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u00df). Although TGF-\u00df has been implicated in the reduction of megalin levels, the molecular mechanism underlying this regulation is not well understood. Here, we show that treatment of two epithelial cell lines (from kidney and gallbladder) with TGF-\u00df1 is associated with decreased megalin mRNA and protein levels, and that these effects are reversed by inhibiting the TGF-\u00df1 type I receptor (TGF-\u00dfRI). Based on in silico analyses, the two SMAD-binding elements (SBEs) in the megalin promoter are located at positions \u221257 and \u2212605. Site-directed mutagenesis of the SBEs and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments revealed that SMAD2/3 transcription factors interact with SBEs to repress the megalin promoter and that they are also required for the repressing role of TGF-\u00df1. In addition, high concentration of albumin reduced megalin expression and promoter activation that depend on the expression of SMAD2/3. Interestingly, the histone deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA), which induces megalin expression, reduced the effects of TGF-\u00df1on megalin mRNA levels. These data show the significance of TGF-\u00df and the SMAD2/3 signalling pathway in the regulation of megalin and explain the decreased megalin levels observed under conditions in which TGF-\u00df is upregulated, including fibrosis-associated diseases and cancer.","Prior knowledge of perturbation data can significantly assist in inferring the relationship between chemical perturbations and their specific transcriptional response. However, current databases mostly contain cancer cell lines, which are unsuitable for the aforementioned inference in non-cancer cells. Here we present ChemPert (https://chempert.uni.lu/), a database consisting of 82270 transcriptional signatures across 167 non-cancer cell types, enabling more accurate predictions of perturbation responses and drugs compared to cancer databases in non-cancer cells. In particular, ChemPert correctly predicted drug effects for treating non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and novel drugs for osteoarthritis. Overall, ChemPert provides a valuable resource for drug discovery in non-cancer diseases.","Mitochondrial dysfunction due to respiratory chain impairment is a key feature in pathogenesis of Friedreich ataxia. Friedreich ataxia affects the nervous system, heart and pancreas. We assessed hepatic mitochondrial function by 13C-methionine-breath-test in 16 Friedreich ataxia patients and matched healthy controls. Patients exhaled significantly smaller amounts of 13CO2 over 90 minutes. Maximal exhaled percentage dose of 13CO2 recovery was reduced compared to controls. 13C-methionine-breath-test indicates subclinical hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction in Friedreich ataxia but did not correlate with GAA repeat lengths, disease duration or disease severity.","Among the features of cisplatin chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy are chronic pain and innocuous mechanical hypersensitivity. The complete etiology of the latter remains unknown. Here, we show that cisplatin targets a heterogeneous population of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive (TH+) primary afferent dorsal root ganglion neurons (DRGNs) within the primary afferent dorsal root ganglia in mice, determined using single-cell transcriptome and electrophysiological analyses. TH+ DRGNs regulate innocuous mechanical sensation through C-low threshold mechanoreceptors. A differential assessment of wild-type and vitamin E deficient TH+ DRGNs revealed heterogeneity and specific functional phenotypes. The TH+ DRGNs comprise; fast-adapting eliciting one action potential (AP; 1-AP), moderately-adapting (\u2265 2-APs), in responses to square-pulse current injection, and spontaneously firing (SF). Cisplatin increased the input resistance and AP frequency but reduced the temporal coding feature of 1-AP and \u2265 2-APs neurons. By contrast, cisplatin has no measurable effect on the SF neurons. Vitamin E reduced the cisplatin-mediated increased excitability, but did not improve the TH+ neuron temporal coding properties. Cisplatin mediates its effect by targeting outward K+ current, likely carried by through K2P18.1 (Kcnk18), discovered through the differential transcriptome studies and heterologous expression. Studies show a potential new cellular target for chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy and implicate the possible neuroprotective effects of vitamin E in cisplatin chemotherapy.","Non-invasive human electroencephalography (EEG) coupled with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is currently used to measure coarse stimulus-response relationships in brain physiology during behavior. However, with key modifications, the TMS-EEG technique holds even greater promise for monitoring fine-scale neural signatures of human behavior. Here, we demonstrate that a novel TMS-EEG co-registration technique can dynamically monitor individual human variation in perception based solely on EEG resting-state intrinsic effective connectivity probed by TMS-based phase resetting of ongoing activity. We used a bistable stimulus task, where the percept is perceived as either horizontal or vertical apparent motion, to record gamma band interhemispheric integration of information. Fine-grained inter-individual behavioral differences in horizontal motion bias could be measured by tracking resting-state gamma-band effective connectivity from right hMT+ to left hMT+. Thus, our method of triggering intrinsic resting-state effective connectivity in oscillatory dynamics can monitor individual differences in perception via the long-range integration of information. This technique will be useful for the manipulative dissection of individual-scale human cognition mediated by neural dynamics and may also expand neurofeedback approaches.","The contributions of skeletal cells to the processes of B cell development in the bone marrow (BM) have not been completely described. The von-Hippel Lindau protein (VHL) plays a key role in cellular responses to hypoxia. Previous work showed that Dmp1-Cre;Vhl conditional knockout mice (VhlcKO), which delete Vhl in late osteoblasts and osteocytes, display dysregulated bone growth and reduction in B cells. Here, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the B cell defects using flow cytometry and high-resolution imaging. In the VhlcKO BM, B cell progenitors were increased in frequency and number, whereas Hardy Fractions B-F were decreased. VhlcKO Fractions B-C cells showed increased apoptosis and quiescence. Reciprocal BM chimeras confirmed a B cell-extrinsic source of the VhlcKO B cell defects. In support of this, VhlcKO BM serum contained reduced CXCL12 and elevated EPO levels. Staining of VhlcKO B cells with an intracellular hypoxic marker indicated the natural existence of distinct B cell microenvironments that differ in local oxygen tensions. Additionally, intravital and ex vivo imaging revealed VhlcKO BM blood vessels with increased diameter, frequency, volume, and a diminished blood-BM barrier. Our studies identify novel mechanisms linking altered bone homeostasis with drastic BM microenvironmental changes that dysregulate B cell development.","The mechanisms involved in the production of red carotenoid-based ornaments in vertebrates are still poorly understood. Those colours generated by red carotenoids often depend on the enzymatic production (ketolation) of these pigments from dietary yellow carotenoids. Recently, it has been proposed that this conversion takes place at the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM). This implies that carotenoid ketolation and cell respiration could share the same biochemical pathways. Such a link would favour the evolution of red ketocarotenoid-based ornaments as reliable indices of individual quality under a sexual selection scenario. We exposed captive male red crossbills (Loxia curvirostra Linnaeus) to two different synthetic antioxidants designed to penetrate into the IMM: a synthetic ubiquinone (mitoQ) and a superoxide dismutase mimetic (mitoTEMPO). MitoQ decreased the blood levels of substrate yellow carotenoids and tocopherol. This could be attributed to the characteristics of the mitoQ molecule, which can distort the IMM structure, increasing free radical (superoxide) production and, potentially, antioxidant consumption. Contrarily, mitoTEMPO-treated birds increased the plasma levels of the second most abundant red ketocarotenoid of red crossbills (i.e. canthaxanthin). MitoTEMPO also increased plumage redness and total ketocarotenoid concentration in feathers among those birds exhibiting a redder plumage at the beginning of the study, rising the plasma values of the main red pigment (3-hydroxyechinenone) in paler birds. The results as a whole support the involvement of the mitochondrial antioxidant machinery in carotenoid biotransformation. The fact that the initial plumage redness determined the effect of mitoTEMPO suggests that the mitochondrial-based mechanism is intimately linked to individual quality.","Among the reported probiotic Bacillus strains, B. subtilis C-3102 has the unique potential to improve feed uptake under stress conditions in the broilers, piglets, and cows. In this study, we sought to evaluate the protective effect of feed additive probiotic Bacillus subtilis C-3102 against Salmonella enterica infection of specific pathogen-free (SPF) chicks in floor pens in two experiments. In the experiment-1, the chicks in the control group (n=32) were fed a basal diet and those in the C-3102 group (n=32) were fed a basal diet supplemented with 1x106 CFU/g of feed for 28 days. On day 7 post-challenge with S. enterica, there was no significant change in the body weight between both the groups throughout the test period, whereas detection rates of S. enterica in the C-3102 group were significantly lower in the cecum and liver on days 21 and 14 post-challenge, respectively. In the experiment-2, minimum dosage of C-3102 cells required to protect Salmonella infection was evaluated using 3 dosages. Chicks were divided into four groups, fed with different dosages of C-3102 (1x106, 5x105, 3x105, and 0 CFU/g of feed), and challenged with S. enterica (2.8x108 CFU/chicken). S. enterica infection was completed within 7 days post- challenge and was almost excluded from the liver and spleen on day 21 post- challenge in the control group. Average values showed a trend for higher infection rates in the control group &gt;3x105&gt;5x105&gt;1x106 CFU/g on days 14 and 21 post-challenge. These results suggest that B. subtilis C-3102 supplementation has the potential to reduce S. enterica infection rates and/or to accelerate the exclusion of S. enterica from the chicks. ","L'interet porte aux effets physiopathologiques des derives actifs de l'oxygene (DAO) dans la fertilite masculine est de plus en plus important. Le spermatozoide humain est une cellule tres vulnerable au stress oxydant compte tenu de sa richesse en acides gras polyinsatures. L'importance des dommages oxydatifs dans les spermatozoides depend surtout de la capacite des fluides environnants a arreter la chaine de peroxydation lipidique membranaire. Les secretions des tractus genitaux masculins et feminins constituent des microenvironnements qui jouent un role determinant dans l'expression du pouvoir fecondant des spermatozoides via des echanges avec la membrane plasmique, et assurent une protection vis-a-vis d'un stress oxydant en maintenant l'equilibre de la balance prooxydants/antioxydants. Le desequilibre de cette balance dans l'epididyme ou dans le sperme ejacule, induit plusieurs dysfonctions spermatiques. En revanche, il existe de tres rares donnees concernant les consequences d'un stress oxydant au niveau du tractus genital feminin sur les caracteristiques spermatiques. Apres avoir aborde, sous forme d'une revue bibliographique, les modifications de la composition lipidique des spermatozoides au cours de leur maturation et les effets physiopathologiques des DAO sur les fonctions des spermatozoides humains, nous rapportons nos resultats concernant les modifications de la composition lipidique des spermatozoides humains apres migration dans le mucus cervical et l'influence de la qualite de ce dernier sur les caracteristiques des spermatozoides selectionnes apres migration. Nous avons demontre une baisse des lipides dans les spermatozoides humains apres migration dans le mucus cervical (vitamine E, cholesterol, phospholipides diacyles, sphingomyeline et plasmalogenes). Cette baisse, associee a un enrichissement lipidique concomitant des mucus cervicaux, est en faveur d'un efflux actif des lipides membranaires des spermatozoides vers les glycoproteines des mucus cervicaux. Par ailleurs, lorsque les mucus cervicaux contenaient des polynucleaires neutrrophiles (PNN), les taux de phospholipides et la quantite de DAO produite par les spermatozoides etaient significativement plus eleves que lorsque les spermatozoides avaient migre dans des mucus cervicaux depourvus de PNN. L'infiltration des mucus cervicaux par les PNN joue un role possiblement deletere sur les structures et fonctions des spermatozoides et inhiberait l'interaction physiologique entre les spermatozoides et le mucus cervical.","Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has become one of the major tools for establishing the causal role of specific brain regions in perceptual, motor, and cognitive processes. Nevertheless, a persistent limitation of the technique is the lack of clarity regarding its precise effects on neural activity. Here, we examined the effects of TMS intensity and frequency on concurrently recorded blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals at the site of stimulation. In two experiments, we delivered TMS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in human subjects of both sexes. In Experiment 1, we delivered a series of pulses at high (100% of motor threshold) or low (50% of motor threshold) intensity, whereas in Experiment 2, we always used high intensity but delivered stimulation at four different frequencies (5, 8.33, 12.5, and 25 Hz). We found that the TMS intensity and frequency could be reliably decoded using multivariate analysis techniques even though TMS had no effect on overall BOLD activity at the site of stimulation in either experiment. These results provide important insight into the mechanisms through which TMS influences neural activity.","The ability of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum to access and utilise vital nutrients is critical to its growth and proliferation. Molecules that interfere with these process could potentially serve as antimalarials. We found that two riboflavin analogues, roseoflavin and 8-aminoriboflavin, inhibit malaria parasite proliferation by targeting riboflavin metabolism and/or the utilisation of the riboflavin metabolites flavin mononucleotide and flavin adenine dinucleotide. An additional eight riboflavin analogues were evaluated, but none were found to be more potent than roseoflavin, nor was their activity on target. Focussing on roseoflavin, we tested its antimalarial activity in vivo against Plasmodium vinckei vinckei in mice. We found that roseoflavin decreased the parasitemia by 46-fold following a 4 day suppression test and, on average, increased the survival of mice by 4-5 days. Our data are consistent with riboflavin metabolism and/or the utilisation of riboflavin-derived cofactors being viable drug targets for the development of new antimalarials and that roseoflavin could serve as a potential starting point.","Imuno TF\u00ae is a nutritional supplement composed of isolated transfer factors (TF) from porcine spleen. It is composed of a specific mixture of molecules that impact functions of the biological systems, and historically is linked to the immune system regulation. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time its proteomic analysis, nutritional composition, and safety profile in terms of mutagenic potential and acute oral dose (LD50). The obtained analysis indicated the product is a complex set of oligo- and polypeptides constituted of 163 different peptides which can potentially act on multiple mechanisms on the immune system pathways. The chemical composition showed low fat and low sugar content, saturated fatty acids-free and the presence of 10 vitamins and 11 minerals. No mutagenic effect was observed, and the LD50 was 5,000 mg kg-1 body weight. This accounts for a safe product to be used by oral route, with potential benefits for the immune system.","Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by neuromuscular and neurological manifestations. It is caused by mutations in gene FXN, which results in loss of the mitochondrial protein frataxin. Endoplasmic Reticulum-mitochondria associated membranes (MAMs) are inter-organelle structures involved in the regulation of essential cellular processes, including lipid metabolism and calcium signaling. In the present study, we have analyzed in both, unicellular and multicellular models of FRDA, an analysis of calcium management and of integrity of MAMs. We observed that function of MAMs is compromised in our cellular model of FRDA, which was improved upon treatment with antioxidants. In agreement, promoting mitochondrial calcium uptake was sufficient to restore several defects caused by frataxin deficiency in Drosophila Melanogaster. Remarkably, our findings describe for the first time frataxin as a member of the protein network of MAMs, where interacts with two of the main proteins implicated in endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria communication. These results suggest a new role of frataxin, indicate that FRDA goes beyond mitochondrial defects and highlight MAMs as novel therapeutic candidates to improve patient\u2019s conditions.","Residents in training, medical students and other staff in surgical sector, emergency room (ER) and intensive care unit (ICU) or Burn Unit face a multitude of questions regarding burn care. Treatment of burns is not always straightforward. Furthermore, National and International guidelines differ from one region to another. On one hand, it is important to understand pathophysiology, classification of burns, surgical treatment, and the latest updates in burn science. On the other hand, the clinical situation for treating these cases needs clear guidelines to cover every single aspect during the treatment procedure. Thus, 10 questions have been organised and discussed in a step-by-step form in order to achieve the excellence of education and the optimal treatment of burn injuries in the first 24 hours. These 10 questions will clearly discuss referral criteria to the burn unit, primary and secondary survey, estimation of the total burned surface area (%TBSA) and the degree of burns as well as resuscitation process, routine interventions, laboratory tests, indications of Bronchoscopy and special considerations for Inhalation trauma, immediate consultations and referrals, emergency surgery and admission orders. Understanding and answering the 10 questions will not only cover the management process of Burns during the first 24 hours but also seems to be an interactive clear guide for education purpose. ","Alzheimer\u2019s disease is characterized by the presence in the brain of amyloid plaques formed by the aberrant deposition of the amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2). Since many vitamins are dysregulated in this disease, we explored whether these molecules participate in protein homeostasis by modulating A\u03b2 aggregation. By screening 18 fat-soluble and water-soluble vitamins, we found that retinoic acid and \u03b1-tocopherol, two metabolites of vitamin A and vitamin E, respectively, affect A\u03b2 aggregation both in vitro and in a C. elegans model of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. We also show that effects of these two vitamin metabolites in combination can cancel each other out, suggesting that the complex composition of the cellular environment could have a protective role against protein aggregation through the simultaneous presence of aggregation promoters and inhibitors. Taken together, these results indicate that vitamins and their metabolites may be added to the list of components of the quality control system that regulate protein aggregation.","The early observations by Dr Otto Warburg revealed that fundamentally metabolic differences exist between malignant tumor cells and adjacent normal cells. Many studies have further reported the relationship between altered cellular metabolism and therapeutic outcomes. These observations suggest that targeting the peculiar metabolic pathways in cancer might be an effective strategy for cancer therapy. In recent years, investigations have accelerated into how altered cellular metabolism promotes tumor survival and growth. This review highlights the current concepts of altered metabolism in cancer and the molecular targets involved in glycolysis, mitochondria and glutamine metabolism and discusses future perspective of cellular metabolism-based cancer treatment. ","Background Almonds are a healthy tree nut food with high nutrient density. Their consumption has been shown to ameliorate oxidative stress, inflammation, etc. The objective of the study was to examine the effect of almonds on elements of endurance exercise performance in trained athletes. Methods A 10-week crossover, placebo controlled study was conducted. Eight trained male cyclists and two triathletes were randomly assigned to consume 75 g/d whole almonds (ALM) or isocaloric cookies (COK) with equal subject number. They consumed the assigned food for 4 wks and then the alternate food for another 4 wks. They underwent 3 performance tests including 125-min steady status exercise (SS) and 20-min time trial (TT) on an indoor stationary trainer at the start of the study (BL) and at the end of each intervention phase. Venous blood was collected in the morning prior to the performance test for biochemical measurements and finger blood during the test for glucose determination. Carbohydrate and fat oxidation, energy expenditure, and oxygen use were calculated using respiratory gas analysis. Results ALM increased cycling distance during TT by 1.7 km as compared BL (21.9 vs. 20.2 km, P = 0.053) and COK increased 0.6 km (20.8 vs. 20.2 km, P &gt; 0.05). ALM, but not COK, led to higher CHO and lower fat oxidation and less oxygen consumption during TT than BL (P &lt; 0.05), whereas there was no significant difference in heart rate among BL, ALM and COK. ALM maintained higher blood glucose level after TT than COK (P &lt; 0.05). ALM had higher vitamin E and haemoglobin and lower serum free fatty acid (P &lt; 0.05), slightly elevated serum arginine and nitric oxide and plasma insulin (P &gt; 0.05) than BL, and a higher total antioxidant capacity than COK (P &lt; 0.05). Conclusions Whole almonds improved cycling distance and the elements related to endurance performance more than isocaloric cookies in trained athletes as some nutrients in almonds may contribute to CHO reservation and utilization and effective oxygen utilization. The results suggest that almonds can be incorporated into diets of those who undertake exercise training for performance improvement.","Background Complications of central nervous system (CNS) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) often lead to cognitive impairment and seriously affect the quality of life. However, there is no individualized disease model. Urinary epithelial cells (UECs) can be an ideal source for generating human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and progenitors, as they are easily accessible, non-invasive and universally available. Therefore, we intended to differentiate urine-derived hiPSCs into neuron (N), astrocyte (A) and microvascular endothelial cells (E) from a T2DM patient for future study its pathogenesis and precision medical treatment.","Nucleobase-Ascorbate Transporter (NAT) family includes ascorbic acid, nucleobases and uric acid transporters: with a broad evolutionary distribution. In vertebrates, four members have been previously recognized, the ascorbate transporters Slc23a1 and Slc3a2, the nucleobase transporter Slc23a4 and an orphan transporter Slc23a3. Using phylogenetic and synteny analysis, we identify a fifth member of the vertebrate slc23 complement (slc23a5), present in neopterygians (gars and teleosts) and amphibians, and clarify the evolutionary relationships between the novel gene and known slc23 genes. Further comparative analysis puts forward uric acid as the preferred substrate for Slc23a5. Gene expression quantification, using available transcriptomic data, suggests kidney and testis as major expression sites in Xenopus tropicalis (western clawed frog) and Danio rerio (zebrafish). Additional expression in brain was detected in D. rerio, while in the Neoteleostei Oryzias latipes (medaka) slc23a5 expression is restricted to brain. The biological relevance of the retention of an extra transporter in fish and amphibians is discussed.","Studies about formaldehyde (FA) published since the guideline of 0.1 mg/m3 by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2010 have been evaluated; critical effects were eye and nasal (portal-of-entry) irritation. Also, it was considered to prevent long-term effects, including all types of cancer. The majority of the recent toxicokinetic studies showed no exposure-dependent FA-DNA adducts outside the portal-of-entry area and FA-DNA adducts at distant sites were due to endogenously generated FA. The no-observed-adverse-effect level for sensory irritation was 0.5 ppm and recently reconfirmed in hypo- and hypersensitive individuals. Investigation of the relationship between FA exposure and asthma or other airway effects in children showed no convincing association. In rats, repeated exposures showed no point mutation in the p53 and K-Ras genes at &lt;=15 ppm neither increased cell proliferation, histopathological changes and changes in gene expression at 0.7 ppm. Repeated controlled exposures (0.5 ppm with peaks at 1 ppm) did not increase micronucleus formation in human buccal cells or nasal tissue (0.7 ppm) or in vivo genotoxicity in peripheral blood lymphocytes (0.7 ppm), but higher occupational exposures were associated with genotoxicity in buccal cells and cultivated peripheral blood lymphocytes. It is still valid that exposures not inducing nasal squamous cell carcinoma in rats will not induce nasopharyngeal cancer or lymphohematopoietic malignancies in humans. Reproductive and developmental toxicity are not considered relevant in the absence of sensory irritation. In conclusion, the WHO guideline has been strengthened. ","In dogs with heart failure, cell oxygenation and cellular metabolism do not work properly, leading to the production of a large amount of free radicals. In the organism, these free radicals are responsible of major cellular damages: this is oxidative stress. However, a suitable food intake plays an important role in limiting this phenomenon: on the one hand, the presence of essential fatty acids in the composition of membranes decreases sensitivity of cells to free radicals and constitutes a first protection against the oxidative stress; on the other hand, coenzyme Q10, vitamin E, and polyphenols are antioxidant molecules which can help cells to neutralize these free radicals.","In this systematic review, we will consider and debate studies that have explored the effects of o-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in three major, and somehow related, developmental psychiatric disorders: Autism, Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity disorder and Psychosis. The impact of o-3 PUFAs on clinical symptoms and, if possible, brain trajectory in children and adolescents suffering from these illnesses will be reviewed and discussed, considering the biological plausibility of the effects of omega-3 fatty acids, together with their potential perspectives in the field. Heterogeneity in study designs will be discussed in the light of differences in results and interpretation of studies carried out so far. ","Introduction Allergic rhinitis is a condition of high prevalence in the population and widely studied, with several treatments being consecrated for its control. Spirulina is a dietary supplement that modulates immune function, and has been shown to modulate the inflammatory response of allergic rhinitis.","The pathways of signaling molecules are important to understanding how signaling molecules regulate physiological function and also in predicting the pathological development which is important to therapeutic strategy, however the thorough knowledge of these pathways is still lack. In this paper, we used the big data concept to analyze the pathways of signaling molecules and categorize these molecules into five groups according to their origin and effect on the five organs of heart-spleen-lung-kidney-liver. Heart group includes IGF, Ang and Mg; spleen group includes ANP, aldosterone, retinoic acid and ghrelin; lung group includes FGF7, VEGF, ascorbic acid and HIF; kidney group includes calcitonin, PTHrP, Wnt and NO; and liver group includes EPO, renin, SOD, AKR and GSH. We found that each group of molecules have assisting effect on the other organ in the order of heart-spleen-lung-kidney-liver-heart, and have regulating effect on the other organ in the order of heart-lung-liver-spleen-kidney-heart. Moreover, the pathways of molecules of each group also follow these two arrangements, in which the pathways of molecules form a closed-loop that may lead to new therapeutic strategies.","Background Microglial inflammation may significantly contribute to the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. To examine the potential of Cudrania cochinchinensis to ameliorate amyloid b protein (Ab)-induced microglia activation, BV-2 microglial cell line, and the ramified microglia in the primary glial mixed cultured were employed. Results Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Interferon-g (IFN-g), fibrillary Ab (fAb), or oligomeric Ab (oAb) were used to activate microglia. LPS and IFN-g, but not Abs, activated BV-2 cells to produce nitric oxide through an increase in inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression without significant effects on cell viability of microglia. fAb, but not oAb, enhanced the IFN-g-stimulated nitric oxide production and iNOS expression. The ethanol/water extracts of Cudrania cochinchinensis (CC-EW) and the purified isolated components (i.e. CCA to CCF) effectively reduced the nitric oxide production and iNOS expression stimulated by IFN-g combined with fAb. On the other hand, oAb effectively activated the ramified microglia in mixed glial culture by observing the morphological alteration of the microglia from ramified to amoeboid. CC-EW and CCB effectively prohibit the Ab-mediated morphological change of microglia. Furthermore, CC-EW and CCB effectively decreased Ab deposition and remained Ab in the conditioned medium suggesting the effect of CC-EW and CCB on promoting Ab clearance. Results are expressed as mean +- S.D. and were analyzed by ANOVA with post-hoc multiple comparisons with a Bonferroni test. Conclusions The components of Cudrania cochinchinensis including CC-EW and CCB are potential for novel therapeutic intervention for Alzheimer's disease. ","","Impaired lung function is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Restrictive and obstructive lung disorders are a large contributor to decreased lung function, as well as the acute impact of infection. Measures of pulmonary function are heritable, and thus, we sought to utilise genomics to propose novel drug repurposing candidates which could improve respiratory outcomes. Lung function measures were found to be genetically correlated with metabolic and hormone traits which could be pharmacologically modulated, with a causal effect of increased fasting glucose on diminished lung function supported by latent causal variable models and Mendelian randomisation. We developed polygenic scores for lung function specifically within pathways with known drug targets to prioritise individuals who may benefit from particular drug repurposing opportunities, accompanied by transcriptome-wide association studies to identify drug-gene interactions with potential lung function increasing modes of action. These drug repurposing candidates were further considered relative to the host-viral interactome of three viruses with associated respiratory pathology (SARS-CoV2, influenza, and human adenovirus). We uncovered an enrichment amongst glycaemic pathways of human proteins which putatively interact with virally expressed SARS-CoV2 proteins, suggesting that antihyperglycaemic agents may have a positive effect both on lung function and SARS-CoV2 progression.","The major motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease do not occur until a majority of the dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain SNpc have already died. For this reason, it is critical to identify biomarkers that will allow for the identification of presymptomatic individuals. In this study, we examine the baseline expression of the antioxidant protein Glutathione S-transferase pi (GSTpi) in blood of PD and environmental and age-matched controls and compare it to GSTpi levels following exposure to 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), an agent that has been shown to induce oxidative stress. We find that 4 hours of exposure to MPP+, significant increases in GSTpi levels can be observed in the leukocytes of PD patients. No changes were seen in other blood components. This suggests that GSTpi and potentially other members of this and other anti-oxidant families may be viable biomarkers for PD. ","Background Intake, either as dietary components or as supplements, and blood concentrations of vitamin E, C, lycopene and carotenoids have been associated with a lower risk of incident (ischemic) stroke. However, causality cannot not be inferred from these associations. Here, we investigated causality by analyzing the associations between genetically-influenced antioxidant levels in blood and ischemic stroke using Mendelian Randomization (MR).","Wild relatives of tomato are a valuable source of natural variation in tomato breeding, as many can be hybridized to the cultivated species (Solanum lycopersicum). Several, including Solanum lycopersicoides, have been crossed to S. lycopersicum for the development of ordered introgression lines (ILs). Despite the utility of these wild relatives and their associated ILs, limited finished genomes have been produced to aid genetic and genomic studies. We have generated a chromosome-scale genome assembly for Solanum lycopersicoides LA2951 using PacBio sequencing, Illumina, and Hi-C. We identified 37,938 genes based on Illumina and Isoseq and compared gene function to the available cultivated tomato genome resources, in addition to mapping the boundaries of the S. lycopersicoides introgressions in a set of cv. VF36 x LA2951 introgression lines (IL). The genome sequence and IL map will support the development of S. lycopersicoides as a model for studying fruit nutrient/quality, pathogen resistance, and environmental stress tolerance traits that we have identified in the IL population and are known to exist in S. lycopersicoides.","The present study aimed to investigate the protective effect of \u03b2-carotene on the oxidative stress injury of human normal colon cell line CCD-18Co triggered by tert-Butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP). XTT examination was used to determine cell viability after \u03b2-carotene supplementation and to determine the optimal concentration of antioxidant in spectroscopic studies. Cell biochemistry for CCD-18Co control group, after tBHP adding and for cells in \u03b2-carotene - tBHP model was studied by using label-free Raman microspectroscopy. Results for stress treated CCD-18Co human colon normal cells and human colon cancer cells Caco-2 based on vibration features were also compared. Pretreatment with \u03b2-carotene alleviated damages in CCD-18Co human normal colon cells induced by tBHP and showed the preventative effect on cells apoptosis. Treatment with \u03b2-carotene altered the level of ROS investigated based on intensities of Raman peaks typical for lipids, proteins and nucleic acids. Presented study confirmed the antioxidant, protective role of \u03b2-carotene against ROS by using spectroscopic label-free Raman techniques.","Background Malaria parasites are very vulnerable to oxidative stress during the part of their life cycle when they inhabit the erythrocytes. Studies have shown that dietary intake of antioxidant plays a role in stabilizing oxidative stress.","Ovarian tissue cryopreservation and subsequent autologous transplantation has allowed resumption of endocrine function as well as fertility in certain populations. However, graft function is short-lived due to ischemia and aberrant follicular activation post-transplantation. While many studies have focused on gene expression, we wanted to determine whether cryopreservation itself had a deleterious effect on regulatory elements that might influence transcriptional integrity and graft performance. In this study, we used Omni-ATAC to assess genome-wide chromatin accessibility in primary human follicles before and after cryopreservation. Omni-ATAC from fresh ovarian follicles identified active regulatory elements expected to be functional in oocytes and granulosa cells, and gene ontology was consistent with RNA translation/processing and DNA repair. While promoter accessibility was largely maintained in cryopreserved ovarian follicles, we observed a widespread increase in the number of accessible enhancers. Transcription factor motif analysis and gene ontology suggested that this dysregulation was focused around the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Indeed, transcription factor binding was noted in major pathways involved in this transition: TGF-\u03b2 and Wnt signaling. Overall, our work provides the first genomic analysis of active regulatory elements in matched fresh and cryopreserved ovarian follicles as they undergo the process of ovarian tissue cryopreservation. Our data suggest that the process of cryopreservation activates an epithelial-mesenchymal transition state, which may lead to graft burn-out post-transplantation. Optimizing this technique in relation to this transition may therefore be an important step towards improving graft longevity and patient outcomes in fertility preservation.","The acclimation mechanism of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to nitric oxide (NO) was studied by exposure to S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), a NO donor. Treatment with 0.1 or 0.3 mM SNAP transiently inhibited photosynthesis within 1 h, followed by a recovery without growth impairment, while 1.0 mM SNAP treatment caused irreversible photosynthesis inhibition and mortality. The SNAP effects are avoided in the presence of the NO scavenger, 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-l-oxyl-3-oxide (cPTIO). RNA-seq, qPCR, and biochemical analyses were conducted to decode the metabolic shifts under sub-lethal NO stress by exposure to 0.3 mM SNAP in the presence or absence of 0.4 mM cPTIO. These findings revealed that the acclimation to NO stress comprises a temporally orchestrated implementation of metabolic processes: 1. trigger of NO scavenging elements to reduce NO level; 2. prevention of photo-oxidative risk through photosynthesis inhibition and antioxidant defense system induction; 3. acclimation to nitrogen and sulfur shortage; 4. degradation of damaged proteins through protein trafficking machinery (ubiquitin, SNARE, and autophagy) and molecular chaperone system for dynamic regulation of protein homeostasis. NO increased NADPH oxidase activity and respiratory burst oxidase-like 2 (RBOL2) transcript abundance, which were not observed in the rbol2 insertion mutant. Changes in gene expression in the rbol2 mutant and increased mortality under NO stress demonstrate that NADPH oxidase (RBOL2) is involved in the modulation of some acclimation processes (NO scavenging, antioxidant defense system, autophagy, and heat shock proteins) for Chlamydomonas to cope with NO stress. Our findings provide insight into the molecular events underlying acclimation mechanisms in Chlamydomonas to sub-lethal NO stress.","The vagina contains at least a billion microbial cells, which are dominated by Lactobacilli. Here we perform metagenomic shotgun sequencing on cervical samples from 1148 women. Factors such as pregnancy, delivery histories and breast-feeding were all more important than menstrual cycle in shaping the microbiome. Bifidobacterium breve was seen with older age at sexual debut; Lactobacillus crispatus negatively correlated with pregnancy history; potential markers for lack of menstrual regularity, heavy flow, dysmenorrhea, contraceptives were also identified. Other features such as mood fluctuations and facial speckles could potentially be deduced from the vagino-cervical microbiome. Gut and oral microbiome, plasma vitamins, metals, amino acids and hormones showed associations with the vagino-cervical microbiome. Our results offer an unprecedented glimpse into the microbiota of the female reproductive tract and call for international collaborations to better understand its long-term health impact.","Endometriosis is a common complex inflammatory condition characterised by the presence of endometrium-like tissue outside the uterus, mainly in the pelvic area. It is associated with chronic pelvic pain and infertility, and its pathogenesis remains poorly understood. The disease is typically classified according to the revised American Fertility Society (rAFS) 4-stage surgical assessment system, although stage does not correlate well with symptomatology or prognosis. Previously identified genetic variants mainly are associated with stage III/IV disease, highlighting the need for further phenotype-stratified analysis that requires larger datasets. We conducted a meta-analysis of 15 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and a replication analysis, including 58,115 cases and 733,480 controls in total, and sub-phenotype analyses of stage I/II, stage III/IV and infertility-associated endometriosis cases. This revealed 27 genetic loci associated with endometriosis at the genome-wide p-value threshold (P&lt;5\u00d710\u22128), 13 of which are novel and an additional 8 novel genes identified from gene-based association analyses. Of the 27 loci, 21 (78%) had greater effect sizes in stage III/IV disease compared to stage I/II, 1 (4%) had greater effect size in stage I/II compared to stage III/IV and 17 (63%) had greater effect sizes when restricted to infertility-associated endometriosis cases compared to overall endometriosis. These results suggest that specific variants may confer risk for different sub-types of endometriosis through distinct pathways. Analyses of genetic variants underlying different pain symptoms reported in the UK Biobank showed that 7/9 had positive significant (p&lt;1.28\u00d7103) positive genetic correlations with endometriosis, suggesting a genetic basis for sensitivity to pain in general. Additional conditions with significant positive genetic correlations with endometriosis included uterine fibroids, excessive and irregular menstrual bleeding, osteoarthritis, diabetes as well as menstrual cycle length and age at menarche. These results provide a basis for fine-mapping of the causal variants at these 27 loci, and for functional follow-up to understand their contribution to endometriosis and its potential subtypes.","Several studies have demonstrated that the use of natural preservatives through animal diets could increase the shelf life of meat and meat products since many plant-derived substances show antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. The aim of this work was to study the effect of olive cake dietary supplementation on beef oxidative stability and antimicrobial activity during storage. Beef cattle were randomly divided into three homogeneous groups that were assigned to one of the three diets: a commercial unified based diet administered for 90 days until slaughter (CTR), CTR diet supplemented with 0.5% olive cake administered for 90 days until slaughter (OC1), and CTR diet supplemented with 0.5% olive cake and administered for 60 days followed by the administration of the CTR diet for 30 days until slaughter (OC2). Beefsteaks were overwrapped with oxygen-permeable packaging and analysed at four different storage times (zero, three, six and nine days). At the four sampling times considered from all of the samples, total viable count (TVC), Enterobacteriaceae counts, colour coordinates (CIE L*a*b* colour system), peroxide value (PV), thiobarbituric reactive substances (TBARs) determinations and descriptive sensory analyses were performed. No differences in TVC and Enterobacteriaceae count were detected among the groups over all of the sampling times considered. Differences were recorder among groups for PV, TBARS, colour and sensory analysis. The addition of olive cake in the animal diet had an effect on lipid oxidation reducing the level of PV, TBARS and retarding colour deterioration and the development of off odour in OC meat during storage. ","Cells can help each other replicate by communicating with diffusible molecules. In cell cultures, molecules may diffuse within a cell colony or between adjacent or distant colonies. Determining which cell helps which cell\u2019s replication is challenging. We developed a systematic approach, integrating modeling and experiments, for determining the length-scales of cell-cell communication (from microns to centimeters). With this approach, we discovered that differentiating murine ES cells, scattered across centimeters on a dish, communicate over millimeters to form one macroscopic entity that survives if and only if its centimeter-scale population-density is above a threshold value. Single-cell-level measurements, transcriptomics, and modeling revealed that this \u201cmacroscopic quorum sensing\u201d arises from differentiating ES cells secreting and sensing survival-promoting FGF4 that diffuses over millimeters and activates YAP1-induced survival mechanisms. Through the same mechanism, a lone macroscopic, but not microscopic, colony survives differentiation. Our work rigorously establishes that in vitro ES-cell differentiation relies on macroscopic cooperation.","Sustainable wheat production in drought prone areas can be achieved by developing resilient wheat varieties. In the present study, chemical mutagenesis was used to induce mutations in a cultivated wheat variety \u2018NN-Gandum-1\u2019. In total, 44 mutants were selected based on their high yield potential for exposing to well-watered (W1) and rainfed (W2) conditions for one season. Then 24 mutants were selected, and were exposed to W1 and W2 regimes. On the basis of least relative reduction in physiological parameters under W2 regime, five mutants were selected for conducting exome capturing assays. In total, 184 SNPs were identified in nine genes (ABC transporter type 1, Aspartic peptidase, Cytochrome P450, transmembrane domain, Heavy metal-associated domain, HMA, NAC domain, NAD (P)-binding domain, S-type anion channel, Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 and UDP-glucuronosyl/UDP-glucosyltransferase). Maximum number of mutations were observed in chr.2D, which contained mutations in three genes i.e. ABC transporter type 1, NAD (P)-binding domain and UDP-glucuronosyl/UDP-glucosyltransferase which may have a role in conferring drought tolerance. The selected mutants were further tested for studying their biochemical responses under both the regimes for two years. The extent of membrane damage was estimated through malondialdehydeand hydrogen per oxidase and tolerance to drought stress was assessed via antioxidant enzymes in leaves. The selected mutants under drought stress increased the accumulation of proline content, total soluble sugars, total free amino acids, while decreased total chlorophyll content, carotenoids and total soluble protein. Finally, the procedure of narrowing down the number of developed mutants from a large mutation population (&gt;4000) is found useful for exploring the complex trait like drought without compromising yield potential. These mutants can further be explored to understand the genetic circuits of drought tolerance in wheat which will pave the way towards improving livelihood of resource poor farming community mostly relying on cereal food.","We report the results of a three-year precision medicine study that enrolled 1190 presumed healthy participants at a single research clinic. To enable a better assessment of disease risk and improve diagnosis, a precision health platform that integrates non-invasive functional measurements and clinical tests combined with whole genome sequencing (WGS) was developed. The platform included WGS, comprehensive quantitative non-contrast whole body (WB) and brain magnetic resonance imaging/angiography (MRI/MRA), computed tomography (CT) coronary artery calcium scoring, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, continuous cardiac monitoring, clinical laboratory tests, and metabolomics. In our cohort, 24.3% had medically significant genetic findings (MSF) which may contribute to increased risk of disease. A total of 206 unique medically significant variants in 111 genes were identified, and forty individuals (3.4%) had more than one MSF. Phenotypic testing revealed: 34.2% of our cohort had a metabolomics profile suggestive of insulin resistance, 29.2% had elevated liver fat identified by MRI, 16.4% had clinically important cardiac structure or cardiac function abnormalities on cardiac MRI or ECHO, 8.8% had a high cardiovascular risk on CT coronary artery calcium scoring (Agatston calcium score &gt; 400, Relative Risk of 7.2), 8.0% had arrhythmia found on continuous rhythm monitoring, 6.5% had cardiac conduction disorders found on EKG, 2% had previously undetected tumors detected by WB MRI, and 2.5% had previously undetected aneurysms detected by non-contrast MRI/MRA. Using family histories, personal histories, and test results, clinical and phenotypic findings were correlated with genomic findings in 130 study participants (63.1%) with high to moderate penetrance variants, suggesting the precision health platform improves the diagnostic process in asymptomatic individuals who were at risk. Cardiovascular and endocrine diseases achieved considerable clinical associations between MSFs and clinical phenotypes (89% and 72%, respectively). These findings demonstrate the value of integrating WGS and noninvasive clinical assessments for a rapid and integrated point-of-care clinical diagnosis of age-related diseases that contribute to premature mortality.","Mexicans and Mexican Americans share culture, genetic background, and predisposition for chronic complications associated with obesity and diabetes making imperative efficacious treatments and prevention. Obesity has been treated for centuries focused-on weight loss while other treatments on associated conditions like gout, diabetes (T2D), and hypertriglyceridemia. To date, there is no systematic review that synthetize the origin of obesity clinics in Mexico and the efforts to investigate treatments for obesity tested by randomized clinical trials (RCT).","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), whose main risk factor is cigarette smoking (CS), is one of the most common diseases globally. Many COPD patients also develop pulmonary hypertension (PH), a severe complication that leads to premature death. Evidence suggests reactive oxygen species (ROS) involvement in COPD and PH, especially regarding pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMC) dysfunction. However, the effects of CS on the pulmonary vasculature are not completely understood. Herein we provide evidence on the effects of CS extract (CSE) exposure on PASMC regarding ROS production, antioxidant response and its consequences on vascular tone dysregulation. Our results indicate that CSE exposure promotes mitochondrial fission, mitochondrial membrane depolarization and increased mitochondrial superoxide levels. However, the increase in superoxide did not parallel a counterbalancing antioxidant response in human pulmonary artery (PA) cells. Interestingly, the mitochondrial superoxide chelator mitoTEMPO reduced mitochondrial fission and membrane potential depolarization caused by CSE. As we have previously shown, CSE reduces PA vasoconstriction and vasodilation. In this respect, mitoTEMPO prevented the impaired nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation, while vasoconstriction remained reduced. Finally, we observed a CSE-driven downregulation of the Cyb5R3 enzyme, which prevents soluble guanylyl cyclase oxidation in PASMC. This might explain the CSE-mediated decrease in PA vasodilation. These results provide evidence that there might be a connection between mitochondrial ROS and altered vasodilation responses in PH secondary to COPD, and strongly support the potential of antioxidant strategies specifically targeting mitochondria as a new therapy for these diseases.","","ABSTRACT Autophagy is a homeostatic degradation process that is involved in tumordevelopment and normal development. Autophagy is induced in cancer cells inresponse to chemotherapeutic agents, and inhibition of autophagy results inenhanced cancer cell death or survival. Chloroquine (CQ), an anti-malarial drug,is a lysosomotropic agent and is currently used as a potential anticancer agentas well as an autophagy inhibitor. Here, we evaluate the characteristics ofthese dual activities of CQ using human colorectal cancer cell line HCT15. Theresults show that CQ inhibited cell viability in dose-and time-dependent mannerin the range between 20 to 80 uM, while CQ did not show any antiproliferativeactivity at 5 and 10 uM. Cotreatment of CQ with antitumor agent NVP-BEZ235, adual inhibitor of PI3K/mTOR, rescued the cell viability at low concentrationsmeaning that CQ acted as an autophagy inhibitor, but CQ induced the lethaleffect at high concentrations. Acridine orange staining revealed that CQ at highdoses induced lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP). High doses of CQproduced cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cotreatment of antioxidants,such as NAC and trolox, with high doses of CQ rescued the cell viability. Theseresults suggest that CQ may exert its dual activities, as autophagy inhibitor orLMP inducer, in concentration-dependent manner. ","Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an increasingly prevalent disease that is associated with multiple metabolic disturbances, yet the metabolic pathways underlying its progression are poorly understood. Here we studied metabolic pathways of the human liver across the full histological spectrum of NAFLD. We analyzed whole liver tissue transcriptomics and serum metabolomics data obtained from a large, prospectively enrolled cohort of 206 histologically characterized patients derived from the European NAFLD Registry and developed genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) of human hepatocytes at different stages of NAFLD. We identified several metabolic signatures in the liver and blood of these patients, specifically highlighting the alteration of vitamins (A, E) and glycosphingolipids, and their link with complex glycosaminoglycans in advanced fibrosis. Furthermore, we derived GEMs and identified metabolic signatures of three common NAFLD-associated gene variants (PNPLA3, TM6SF2 and HSD17B13). The study demonstrates dysregulated liver metabolic pathways which may contribute to the progression of NAFLD.","Id proteins are helix-loop-helix (HLH) transcriptional regulators frequently overexpressed in cancer. Id proteins inhibit basic HLH transcription factors through protein-protein interactions, often inhibiting differentiation and sustaining proliferation. We recently identified a small-molecule, AGX51, which targets Id proteins for degradation and impairs ocular neovascularization in mouse models. Here we show that AGX51 treatment of cancer cell lines impaired cell growth and viability that results from a dramatic increase in ROS production upon Id degradation. In mouse models, AGX51 treatment suppressed breast cancer colonization in the lung, regressed the growth of paclitaxel-resistant breast tumors when combined with paclitaxel and reduced tumor burden in a model of sporadic colorectal neoplasia. Furthermore, in cells and mice, we failed to observe acquired resistance to AGX51 likely the result of the immutability of the binding pocket and efficient degradation of the Id proteins. Thus, AGX51 is a first-in-class compound that antagonizes Id proteins, shows strong anti-tumor effects and may be further developed for the management of multiple cancers.","Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) from freeze-dried biomass of Nannochloropsis oceanica microalgae resists ruminal biohydrogenation in vitro, but in vivo demonstration is needed. Therefore, the present study was designed to test the rumen protective effects of N. oceanica in lambs. Twenty-eight lambs were assigned to one of four diets: Control (C); and C diets supplemented with: 1.2% Nannochloropsis sp. oil (O); 12.3% spray-dried N. oceanica (SD); or 9.2% N. oceanica (FD), to achieve 3 g EPA /kg dry matter. Lambs were slaughtered after 3 weeks and digestive contents and ruminal wall samples were collected. EPA concentration in the rumen of lambs fed FD was about 50% higher than lambs fed SD or O diets. Nevertheless, the high levels of EPA in cecum and faeces of animals fed N. oceanica biomass, independently of the drying method, suggests that EPA was not completely released and absorbed in the small intestine. Furthermore, supplementation with EPA sources also affected the ruminal biohydrogenation of C18 fatty acids, mitigating the shift from the t10 biohydrogenation pathways to the t11 pathways compared to the Control diet. Overall, our results demonstrate that FD N. oceanica biomass is a natural rumen-protected source of EPA to ruminants. ","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal and rapidly progressing neurodegenerative disease that affects motor neurons. This disease is associated with oxidative stress especially in mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (mutSOD1) patients. However, less is known for the most prevalent sporadic ALS due to a lack of disease models. Here, we studied oxidative the stress profiles in lymphoblasts from ALS patients with mutSOD1 or unknown (undSOD1) mutations.","Purpose of review Hypertension is a multifactorial disorder involving perturbations of the vasculature, the kidney, and the central nervous system. Hypertension represents a major risk factor for stroke, myocardial infarction, and heart failure. Despite treatment with multiple drugs, 37% of hypertensive patients remain hypertensive, likely due to the mechanisms contributing to blood pressure elevation that are not affected by current treatments. This review focuses on recently described novel role of mitochondrial deacetylase Sirt3 in vascular dysfunction and hypertension. Recent findings In the past several years, we have shown that the mitochondria are dysfunctional in hypertension; however, the role of mitochondria in the pathogenesis of hypertension remains elusive. We recently showed that patients with essential hypertension have decreased levels of the mitochondrial deacetylase Sirt3 leading to hyperacetylation of mitochondrial proteins. There is likely a causative role. Indeed, genetic deletion of Sirt3 in mice promotes vascular dysfunction and hypertension. Sirt3 depletion promotes endothelial dysfunction, increases smooth muscle cell hypertrophy, instigates vascular inflammation, and induces age-dependent hypertension. Summary Sirt3 is critical for vascular cell homeostasis, however, multiple risk factors impair Sirt3 leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and vascular dysregulation which contribute to hypertension and end-organ injury. Targeting Sirt3 may represent novel therapeutic approach to improve treatment of vascular dysfunction and reduce hypertension. ","The high nutritional value of vegetables is well recognized, but their short shelf life and seasonal nature result in massive losses and wastes. Vegetable's byproducts are an opportunity to develop value-added ingredients, increasing food system efficiency and environmental sustainability. In the present work, pulps and powders of byproducts from rocket and spinach leaves and watercress were developed and stored for six months under freezing and vacuum conditions, respectively. After processing and storage, microbiological quality, bioactive compounds (polyphenols, carotenoids and tocopherols profiles), antioxidant capacity, and pulps viscosity were analyzed. Generally, the developed vegetable's pulps and powders were considered microbiologically safe. Although some variations after processing and storage were verified, the antioxidant activity was preserved or improved. A rich phenolic composition was also registered and maintained. During freezing, the quantitative carotenoid profile was significantly improved (mainly in rocket and spinach), while after drying, there was a significant decrease. A positive effect was verified in the vitamin E level. Both processing and storage conditions resulted in products with relevant phenolics, carotenoids and tocopherol levels, contributing to the antioxidant activity registered. Thus, this study demonstrates the potential of vegetable byproducts valorization through developing these functional ingredients bringing economic and environmental value into the food chain. ","Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is a neurological disease caused by the accumulation of extracellular senile plaques consisting of \u03b2-amyloid peptide (A\u03b2) in the brain. A transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans which demonstrated paralysis due to the expression of human beta amyloid A\u03b242 gene was used to study the anti-paralysis effect of mixed tocotrienols. The content of the mixed tocotrienols were 12.1% \u03b1-, 2.7% \u03b2-, 18.6% \u03b3-, and 8.1% \u03b4-tocotrienols. Mixed tocotrienols significantly delayed the A\u03b2-induced paralysis in the transgenic nematode and exhibited anti-oxidant properties towards A\u03b2-generated oxidative stress. The mixture also presented potent inhibitory activities against A\u03b2 aggregation with an IC50 value of 600 ng/ml. It is concluded that mixed tocotrienols could potentially serve as a new therapeutic candidate for AD.","Introduction Event free survival rates at 15 years for paediatric patients with relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) are 30-50%, with 5-year survival for adult patients only 20%. A large proportion of patients with newly diagnosed and relapsed ALL harbour somatic mutations that activate the RAS-signalling cascade. Steroids are a backbone of all induction blocks of ALL therapy, with preclinical data suggesting the combination of dexamethasone with the MEK1/2 inhibitor, selumetinib (ARRY-142886), results in a potent synergistic anti-cancer effect.","a-tocopherol is a powerful liposoluble antioxidant and the most abundant isoform of vitamin E in the body. Under normal physiological conditions, adverse effects of relatively high concentration of vitamin E on organisms and the underlying mechanisms are still largely unclear. In the present study, we used the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as an in vivo assay system to investigate the possible adverse effects of high concentration of vitamin E on thermosensation and thermotaxis learning and the underlying mechanisms. Our data show that treatment with 100-200 ug/mL of vitamin E did not noticeably influence both thermosensation and thermotaxis learning; however, treatment with 400 ug/mL of vitamin E altered both thermosensation and thermotaxis learning. The observed decrease in thermotaxis learning in 400 ug/mL of vitamin E treated nematodes might be partially due to the moderate but significant deficits in thermosensation, but not due to deficits in locomotion behavior or perception to food and starvation. Treatment with 400 ug/mL of vitamin E did not noticeably influence the morphology of GABAergic neurons, but significantly decreased fluorescent intensities of the cell bodies in AFD sensory neurons and AIY interneurons, required for thermosensation and thermotaxis learning control. Treatment with 400 ug/mL of vitamin E affected presynaptic function of neurons, but had no remarkable effects on postsynaptic function. Moreover, promotion of synaptic transmission by activating PKC-1 effectively retrieved deficits in both thermosensation and thermotaxis learning induced by 400 ug/mL of vitamin E. Therefore, relatively high concentrations of vitamin E administration may cause adverse effects on thermosensation and thermotaxis learning by inducing damage on the development of specific neurons and presynaptic function under normal physiological conditions in C. elegans. ","Neuroblastoma is the most common solid tumour in childhood and prognosis remains poor for high-risk cases despite the use of multimodal treatment. Analysis of public drug sensitivity data showed neuroblastoma lines to be particularly sensitive to indisulam, a molecular glue that selectively targets RNA splicing factor RBM39 for proteosomal degradation via DCAF15-E3-ubiquitin ligase. In neuroblastoma models, indisulam induced rapid loss of RBM39, accumulation of splicing errors and growth inhibition in a DCAF15- dependent manner. Integrative analysis of RNAseq and proteomics data highlighted a distinct disruption to cell cycle and metabolism. Metabolic profiling demonstrated metabolome perturbations and mitochondrial dysfunction resulting from indisulam. Complete tumour without relapse was observed in both xenografts and the Th-MYCN transgenic model of neuroblastoma after indisulam treatment, with RBM39 loss confirmed in vivo. Our data imply that dual targeting of metabolism and RNA splicing with anti-cancer sulphonamides such as indisulam is a promising therapeutic approach for high-risk neuroblastoma.","BACKGROUND Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is a global condition lacking effective treatment. Repeated magnetic transcranial stimulation (rTMS) may reduce craving and frequency of cocaine use, but little is known about its efficacy and neural effects.","Background Antouka Super(r) (AS), a combination of insecticide (Pirimiphos-methyl 16% and Permethrin 3%), is one of the most widely used pesticides in agriculture, public health, home and garden, with high potential for human and animal exposure. Objective The present study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of AS on the serum testosterone, oxidative stress biomarkers, testis histology and fertility of male Japanese quail. Methods Thirty-two (32) male Japanese quails twenty-eight (28) days were randomly divided into four groups: C0 (control), T1, T2 and T3, exposed daily (gavage) to 0, 37.5, 56.25 and 75 mg of AS/kg body weight (b.w), respectively, for 49 consecutive days and were analysed for fertility. Control and experimental male quails were cohabited, for two days, with untreated female quails and sperm positive female quail were analysed for paternal-mediated toxicity. After completion of fertility studies quails were sacrificed and analysed for reproductive endpoints. Results There was a dose dependent decrease of the relative weight of testis, epididymis and vas deferens. Additionally, testis total proteins and serum testosterone levels were decreased in AS treated quails (p &lt; 0.05). A decrease of sperm motility, viability and concentration per vas deferens, and an increase of sperm anomalies were recorded in AS exposed quails with respect to the controls. The embryonic and post-embryonic mortality rate were significantly (p &lt; 0.05) higher in group T3 (25.00 +- 3.40% and 31.66 +- 10.22% respectively) than in control group (6.25 +- 3.98% and 9.54 +- 3.72% respectively). The superoxide dismutase (SOD), total peroxidase (POD) and catalase activity (CAT) were significantly (p &lt; 0.05) lower treated than control quails, while the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) higher in groups T1, T2 and T3 (13.00 +- 0.96, 23.50 +- 1.35 and 29.08 +- 1.58 nmol/mg tissues respectively) compared to the control one (9.32 +- 0.67nmol/mg tissues). Histopathological examination of the testes of AS treated quails revealed testicular lesions characterized by moderate to severe degenerative changes of seminiferous tubules, incomplete spermatogenesis and depletion in the germ layers of seminiferous tubules in which immature spermatozoa were hardly seen. Conclusion From the above study, it can be inferred that AS (56.25 and 75) mg/kg b.w decrease body and relative organ weights and induces testicular lesions. Also, AS increases the level of MDA while it reduces the levels of enzymatic antioxidant biomarkers, serum testosterone and reproductive indices of intoxicated quails and their offspring. However, further work is needed to establish the genetic toxicology and immunohistochemistry of caspase-3 and claudin-1. ","Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the commonest cause of chronic liver disease worldwide, being nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) its most clinically relevant form. Given the risks associated with taking a liver biopsy, the design of accurate non-invasive methods to identify NASH patients is of upmost importance. BMP2 plays a key role in metabolic homeostasis; however, little is known about its involvement in NAFLD onset and progression. This study aimed to elucidate the impact of BMP2 in NAFLD pathophysiology. Hepatic and circulating levels of BMP2 were quantified in serum and liver specimens from 115 biopsy-proven NAFLD patients and 75 subjects with histologically normal liver (NL). In addition, BMP2 content and release was determined in cultured human hepatocytes upon palmitic acid (PA) overload. We found that BMP2 expression was abnormally increased in livers from NAFLD patients than in subjects with NL and this was reflected in higher serum BMP2 levels. Notably, we observed that PA upregulated BMP2 expression and secretion by human hepatocytes. An algorithm based on serum BMP2 levels and clinically relevant variables to NAFLD showed an AUROC of 0.886 (95%CI, 0.83\u20130.94) to discriminate NASH. We used this algorithm to develop SAN (Screening Algorithm for NASH): a SAN &lt; 0.2 implied a low risk and a SAN \u2265 0.6 indicated high risk of NASH diagnosis. This proof-of-concept study shows BMP2 as a new molecular target linked to NAFLD and introduces SAN as a simple and efficient algorithm to screen individuals at risk for NASH.","Background The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is an obesity-driven disorder with pandemic proportions and limited treatment options. Oxidative stress, low-grade inflammation and altered autonomic regulation, are important components of MetS pathophysiology. We recently reported that galantamine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and an FDA-approved drug (for Alzheimer\u2019s disease) alleviates the inflammatory state in MetS subjects. Here we examined the effects of galantamine on oxidative stress in parallel with inflammatory and cardio-metabolic parameters in subjects with MetS.","Background The stabilized prefusion form of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is produced by transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana. The trimeric spike glycoproteins are displayed at the surface of self-assembling Virus-Like-Particles that mimic the shape and the size of the virus. The candidate vaccine (CoVLP) administered alone or with AS03 or CpG1018 adjuvants was evaluated in a Phase 1 trial in healthy adults. (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT04450004)","Iodine has strong antimicrobial properties and has been used in topical applications as antiseptic. Its systemic use in form of iodine complexes derived from dried seaweed extract is beneficial in treating various disorders. Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) chronic infection is present in 6-10% of the Pakistani population and is a major healthcare burden that could benefit from innovative therapeutic regimens.","As the most common type of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is thought to be caused mainly by the excessive aggregation of \u03b2-amyloid protein (A\u03b2). However, a growing number of studies have found that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a key role in the onset and progression of AD. The present study aimed to probe the neuroprotective effect of high-frequency low-intensity pulsed electric field (H-LIPEF) for SH-SY5Y cells against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and A\u03b2-induced cytotoxicity. By looking in a systematic way into the frequency- and amplitude-dependent neuroprotective effect of pulsed electric field (PEF), the study finds that H-LIPEF at 200 Hz produces the optimal protective effect for SH-SY5Y cells. The underlying mechanisms were confirmed to be due to the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway and the downstream prosurvival and antioxidant proteins. Because the electric field can be modified to focus on specific area in a non-contact manner, the study suggests that H-LIPEF holds great potential for treating NDDs, whose effect can be further augmented with the administering of drugs or natural compounds at the same time.","One of the most important areas of medical science is oncology, which is responsible for both the diagnostics and treatment of cancer diseases. Over the years, there has been an intensive development of cancer diagnostics and treatment. This paper shows the comparison of normal (CCD-18Co) and cancerous (CaCo-2) cell lines of the human gastrointestinal tract on the basis of nanomechanical and biochemical properties in order to obtain information on the cancer biomarkers useful in oncological diagnostics. The research techniques used were: Atomic Force Microscopy and Raman spectroscopy and imaging. In addition, the studies included also the effect of the statins compounds: mevastatin, lovastatin and simvastatin and their influence on nanomechanical and biochemical changes of properties of cells tracking using AFM and Raman imaging techniques. The cytotoxicity of mevastatin and lovastatin was determined by using XTT tests.","Cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) has strong effects on neurogenesis and axon pathfinding in the prenatal brain. Endocannabinoids that activate CB1R are abundant in the early postnatal brain and in mother\u2019s milk, but few studies have investigated their function in newborns. We examined postnatal CB1R expression in the major striatonigral circuit from striosomes of the striatum to the dopamine-containing neurons of the substantia nigra. CB1R enrichment was first detectable between postnatal days 5 and 7, and this timing coincided with the formation of \u2018striosome-dendron bouquets\u2019, the elaborate anatomical structures by which striosomal neurons control dopaminergic cell activity through inhibitory synapses. In Cnr1\u2212/\u2212 knockouts lacking CB1R expression, striosome-dendron bouquets were markedly disorganized by postnatal day 11 and at adulthood, suggesting a postnatal pathfinding connectivity function for CB1R in connecting striosomal axons and dopaminergic neurons analogous to CB1R\u2019s prenatal function in other brain regions. Our finding that CB1R plays a major role in postnatal wiring of the striatonigral dopamine system, with lasting consequences at least in mice, points to a crucial need to determine whether lactating mothers\u2019 use of CB1R agonists (e.g., in marijuana) or antagonists (e.g., type 2 diabetes therapies) can disrupt brain development in nursing offspring.","Euglena gracilis is a well-studied biotechnologically exploitable phototrophic flagellate harbouring secondary green plastids. Here we describe its plastid proteome obtained by high-resolution proteomics. We identified 1,345 candidate plastid proteins and assigned functional annotations to 774 of them. More than 120 proteins are affiliated neither to the host lineage nor the plastid ancestor and may represent horizontal acquisitions from various algal and prokaryotic groups. Reconstruction of plastid metabolism confirms both the presence of previously studied/predicted enzymes/pathways and also provides direct evidence for unusual features of its metabolism including uncoupling of carotenoid and phytol metabolism, a limited role in amino acid metabolism and the presence of two sets of the SUF pathway for FeS cluster assembly. Most significantly, one of these was acquired by lateral gene transfer (LGT) from the chlamydiae. Plastidial paralogs of membrane trafficking-associated proteins likely mediating a poorly understood fusion of transport vesicles with the outermost plastid membrane were identified, as well as derlin-related proteins that potentially act as protein translocases of the middle membrane, supporting an extremely simplified TIC complex. The proposed innovations may be also linked to specific features of the transit peptide-like regions described here. Hence the Euglena plastid is demonstrated to be a product of several genomes and to combine novel and conserved metabolism and transport processes.","More than a decade of gut microbiome studies have a common goal for human health. As most of the disease studies sample the elderly or the middle-aged, a reference cohort for young individuals has been lacking. It is also not clear what other omics data need to be measured to better understand the gut microbiome. Here we present high-depth metagenomic shotgun sequencing data for the fecal microbiome together with other omics data in a cohort of 2,183 adults, and observe a number of vitamins, hormones, amino acids and trace elements to correlate with the gut microbiome and cluster with T cell receptors. Associations with physical fitness, sleeping habits and dairy consumption are identified in this large multi-omic cohort. Many of the associations are validated in an additional cohort of 1,404 individuals. Our comprehensive data are poised to advise future study designs to better understand and manage our gut microbiome both in population and in mechanistic investigations.","The poor outcome of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, is associated with systemic hyperinflammatory response and immunopathology. Although inflammasome and oxidative stress have independently been implicated in COVID-19, it is poorly understood whether these two pathways cooperatively contribute to disease severity. Herein, we found an enrichment of CD14highCD16- monocytes displaying inflammasome activation evidenced by caspase-1/ASC-speck formation in severe COVID-19 patients when compared to mild ones and healthy controls, respectively. Those cells also showed aberrant levels of mitochondrial superoxide (MitoSOX) and lipid peroxidation, both hallmarks of the oxidative stress response, which strongly correlated with caspase-1 activity. In addition, we found that NLRP3 inflammasome-derived IL-1\u03b2 secretion by SARS-CoV-2- exposed monocytes in vitro was partially dependent on lipid peroxidation. Importantly, altered inflammasome and stress responses persisted after short- term patient recovery. Collectively, our findings suggest oxidative stress/NLRP3 signaling pathway as a potential target for host-directed therapy to mitigate early COVID-19 hyperinflammation as well as its long-term outcomes.","Plastoglobules (PGs) are dynamic protein-lipid micro-compartments in plastids enriched for isoprenoid-derived metabolites. Chloroplast PGs support formation, remodeling and controlled dismantling of thylakoids during developmental transitions and environmental responses. However, the specific molecular functions of most PG proteins are still poorly understood. This study harnesses recent co-mRNA expression from ATTED-II using combined microarray and RNAseq information on an updated inventory of 34 PG proteins, as well as proteomics data across 30 Arabidopsis tissue types from ATHENA. Hierarchical clustering based on relative abundance for the PG proteins across non-photosynthetic and photosynthetic tissue types showed their coordinated protein accumulation across Arabidopsis parts, tissue types, development and senescence. We generated multiple mRNA-based networks by applying different coefficient thresholds; functional enrichment was determined for each network and PG gene. Combined analysis of these stringency networks identified a central hub and four peripheral modules. Enrichment of specific nuclear transcription factors (e.g. Golden2-like) and support for cross-talk between PGs and the plastid gene expression was observed, and specific ABC1 kinases seem part of a light signaling network. Examples of other specific findings are that FBN7b is involved with upstream steps of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis and that ABC1K9 is involved in starch metabolism.","Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are byproducts of aerobic metabolism and contribute to both physiological and pathological conditions as second messengers. ROS are essential for antigen specific activation of T cells, but little is known about what role ROS play in NKT cells. In the current study, we investigated the role of ROS in NKT cell function. We found that ROS levels are similar among CD4, CD8 and NKT cell subsets in the thymus. However, NKT cells, but neither CD4 nor CD8 T cells, showed dramatically increased ROS in the spleen and liver but not in adipose tissues. ROS in the peripheral NKT cells were primarily produced by NADPH oxidases not mitochondria. Accordingly, ROS-high NKT cells were susceptible to oxidative stress and underwent apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, ROS play an important role in regulating the inflammatory function of NKT cells because antioxidant treatment of NKT cells showed reduced frequencies of IFN-\u03b3+ and IL-17+ cells. In line with this, freshly isolated ROS-high NKT cells had more NKT1 and NKT17 cells but less NKT2 than ROS-low cells. These characteristics are regulated by promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) as evidenced by low ROS in NKT cells from PLZF haplodeficient mice and also from adipose tissues that do not express PLZF. Conversely, ROS were highly elevated in CD4 T cells from mice ectopically expressing PLZF. Together, our study revealed for the first time that ROS regulate NKT cell functions through PLZF.","Tropospheric ozone is a major air pollutant that significantly damages crop production around the world. Crop metabolic responses to rising chronic ozone stress have not been well-studied in the field, especially in C4 crops. In this study, we investigated the metabolomic profile of leaves from two diverse maize (Zea mays) inbred lines and the hybrid cross during exposure to season-long elevated ozone (~100 nL L\u22121) in the field using free air concentration enrichment (FACE) to identify key biochemical responses of maize to elevated ozone. Senescence, measured by loss of chlorophyll content, was accelerated in the hybrid line, B73 x Mo17, but not in either inbred line (B73 or Mo17). Untargeted metabolomic profiling further revealed that inbred and hybrid lines of maize differed in metabolic responses to ozone. A significant difference in the metabolite profile of hybrid leaves exposed to elevated ozone occurred as leaves aged, but no age-dependent difference in leaf metabolite profiles between ozone conditions was measured in the inbred lines. Phytosterols and \u03b1-tocopherol levels increased in B73 x Mo17 leaves as they aged, and to a significantly greater degree in elevated ozone stress. These metabolites are involved in membrane stabilization and chloroplast reactive oxygen species (ROS) quenching. The hybrid line also showed significant yield loss at elevated ozone, which the inbred lines did not. This suggests that the hybrid maize line was more sensitive to ozone exposure than the inbred lines, and up-regulated metabolic pathways to stabilize membranes and quench ROS in response to chronic ozone stress.","The ability of plants to cope with cold temperatures relies on their photosynthetic activity. This already demonstrates that the chloroplast is of utmost importance for cold acclimation and acquisition of freezing tolerance. During cold acclimation, the properties of the chloroplast change markedly. To provide the most comprehensive view of the protein repertoire of chloroplast envelope, we analysed this membrane system in Arabidopsis thaliana using MS-based proteomics. Profiling chloroplast envelope membranes was achieved by a cross comparison of protein intensities across plastid and the enriched membrane fraction both under normal and cold conditions. Multivariable logistic regression models the probabilities for the classification problem to address envelop localization. In total, we identified 38 envelope membrane intrinsic or associated proteins exhibiting altered abundance after cold acclimation. These proteins comprise several solute carries, such as the ATP/ADP antiporter NTT2 (substantially increased abundance) or the maltose exporter MEX1 (substantially decreased abundance). Remarkably, analysis of the frost recovery of ntt loss-of-function and mex1 overexpressor mutants confirmed that the comparative proteome is well suited to identify novel key factors involved in cold acclimation and acquisition of freezing tolerance. Moreover, for proteins with known physiological function we propose scenarios explaining their possible role in cold acclimation. Furthermore, spatial proteomics introduces a novel layer of complexity and enabled the identification of proteins differentially localized at the envelope membrane under the changing environmental regime.","As sessile organisms, plants are subjected to fluctuating sunlight including potentially detrimental ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B). In Arabidopsis thaliana, experiments under controlled conditions have shown that UV RESISTANCE LOCUS 8 (UVR8) controls photomorphogenic responses for acclimation and tolerance to UV-B; however, its long-term impacts on plant performance remain poorly understood in naturally fluctuating environments. Here we quantified the survival and reproduction of different Arabidopsis mutant genotypes in diverse field and laboratory conditions. We found that uvr8 mutants produced more fruits than wild type in growth chambers with artificial low UV-B conditions but not in natural field conditions. Importantly, independent double mutants of UVR8 and the blue-light photoreceptor gene CRYPTOCHROME 1 (CRY1) in two genetic backgrounds showed a drastic reduction in fitness in the field. UV-B attenuation experiments in field conditions and supplemental UV-B in growth chambers demonstrated that UV-B caused the conditional cry1 uvr8 lethality phenotype. RNA sequencing in different conditions revealed a large number of genes with statistical interaction of UVR8 and CRY1 mutations in the presence of UV-B in the field. Among them, Gene Ontology analysis identified enrichment of categories related to UV-B response, oxidative stress, photoprotection and DNA damage repair. Our study demonstrates the functional importance of the UVR8-mediated response across life stages in natura, which is partially redundant with CRY1, and provides an integral picture of gene expression associated with plant environmental responses under diverse environmental conditions.","Introduction Bile acids (BAs) are the end products of cholesterol metabolism produced by human and gut microbiome co-metabolism. Recent evidence suggests gut microbiota influence pathological features of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) including neuroinflammation and amyloid-\u03b2 deposition.","Gastrointestinal strongyles are a major threat to horses' health and welfare. Given that strongyles inhabit the same niche as the gut microbiota, they may interact with each other. These beneficial or detrimental interactions are unknown in horses and could partly explain contrasted susceptibility to infection between individuals. To address these questions, an experimental pasture trial with 20 worm-free female Welsh ponies (10 susceptible (S) and 10 resistant (R) to parasite infection) was implemented for five months. Fecal egg counts (FEC), hematological and biochemical data, body weight and gut microbiota composition were studied in each individual after 0, 24, 43, 92 and 132 grazing days.","Background Genome-scale metabolic models allow researchers to calculate yields, to predict consumption and production rates, and to study the effect of genetic modifications in silico, without running resource-intensive experiments. While these models have become an invaluable tool for optimizing industrial production hosts like E. coli and S. cerevisiae, few such models exist for one-carbon (C1) metabolizers.","The confirmed number of SARS-CoV-2 infections up to 30 August 2021 is 217 mil. worldwide but information about factors affecting the probability of infection or of a severe course of Covid-19 remains insufficient and often speculative. Only a small number of factors have been rigorously examined, mostly by retrospective or cross-sectional studies. We ran a preregistered study on 5,164 internet users who shared with us information about their exposure to 105 risk factors and reported being Covid negative before the beginning of the fourth wave of Covid-19 in the Czech Republic. After the fourth wave, in which 709 (13.7%) of participants were infected, we used a partial Kendall test controlled for sex, age, and urbanisation to compare the risk of infection and of a severe course of the disease in subjects who originally did and did not report exposure to particular risk factors. After the correction for multiple tests, we identified 13 factors \u2013 including male sex, lower age, blood group B, and the larger household size \u2013 that increased the risk of infection and 16 factors \u2013 including mask wearing, borreliosis in the past, use of vitamin D supplements, or rooibos drinking \u2013 that decreased it. We also identified 23 factors that increased the risk of a severe course of Covid-19 and 12 factors that decreased the risk.","Objectives Maternal nutrition plays a crucial role in influencing fetal growth and birth outcomes. The government of Indonesia has provided a manufactured fortified food supplementation program for undernourished pregnant mothers. We hypothesized a low-cost local food supplementation (LFS) would improve maternal and birth outcomes compared with government food supplementation (GFS).","Oxydemeton-methyl, is an organothiophosphate insecticide, which is widely used in agricultural and urban pest controls. It exists in the environment and a large amount bioaccumulation in the wildlife due to its strong water solubility and mobility. Although its potentially harmful effect on animals and humans, few studies have focused on the oxydemeton-methyl pollution in the environment. Zebrafish have been used for many years to valuate the pollution status of water and toxicity of chemicals. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effect of oxydemeton-methyl on the expression level of liver microsomal cytochrome P450, on the activity of NADPH-P450 reductase and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in zebrafish. Adult male and female zebrafish were treated with different concentration of oxydemeton-methyl (10, 50, 100 \u03bcM) for 5, 10, 20 and 30 days. We found that the oxydemeton-methyl exposure significantly increased the P450 levels and the activity of NAPDH-P450 reductase. ROS generation and the DNA damage were augmented in a dose-dependent manner in the zebrafish. These results indicated that oxydemeton-methyl is able to induce strong oxidative stress and hence highly toxic to the zebrafish.","Background Small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (SQ-LNS) have been shown to reduce the prevalence of anemia and iron deficiency among infants and young children, but effects on other micronutrients are less well known. Identifying subgroups who may experience greater benefits from SQ-LNS, or who are more likely to respond to the intervention, may facilitate the development of public health policies and programs.","7-ketocholesterol (KChol) is one of the most cytotoxic oxysterols found in the plasma membrane, and increased levels of KChol are associated with numerous pathologies. It is thought to induce apoptosis via inactivation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway \u2014 a pathway that depends on lipid-rafts as signaling platforms. By means of coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that KChol disrupts the liquid-liquid phase separation seen in an equimolar mixture of (dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine) DPPC, (dioleoylphosphatidylcholine) DOPC, and Cholesterol (Chol). This disruption occurs via two mechanisms: i) KChol adopts a wider range of orientations with the membrane, which disrupts the packing of neigh-boring lipids and ii) KChol has no preference for DPPC over DOPC, which is the main driving force for lateral demixing in DPPC/DOPC/Chol membranes. This provides a molecular description of the means by which KChol induces apoptosis, and illustrates that a single chemical substitution to cholesterol can have a profound impact on the lateral organization of lipid membranes.","Nigella sativa, Carica papaya and Boswellia sacra are medicinal plants in the commonly used in folkloric medicine due to the presence of its immense therapeutic properties. Fifty (50) female albino mice weighing between 15-22g were divided into five groups of 10 mice each. Animal in group 1 served as control group and were administered distilled water while animal in group 2 were given 2ml of cisplatin (orally). Animal in group 3-5 were given orally; 100 mg/kg (low dose), 200 mg/kg (medium dose) and 400 mg/kg (high dose) of triherbal preparation. The feeding regimens lasted for 28 days. After 28 days, mammary gland and blood samples were collected for haematological and antioxidant analysis. The triherbal formula decreased the GSH and MDA levels of mice treated with 100 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg doses compare to control. The measurement of total protein content, SOD and CAT increased in treated animals compared to control. However, RBC (Red Blood Cell) counts significantly decreased in the low, medium and high dose groups (0.95\u00b10.08, 6.57\u00b10.08 and 3.55\u00b10.55 x 106 cells/mm3 respectively) compared to control (7.34\u00b10.40) at P&lt;0.05. Also, significant decreases (P&lt;0.05) in the level of the total WBC (White Blood Cell) count, platelet count, PCV (Packed Cell Volume) and Hb (haemoglobin) concentration were observed. The decreases were dose dependent. The MCH (Mean Corpuscular Haemoglobin) and MCHC (Mean Corpuscular Haemoglobin Concentration) except MCV (Mean Corpuscular Volume) significantly decreased in treated group only. The triherbal formulation exhibited significant antioxidant activities showing increased levels of SOD, CAT and Protein content due to activation of the enzyme involve in detoxification of free radicals and decreased in the level of GSH and MDA due to accumulation of peroxides and H2O2. Also, decreased in haematological parameters due to the presence of phytochemicals such as phenol, resins, saponins, sterols, tannis and terpenes in the triherbal formula. Therefore, it has potential to induce haematotoxicity hence consumption of high concentrations should be discouraged.","Respiratory complex II (CII, succinate dehydrogenase, SDH) inhibition can induce cell death, but the mechanistic details need clarification. To elucidate the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation upon the ubiquinone-binding (Qp) site blockade, we substituted CII subunit C (SDHC) residues lining the Qp site by site-directed mutagenesis. Cell lines carrying these mutations were characterized on the bases of CII activity and exposed to Qp site inhibitors MitoVES, thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA) and Atpenin A5. We found that I56F and S68A SDHC variants, which support succinate-mediated respiration and maintain low intracellular succinate, were less efficiently inhibited by MitoVES than the wild-type (WT) variant. Importantly, associated ROS generation and cell death induction was also impaired, and cell death in the WT cells was malonate and catalase sensitive. In contrast, the S68A variant was much more susceptible to TTFA inhibition than the I56F variant or the WT CII, which was again reflected by enhanced ROS formation and increased malonate- and catalase-sensitive cell death induction. The R72C variant that accumulates intracellular succinate due to compromised CII activity was resistant to MitoVES and TTFA treatment and did not increase ROS, even though TTFA efficiently generated ROS at low succinate in mitochondria isolated from R72C cells. Similarly, the high-affinity Qp site inhibitor Atpenin A5 rapidly increased intracellular succinate in WT cells but did not induce ROS or cell death, unlike MitoVES and TTFA that upregulated succinate only moderately. These results demonstrate that cell death initiation upon CII inhibition depends on ROS and that the extent of cell death correlates with the potency of inhibition at the Qp site unless intracellular succinate is high. In addition, this validates the Qp site of CII as a target for cell death induction with relevance to cancer therapy.","Background and objectives White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are frequent imaging features of small vessel disease (SVD) and related to poor clinical outcomes. WMH progression over time is well described, but regression was also noted recently, although the frequency and associated factors are unknown. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to assess longitudinal intra-individual WMH volume changes in sporadic SVD.","During egg laying, female birds face a trade-off between self-maintenance and investment into current reproduction. Providing eggs with resources is energetically demanding, since in most species females lay one egg per day. However, the costs of egg laying not only relate to energetic requirements, but also depend on the availability of specific resources that are vital for egg production and embryonic development. One of these compounds are carotenoids, pigments with antioxidant properties and immuno-stimulatory functions, which are crucial during embryonic development. In this study, we explore how carotenoid availability alleviates this trade-off and facilitates egg laying in the blue tit. Blue tit females lay one egg per day and have the largest clutch size of all European passerines. We performed a lutein supplementation experiment, and measured potential consequences for egg laying capacity and egg quality. We found that lutein-supplemented females had less laying interruptions and thus completed their clutch faster than control females. No effects of treatment were found on the onset of egg laying or clutch size. Experimentally enhanced carotenoid availability did not elevate yolk carotenoid levels or egg mass, but negatively affected eggshell thickness. Our results provide hence evidence on the limiting role of carotenoids during egg laying, However, the benefits of laying faster following lutein supplementation were counterbalanced by a lower accumulation of calcium in the eggshell. Thus, even though single components may constrain egg laying, it is the combined availability of a range of different resources which ultimately determines egg quality and thus embryonic development.","The characteristics of animal products depend on a number of factors linked both to cheese-making technology and to the chemical and microbiological characteristics of the raw material used. These characteristics are themselves dependent on upstream factors (genetic, physiological, or dietary). Those upstream factors have increasingly been the focus of consumers'concern, in particular those related to animal feeding. They take special importance in the case of labelled products (Protected Designation of Origin [PDO], Protected Geographical Indication [PDI], etc.) which claim close links with production conditions. During last years, a number of works have been done to precise, in experimental conditions, the effects of each of these factors on the different dimensions of quality (sensorial, nutritional, hygienic...), as well as their integrated effects when they are observed in a more systemic approach, in the frame of farming systems. Examples from different species (poultry, pork, fish, bovine) are given to illustrate some of these effects.","Introduction Polygenic hazard score (PHS) models are associated with age at diagnosis of prostate cancer. Our model developed in Europeans (PHS46), showed reduced performance in men with African genetic ancestry. We used a cross-validated search to identify SNPs that might improve performance in this population.","Insights from extreme-adapted organisms, which have evolved natural strategies for promoting survivability under severe environmental pressures, may help guide future research into novel approaches for enhancing human longevity. The cave-adapted Mexican tetra,Astyanax mexicanus, has attracted interest as a model system for metabolic resilience, a term we use to denote the property of maintaining robust health and longevity under conditions that would have highly deleterious effects in other organisms (Fig 1). Cave-dwelling populations of Mexi-can tetra exhibit elevated blood glucose and possess a mutation in the insulin receptor that in humans has been linked to Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome, a condition characterized by severe insulin resistance that causes numerous developmental abnormalities, is highly associated with debilitating progression, and drastically reduces lifespan. In addition, cavefish develop large numbers of hypertrophic visceral adipocytes and possess vastly enriched stores of body fat compared to surface-dwelling counterparts. However, cavefish appear to avoid the progression of the respective pathologies typically associated with these conditions, such as accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), chronic tissue inflammation, impaired growth due to insulin dysregulation, and low survivability due to arterial disease. The metabolic strategies underlying the resilience properties of A. mexicanus cavefish, and how they relate to environmental challenges of the cave environment, are poorly understood. Here, we provide an untargeted metabolomics study of long- and short-term fasting in two A. mexicanus cave populations and one surface population. We find that, although cave-fish share many similarities with metabolic syndrome normally associated with the human state of obesity, important differences emerge, including a reduction in cholesteryl esters and intermediates of protein glycation, and an increase in antioxidants and metabolites associated with hypoxia and longevity. We find important overlaps between metabolic alterations in cave-dwelling Mexican tetra and other models of resilience and extreme longevity, such as naked mole-rats, including enhanced reliance on sugars as an energy source and a trend toward more potent antioxidant activity. This work suggests that certain metabolic features associated with human pathologies are not intrinsically harmful, but are rather consequences of suboptimal adaptation of humans to survival under adverse metabolic conditions, and suggests promising avenues for future investigation into the role of metabolic strategies in evolutionary adaptation and health. We provide a transparent pipeline for reproducing our analysis and a Shiny app for other researchers to explore and visualize our dataset.","The SEN virus (SENV) has been linked to transfusion-associated non-A-E hepatitis; however, information regarding SENV infections in patients with thalassemia, particularly in those with hepatitis virus co-infections, remains limited. This study investigated the frequency of SENV (genotypes D and H) infections in Iraqi patients with thalassemia who were and were not infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). The study involved 150 \u03b2-thalessemia patients (75 with HCV infections and 75 without) and 75 healthy blood donors. Patient levels of vitamins C and E, liver function markers, and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) were determined. Recovered viral nucleic acids were amplified using the conventional polymerase chain reaction (SENV DNA) or the real-time polymerase chain reaction (HCV RNA) techniques. Only 10% of healthy donors had evidence of SENV infection. Among patients with thalassemia, 80% and 77% of patients with and without concurrent HCV infections, respectively, had SENV infections. DNA sequencing analyses were performed on blood samples obtained from 29 patients. Patients with thalassemia, particularly those with SENV infections, had higher levels of several enzymatic liver function markers and total serum bilirubin (P &lt; 0.05) than did healthy blood donors. Among the examined liver function markers, only gamma-glutamyl transferase demonstrated significantly higher levels in HCV-negative patients infected with SENV-H than in those infected with SENV-D (P = 0.01). There were significantly lower vitamin C, vitamin E, and glutathione peroxidase levels in patients than in healthy donors (P &lt; 0.05), but only glutathione peroxidase levels were significantly lower in HCV-negative thalassemia patients infected with SENV than in those without SENV infections (P = 0.04). The SENV-H genotype sequences were similar to the global standard genes in GenBank. These results increase our understanding of the nature of the SENV-H genotype and the differential role of SENV-H infections, compared to SENV-D infections, in patients with thalassemia, in Iraq.","The interaction of Tween-20 with lipid membranes is crucial for a number of biotechnological applications including viral inactivation and membrane protein extraction, but the underlying mechanistic details have remained elusive. Evidence from ensemble assays supports a global model of Tween-20 induced membrane disruption that broadly encompasses association of the surfactant with the membrane surface, membrane fragmentation and the release of mixed micelles to solution, but whether this process involves intermediate and dynamic transitions between regimes is an open question. In search of the mechanistic origins of membrane disruption, increasing focus is put on identifying Tween-20 interactions with highly controllable model membranes. In light of this, and to unveil quantitative mechanistic details, we employed highly interdisciplinary biophysical approaches, including quartz-crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring, steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence and FRET spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, wide-field single-vesicle imaging and scanning electron microscopy, to interrogate the interactions between Tween-20 and both freely-diffusing and surface-immobilized model-membrane vesicles. Using ultrasensitive sensing approaches, we discovered that Tween-20 leads to a stepwise and phase-dependent structural remodelling of sub-micron sized vesicles that includes permeabilization and swelling, even at detergent concentrations below the critical micellar concentration. These insights into the structural perturbation of lipid vesicles upon Tween-20 interaction highlight the impact on vesicle conformation prior to complete solubilization, and the tools presented may have general relevance for probing the interaction between lipid vesicles and a wide variety of disruptive agents.","Lipid droplets are lipid storage organelles found in nearly all cell types from adipocytes to cancer cells. Although increasingly implicated in disease, current methods to study lipid droplets require fixation or static imaging which limits investigation of their rapid in vivo dynamics. To address this, we created a lipid droplet transgenic reporter in whole animals and cell culture by fusing tdTOMATO to Perilipin-2 (PLIN2), a lipid droplet structural protein. Expression of this transgene in transparent casper zebrafish enabled in vivo imaging of adipose depots responsive to nutrient deprivation and high-fat diet. Using this system, we tested novel regulators of lipolysis, revealing an unexpected role for nitric oxide in modulating adipocyte lipid droplets. Similarly, we expressed the PLIN2-tdTOMATO transgene in melanoma cells and found that the nitric oxide pathway also regulated lipid droplets in cancer. This model offers a tractable imaging platform to study lipid droplets across cell types and disease contexts.","The effects of UV light on the skin have been extensively investigated. However, systematic information about how exposure to UVA light, the least energetic but the most abundant UV radiation reaching the Earth, shapes the subcellular organization of proteins is lacking. Using subcellular fractionation, mass spectrometry-based proteomics, machine learning algorithms, immunofluorescence, and functional assays, we mapped the subcellular reorganization of the proteome of human keratinocytes in response to UVA light. Our workflow quantified and assigned subcellular localization for over 1600 proteins, of which about 200 were found to redistribute upon UVA exposure. Reorganization of the proteome affected modulators of signaling pathways, cellular metabolism, and DNA damage response. Strikingly, mitochondria were identified as one of the main targets of UVA-induced stress. Further investigation demonstrated that UVA induces mitochondrial fragmentation, up-regulates redox-responsive proteins and attenuates respiratory rates. These observations emphasize the role of this radiation as a potent metabolic stressor in the skin.","  In biological membranes, alpha-tocopherols ({\\alpha}-toc; vitamin E) protect\npolyunsaturated lipids from free radicals. Although the interactions of\n{\\alpha}-toc with non-oxidized lipid bilayers have been studied, their on\noxidized bilayers remain unknown. In this study, atomistic molecular dynamics\n(MD) simulations of oxidized lipid bilayers were performed with varying\nconcentrations of {\\alpha}-toc. Bilayers with\n1-palmitoyl-2-lauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PLPC) lipids and its\naldehyde derivatives at 1:1 ratio were studied. Our simulations show that\noxidized lipids self-assemble into aggregates with a water pore rapidly\ndeveloping across the lipid bilayer. The free energy of transporting an\n{\\alpha}-toc molecule in a lipid bilayer suggests that {\\alpha}-tocs can\npassively adsorb into the bilayer. When {\\alpha}-toc molecules were present at\nlow concentrations in bilayers containing oxidized lipids, the formation of\nwater pores was slowed down. At high {\\alpha}-toc concentra-tions, no pores\nwere observed. Based on the simulations, we propose that the mechanism of how\n{\\alpha}-toc inhibits pore formation in bilayers with oxidized lipids is the\nfollow-ing: {\\alpha}-tocs trap the polar groups of the oxidized lipids at the\nmembrane-water interface resulting in a decreased probability for the oxidized\nlipids to reach contact with the two leaflets and initiate pore formation. This\ndemon-strates that {\\alpha}-toc molecules not only protect the bilayer from\noxidation but also help to stabilize the bilayer after lipid peroxidation\noccurs. These results will help in de-signing more efficient molecules to\nprotect membranes from oxidative stress.\n","Background Observational studies have linked obesity and especially abdominal obesity to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). These traits are also associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and coronary artery disease (CAD) but the causal factor(s) underlying these associations remain unexplored.","A major challenge in drug discovery is gaining confidence in the human relevance of pre-clinical animal studies. While human iPSC-derived organoids offer exciting opportunities to address this, concerns about applicability and scalability remain. Here, we report a high-throughput organoid platform for assessment of kidney disease targeting compounds in a human system. We confirmed platform reproducibility by single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) and derived a NanoString panel for efficient quality control (QC). Organoid transplantation in rats for 2 to 4 weeks promoted organoid maturation and vascularization. In functional studies, cyclosporine A (CsA) and GFB-887, a novel TRPC5 channel blocker, protected kidney organoids from injury. Pharmacodynamic studies with GFB-887 delivered orally to rats were also successfully performed in human transplanted organoids. These data show how human organoids can deliver confidence in taking development candidate compounds to the clinic, fulfilling their promise to revolutionize drug discovery.","Water being a vital part of cell protoplasm plays a significant role in sustaining life on earth; drastic changes in climatic condition leads to limit the availability of water and causing other environmental chaos. Alpha-tocopherol being a powerful antioxidant plays a vital role in scavenging the ill effects of oxidative stress. A pot experiment was conducted by exposing lentil cultivar (Punjab-2009) to varying levels of induced drought stress, sprinkled with \u03b1-tocopherol 100, 200 and 300 mg/L. Induced water deficit stress conditions caused a pronounced decline in growth parameters including absolute growth rate (AGR), leaf area index (LAI), leaf area ratio (LAR), root shoot ratio (RSR), relative growth rate (RGR), chlorophyll a, b, total chlorophyll content, carotenoids and soluble protein content (SPC) which were significantly enhanced by exogenously applied \u03b1-tocopherol. Moreover, a significant increase was reported in total proline content (TPC), soluble sugar content (SSC), glycine betaine (GB) content, endogenous tocopherol levels, ascorbate peroxidase (APX), catalase (CAT) peroxidase (POD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities. On contrary, exogenously applied \u03b1-tocopherol significantly reduced the concentrations of malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In conclusion, it was confirmed that exogenously applied \u03b1-tocopherol under induced drought stress regimes ameliorated drought stress tolerance potential of lentil cultivar to a great extent; by enhancing growth, physiological and biochemical attributes.","Rationale Pneumonia is a respiratory condition with complex aetiology. Host genetic variation is thought to contribute to individual differences in susceptibility and symptom manifestation.","Light absorbed by chlorophylls of photosystem II and I drives oxygenic photosynthesis. Light-harvesting complexes increase the absorption cross-section of these photosystems. Furthermore, these complexes play a central role in photoprotection by dissipating the excess of absorbed light energy in an inducible and regulated fashion. In higher plants, the main light-harvesting complex is the trimeric LHCII.","Tissue engineered hyaline cartilage is plagued by poor mechanical properties largely due to inadequate type II collagen expression. Of note, commonly used defined chondrogenic media lack 14 vitamins and minerals, some of which are implicated in chondrogenesis. Type II collagen promoter-driven Gaussia luciferase was transfected into ATDC5 cells to create a chondrogenic cell with a secreted-reporter. The reporter cells were used in an aggregate-based chondrogenic culture model to develop a high-throughput analytic platform. This high-throughput platform was used to assess the effect of vitamins and minerals, alone and in combination with TGF\u03b21, on type II collagen expression. Significant combinatorial effects between vitamins, minerals and TGF\u03b21 in terms of type II collagen expression and metabolism were discovered. An \u2018optimal\u2019 continual supplement of copper and vitamin K in the presence of TGF\u03b21 gave a 2.5-fold increase in collagen expression over TGF\u03b21 supplemented media alone.","L-Tyrosine (Tyr) is an aromatic amino acid synthesized de novo in plants and microbes downstream of the shikimate pathway. In plants, Tyr and a Tyr pathway intermediate, 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (HPP), are precursors to numerous specialized metabolites, which are crucial for plant and human health. Tyr is synthesized in the plastids by a TyrA family enzyme, arogenate dehydrogenase (ADH/TyrAa), which is feedback inhibited by Tyr. In addition to ADH enzymes, many legumes possess prephenate dehydrogenases (PDH/TyrAp), which are insensitive to Tyr and localized to the cytosol. Yet the role of PDH in legumes is currently unknown. This study isolated and characterized Tnt1-transposon mutants of MtPDH1 (pdh1) in Medicago truncatula to investigate PDH function. The pdh1 mutants lacked PDH transcript, PDH activity, and displayed little aberrant morphological phenotypes under standard growth conditions providing genetic evidence that MtPDH1 is responsible for the PDH activity detected in M. truncatula. Though plant PDH enzymes and activity have been specifically found in legumes, nodule number and nitrogenase activity of pdh1 mutants were not significantly reduced compared to wild-type (Wt) during symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Although Tyr levels were not significantly different between Wt and mutants under standard conditions, when carbon flux was increased by shikimate precursor feeding, mutants accumulated significantly less Tyr than Wt. These data suggest that MtPDH1 is involved in Tyr biosynthesis when the shikimate pathway is stimulated, and possibly linked to unidentified legume-specific specialized metabolism.","Low temperature is one of the important environmental factors that affect rice growth and yield. To better understand the japonica rice responses to cold stress, isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) labeling based quantitative proteomics approach was used to detected changes in protein level. Two-week-old seedlings of the cold tolerance rice variety Kongyu131 were treated at 8\u00b0C for 24, 48 and 72 h, then the total proteins were extracted from tissues and used for quantitative proteomics analysis. A total of 5082 proteins were detected for quantitative analysis, of which 289 proteins were significantly regulated, consisting of 169 uniquely up-regulated proteins and 125 uniquely down-regulated proteins in cold stress groups relative to control group. Functional analysis revealed most of regulation proteins involved in photosynthesis, metabolic pathway, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and carbon metabolism. Western blot analysis showed that protein regulation was consistent with the iTRAQ data. The corresponding genes of 25 regulation proteins were used for quantitative real time PCR analysis, and the results showed that the mRNA level was not always parallel to the corresponding protein level. The importance of our study is providing new insights into cold stress responses in rice on proteomic aspect.","High-impact temporomandibular disorder (TMD) pain may involve brain mechanisms related to central sensitization. We investigated brain responses to stimulation of trigeminal sites not typically associated with TMD pain by applying noxious dentoalveolar pressure to high- and low-impact TMD pain cases and pain-free controls during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Fifty female participants were recruited and assigned to one of three groups based on the Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (DC/TMD) and Graded Chronic Pain Scale: controls (n=17), low-impact (n=17) and high-impact TMD (n=16). Multimodal whole-brain MRI was acquired following the Human Connectome Project protocol, including stimulus-evoked fMRI scans during which painful dentoalveolar pressure was applied to the buccal gingiva of participants. Group analyses were performed using non-parametric permutation tests for parcellated cortical and subcortical neuroimaging data. There were no significant between-group differences for brain activations/deactivations evoked by the noxious dentoalveolar pressure. For individual group mean activations/deactivations, a gradient in the number of parcels surviving thresholding was found according to the TMD pain grade, with the highest number seen in the high-impact group. Among the brain regions activated in chronic TMD pain groups were those previously implicated in sensory-discriminative and motivational-affective pain processing. These results suggest that dentoalveolar pressure pain evokes abnormal brain responses to sensory processing of noxious stimuli in high-impact TMD pain participants, which supports the presence of maladaptive brain plasticity in chronic TMD pain.","Elevated uric acid (UA) is a key factor for disorders, including gout or kidney stones and result from abrogated expression of Urate Oxidase (Uro) and diet. To understand the genetic pathways influencing UA metabolism we established a Drosophila melanogaster model with elevated UA using Uro knockdown. Reduced Uro expression resulted in the accumulation of UA concretions and diet-dependent shortening of lifespan. Inhibition of insulin-like signaling (ILS) pathway genes reduced UA and concretion load. In humans, SNPs in the ILS genes AKT2 and FOXO3 were associated with UA levels or gout, supporting a conserved role for ILS in modulating UA metabolism. Downstream of the ILS pathway UA pathogenicity was mediated partly by NADPH Oxidase, whose inhibition attenuated the reduced lifespan and concretion accumulation. Thus, genes in the ILS pathway represent potential therapeutic targets for treating UA associated pathologies, including gout and kidney stones.","Alpha-tocopherols (\u03b1-toc) are crucial in protecting biological membranes against oxidation by free radicals. We investigate the behavior of \u03b1-toc molecules in lipid bilayers containing oxidized lipids by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. To verify the approach, the location and orientation of \u03b1-toc are first shown to be in agreement with previous experimental results. The simulations further show that \u03b1-toc molecules stay inside the lipid bilayer with their hydroxyl groups in contact with the bilayer surface. Interestingly, interbilayer \u03b1-toc flip-flop was observed in both oxidized and non-oxidized bilayers with significantly higher frequency in aldehyde lipid bilayer. Free energy calculations were performed and estimates of the flip-flop rates across the bilayers were determined. As the main finding, our results show that the presence of oxidized lipids leads to a significant decrease of free energy barriers and that the flip-flop rates depend on the type of oxidized lipid present. Our results suggest that \u03b1-toc molecules could potentially act as high efficacy scavengers of free radicals to protect membranes from oxidative attack and help stabilize them under oxidative stress.","Cancer cells show a bias toward the glycolytic system over the conventional mitochondrial electron transfer system for obtaining energy. This biased metabolic adaptation is called the Warburg effect. Cancer cells also exhibit a characteristic metabolism, a decreased heme synthesizing ability. Here we show that heme synthesis and the Warburg effect are inversely correlated. We used human gastric cancer cell lines to investigate glycolytic metabolism and electron transfer system toward promotion/inhibition of heme synthesis. Under hypoxic conditions, heme synthesis was suppressed and the glycolytic system was enhanced. Addition of a heme precursor for the promotion of heme synthesis led to an enhanced electron transfer system and inhibited the glycolytic system and vice versa. Enhanced heme synthesis leads to suppression of cancer cell proliferation by increasing intracellular reactive oxygen species levels. Collectively, the promotion of heme synthesis in cancer cells eliminated the Warburg effect by shifting energy metabolism from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation.","Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CURE\u2019s) are emerging as a means to engage large numbers of undergraduate students in meaningful inquiry-based research activities. We describe here a simple laboratory exercise as part of an undergraduate genetics course that illustrates the contributions of oncogenes and tumor suppressors to the formation of neoplasms in an invertebrate model system. In addition, students were challenged to investigate whether flies reared on a diet containing a variety of additives display a higher number of invasive tumors in the larval abdomen.","Kidney cancers are characterized by extensive metabolic reprogramming and resistance to a broad range of anti-cancer therapies. By interrogating the Cancer Therapeutics Response Portal compound sensitivity dataset, we show that cells of clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) possess a lineage-specific vulnerability to ferroptosis that can be exploited by inhibiting glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). Using genome-wide CRISPR screening and lipidomic profiling, we reveal that this vulnerability is driven by the HIF-2\u03b1\u2013HILPDA pathway by inducing a polyunsaturated fatty acyl (PUFA)-lipid-enriched cell state that is dependent on GPX4 for survival and susceptible to ferroptosis. This cell state is developmentally primed by the HNF-1\u03b2\u20131-Acylglycerol-3-Phosphate O-Acyltransferase 3 (AGPAT3) axis in the renal lineage. In addition to PUFA metabolism, ferroptosis is facilitated by a phospholipid flippase TMEM30A involved in membrane topology. Our study uncovers an oncogenesis-associated vulnerability, delineates the underlying mechanisms and suggests targeting GPX4 to induce ferroptosis as a therapeutic opportunity in ccRCC.","The Absence of bc1 Complex (ABC1) is an ancient, atypical protein kinase family that emerged prior to the archaeal-eubacterial divergence. Loss-of-function mutants in ABC1 genes are linked to respiratory defects in microbes and humans, and to compromised photosynthetic performance and stress tolerance in plants. However, demonstration of protein kinase activity remains elusive, hampering their study. Here, we investigate a homolog from Arabidopsis thaliana, AtABC1K6, and demonstrate in vitro protein kinase activity as autophosphorylation, which we replicate with a human ABC1 ortholog. We show that AtABC1K6 protein kinase activity requires an atypical buffer composition, including Mn2+ as divalent cation co-factor and a low salt concentration. AtABC1K6 associates with plastoglobule lipid droplets of A. thaliana chloroplasts, along with five paralogs. Protein kinase activity associated with isolated A. thaliana plastoglobules was inhibited at higher salt concentrations, but could accommodate Mg2+ as well as Mn2+, indicating salt sensitivity, but not the requirement for Mn2+, may be a general characteristic of ABC1s. Loss of functional AtABC1K6 impairs the developmental transition from vegetative to reproductive growth. This phenotype is complemented by the wild-type sequence of AtABC1K6 but not by a kinase-dead point mutant in the unique Ala-triad of the ATP-binding pocket, demonstrating the physiological relevance of the protein\u2019s kinase activity. We suggest that ABC1s are bona fide protein kinases with a unique regulatory mechanism. Our results open the door to detailed functional and mechanistic studies of ABC1s and plastoglobules.","Several species of the soil borne fungus of the genus Trichoderma are known to be versatile, opportunistic plant symbionts, and are the most successful biocontrol agents used in today\u2019s agriculture. To be successful in the field conditions, the fungus must endure varying climatic conditions. Studies have indicated that high atmospheric temperature coupled with low humidity is a major limitation for the inconsistent performance of Trichoderma under field conditions. Understanding the molecular modulation associated with such Trichoderma that persist and deliver under abiotic stress condition will aid in exploiting the worth of these organisms for such use. In this study, comparative proteomic analysis using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF-TOF) mass spectrometry was used to identify proteins associated with thermotolerance in two thermotolerant isolates of Trichoderma\u2014T. longibrachiatum 673, TaDOR673 and T. asperellum 7316, TaDOR7316\u2014and 32 differentially expressed proteins were identified. Sequence homology and conserved domains were used to identify these proteins and to assign probable function to them. Thermotolerant isolate, TaDOR673, seemed to employ the stress signaling MAPK pathways and heat shock response pathways to combat the stress condition whereas the moderately tolerant isolate, TaDOR7316, seemed to adapt to high temperature conditions by reducing the accumulation of mis-folded proteins through unfolded protein response pathway and autophagy. Also, there were unique as well as common proteins that were differentially expressed in the two isolates studied.","Sentinel species are playing an indispensable role in monitoring environmental pollution in aquatic ecosystems. Many pollutants found in water prove to be endocrine disrupting chemicals that could cause disruptions in lipid homeostasis in aquatic species. A comprehensive profiling of the lipidome of these species is thus an essential step towards understanding the mechanism of toxicity induced by pollutants. We here extensively examined both the composition and spatial distribution of lipids in freshwater crustacean Gammarus fossarum. The baseline lipidome of gammarids of different gender and reproductive stage was established by high throughput shotgun lipidomics. Spatial lipid mapping by high resolution mass spectrometry imaging led to the discovery of sulfate-based lipids in hepatopancreas and their accumulation in mature oocytes. We uncovered in G. fossarum a diverse and dynamic lipid composition that deepens our understanding of the biochemical changes during development and which could serve as a reference for future ecotoxicological studies."],"title":["Context-based facilitation in visual word recognition: Evidence for visual and lexical but not pre-lexical contributions","Contraction of the ROS scavenging enzyme glutathione S-transferase gene family in cetaceans","ANMCO/ISS/AMD/ANCE/ARCA/FADOI/GICR-IACPR/SICI-GISE/SIBioC/SIC/SICOA/SID/SIF/SIMEU/SIMG/SIMI/SISA Joint Consensus Document on cholesterol and cardiovascular risk: diagnostic\u2013therapeutic pathway in Italy","Cholesterol-Lowering Action of a Novel Nutraceutical Combination in Uremic Rats: Insights into the Molecular Mechanism in a Hepatoma Cell Line","Identification of mundulone and mundulone acetate as natural products with tocolytic efficacy in mono- and combination-therapy with current tocolytics","Etude des pratiques dans la prise en charge de la maladie de La Peyronie en France","CD31 Expression Determines Redox Status and Chemoresistance in Human Angiosarcomas","Near-infrared light increases functional connectivity with a non-thermal mechanism","Correlation between vitamin A, E, coenzyme Q","The Effects of Vitamin E Analogues \u03b1-Tocopherol and \u03b3-Tocotrienol on the Human Osteocyte Response to Ultra-high Molecular Weight Polyethylene Wear Particles","Increasing Of Functionality Meat And Meat Products","Fabrication and Evaluation of Mechanical and Tribological Properties of ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene-based Nanocomposites Reinforced with Hydroxyapatite, Zirconia and Multi-walled Carbon Nanotubes","Yellow nail syndrome resulting from cardiac mitral valve replacement","Probiotics treatment improves cognitive impairment in patients and animals: a systematic review and meta-analysis","Multi-omic landscaping of human midbrains identifies neuroinflammation as major disease mechanism in advanced-stage Parkinson\u2019s disease","Antioxidant effects of alpha-tocopherol (vitamine E) on testis regeneration in busulfan-treated mice","Targeted screening for Alzheimer\u2019s disease clinical trials using data-driven disease progression models","Dietary supplements during the COVID-19 pandemic: insights from 1.4M users of the COVID Symptom Study app - a longitudinal app-based community survey","The contribution of parent-to-offspring transmission of telomeres to the heritability of telomere length in humans","Monocarboxylate transporter 1 in Schwann cells is critical for maintenance of sensory nerve myelination during aging","A Dormant Microbial Component in the Development of Pre-Eclampsia1","The disruption of trace element homeostasis due to aneuploidy as a unifying theme in the etiology of cancer","Factors Associated With Post-craniotomy Headache After Microvascular Decompression in Hemifacial Spasm","A studyforrest extension, MEG recordings while watching the audio-visual movie \u201cForrest Gump\u201d","Space-time resolved inference-based whole-brain neurophysiological mechanism imaging: application to resting-state alpha rhythm","The impact of eye closure on anticipatory alpha activity in a tactile discrimination task","An Active Component of ","Baseline functional connectivity in resting state networks associated with depression and remission status after 16 weeks of pharmacotherapy: A CAN-BIND Report","Ataxia with Vitamin E Deficiency in Norway","Evidence for immediate enhancement of hippocampal memory encoding by network-targeted theta-burst stimulation during concurrent fMRI","Breath biomarkers of insulin resistance in pre-diabetic Hispanic adolescents with obesity","Feeding dihydroquercetin and vitamin E to broiler chickens reared at standard and high ambient temperatures","scTenifoldNet: a machine learning workflow for constructing and comparing transcriptome-wide gene regulatory networks from single-cell data","X-ray fluorescence microscopy reveals the role of selenium in spermatogenesis","Economic implications of polypharmacy in Nepal: Multicenter community-based study","Effects of Blackcurrant Anthocyanin on Endothelial Function and Peripheral Temperature in Young Smokers","Evaluation of the growth performance, physiological traits, antioxidant indices, and heat shock protein 70 to dietary supplementation of stinging nettle (Urtica dioica) in broilers exposed to chronic heat stress","Cognitive Practice Effects Delay Diagnosis;

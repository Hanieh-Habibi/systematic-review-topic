This work aimed to study the severity scores of such two common pain-related disorders in relation to various macronutrients and micronutrients intake. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted on patients with concomitant migraine and IBS. The frequency and intensity of migraine attacks and the severity of IBS were evaluated. Data on dietary intake were collected using food frequency questionnaires and 24-hour dietary recall. Results One-hundred patients with a median age of 36 years participated. The severity scores for migraine and IBS were positively correlated with fat and copper and negatively correlated with fiber and zinc intake. Copper intake was an independent predictor of the severity of both migraine and IBS (P 0.033, &lt; 0.001). Patients with episodic migraine (n = 69) had a significantly higher frequency of cooked, fresh vegetables, and wheat bran bread intake (P 0.009, 0.004, 0.021) and lower frequency of hydrogenated oils intake (P 0.046), in comparison to patients with chronic migraine (n = 31). Patients with moderate intensity of migraine (n = 37) had a significantly higher frequency of herbal drinks intake (P 0.014) than patients with a severe intensity of migraine (n = 63). Patients with mild (n = 13) and moderate IBS (n = 41) had a significantly higher frequency of wheat bran bread and sen bread intake (P 0.003, 0.022) than patients with severe IBS (n = 46). Conclusion Patients with comorbid migraine and IBS are advised to adhere to a diet low in fat and copper and rich in fiber and zinc.

","This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of tenofovir (TDF) and TDF combined with emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 infections. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with clinical suspicion of mild to moderate respiratory infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 who were treated at an outpatient clinic. Patients were randomly recruited to take 10 days of TDF (300 mg/day), TDF (300 mg/day) combined with FTC (200 mg/day) or placebo Vitamin C (500 mg/day). The primary parameter was the score of symptoms and predictive signs of COVID-19, assessed on the seventh day of patient follow-up. From a total of 309 patients with clinical suspicion of SARS-CoV-2, 227 met the inclusion criteria and were randomly distributed into the following groups: (a) 75 (one did not initiate treatment) in the TDF group; (b) 74 in the TDF combined with FTC group; and (c) 77 in the Vitamin C group (placebo). Of the 226 patients, 139 (62%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Fever (\u226537.8\u00b0C), ageusia or dysgeusia, anosmia or dysosmia, and two or more clinical symptoms or signs were significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. There was no significant change in clinical score based on clinical symptoms and signs between treatment groups. Patients with mild to moderate infection by SARS-CoV-2 had higher concentrations of G-CSF, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 compared to patients without infection. Patients with mild to moderate respiratory infection, with fever (\u226537.8\u00b0C), loss of smell, loss of taste and two or more symptoms, have a better prediction for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 showed higher and more persistent proinflammatory cytokines profile compared to patients not infected with SARS-CoV-2. Pharmacological intervention with TDF or TDF combined with FTC did not change the clinical signs and symptoms score in mild to moderate respiratory infection in patients with SARS-CoV-2 compared to the Vitamin C group (placebo).","","Background Observational studies have suggested associations between circulating antioxidant levels and many mental disorders, but evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is lacking and causal inferences have not been confirmed. The aim of this study was to explore whether genetically predicted diet-derived circulating antioxidants were causally associated with the risk of major mental disorders using Mendelian randomization (MR).","Introduction Previous studies in mostly Western populations, have yielded conflicting findings on the association of vitamin B12 with diabetes risk, in part, due to differences in study design and population characteristics. This study sought to examine the vitamin B12 \u2013 diabetes association in Chinese hypertensive adults by both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses.","Our COVID-19 drug candidate ARTIVeda\u2122/PulmoHeal is a novel gelatin capsule formulation of the Artemisia extract Ayurveda for oral delivery of TGF-\u03b2 targeting anti-malaria phytomedicine Artemisinin with documented anti-inflammatory and anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Here we report the safety and efficacy of ARTIVeda\u2122 in adult COVID-19 patients with symptomatic mild-moderate COVID-19, who were treated in a randomized, open-label Phase IV study in Bangalore, Karnataka, India (Clinical Trials Registry India identifier: CTRI/2020/09/028044). ARTIVeda showed a very favorable safety profile, and the only ARTIVeda-related adverse events were transient mild rash and mild hypertension. Notably, ARTIVeda, when added to the SOC, accelerated the recovery of patients with mild-moderate COVID-19. While all patients were symptomatic at baseline (WHO score = 2-4), 31 of 39 (79.5%) of patients treated with ARTIVeda plus SOC became asymptomatic (WHO score = 1) by the end of the 5-day therapy, including 10 of 10 patients with severe dry cough 7 of 7 patients with severe fever. By comparison, 12 of 21 control patients (57.1%) treated with SOC alone became asymptomatic on day 5 (P=0.028, Fisher\u2019s exact test). This clinical benefit was particularly evident when the treatment outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients (WHO score = 4) treated with SOC alone versus SOC plus ARTIVeda were compared. The median time to becoming asymptomatic was only 5 days for the SOC plus ARTIVeda group (N=18) but 14 days for the SOC alone group (N=10) (P=0.004, Log-rank test). These data provide clinical proof of concept that targeting the TGF-\u03b2 pathway with ARTIVeda may contribute to a faster recovery of patients with mild-moderate COVID-19 when administered early in the course of their disease.","","The SARS-Cov-2 pandemic that currently affects the entire world has been shown to be especially dangerous in the elderly (&gt;=65 years) and in smokers, with notably strong comorbidity in patients already suffering from chronic diseases, such as Type 2 diabetes, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases, obesity, and hypertension. Inflammation of the lungs is the main factor leading to respiratory distress in patients with chronic respiratory disease and in patients with severe COVID-19. Several studies have shown that inflammation of the lungs in general and Type 2 diabetes are accompanied by the degradation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), especially heparan sulfate (HS). Several studies have also shown the importance of countering the degradation of HS in lung infections and Type 2 diabetes. D-xylose, which is the initiating element for different sulfate GAG chains (especially HS), has shown regeneration properties for GAGs. D-xylose and xylitol have demonstrated anti-inflammatory, antiglycemic, antiviral, and antibacterial properties in lung infections, alone or in combination with antibiotics. Considering the existing research on COVID-19 and related to D-xylose/xylitol, this review offers a perspective on why the association between D-xylose and antibiotics may contribute to significantly reducing the duration of treatment of COVID-19 patients and why some anti-inflammatory drugs may increase the severity of COVID-19. A strong correlation with scurvy, based on gender, age, ethnicity, smoking status, and obesity status, is also reviewed. Related to this, the effects of treatment with plants such as Artemisia are also addressed. Chemical compounds D-xylose; xylitol; l-ascorbic Acid; D-glucuronic acid; N-acetylglucosamine; D-N-acetylglucosamine; N-acetylgalactosamine; galactose. Graphical abstract Highlights * D-xylose significantly stimulated the biosynthesis of sulfated GAGs, especially HS. * Risk factors: age/gender/smoking/obesity &amp; ethnicity are not specific to COVID-19. * D-xylose has anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties in lung infections. * D-xylose/xylitol improves antibiotic activity and has antiglycemic properties. * D-xylose interacts with some NSAIDs. ","Nephron endowment is defined by fetal kidney growth and critically dictates renal health in adults. Despite the advances in understanding the molecular regulation of nephron progenitors, the causes for low congenital nephron count and contribution of basic metabolism to nephron progenitor biology remain poorly understood. Here we characterized the metabolic consequences of MAPK/ERK-deficiency in nephron progenitors, whose maintenance and propagation in developing kidney critically depends on ERK activation. Our LC/MS-based metabolomics profiling identified 42 reduced metabolites, of which 26 were further supported by in vivo transcriptional characterization of MAPK/ERK-deficient nephron progenitors. This revealed a severe shortage of energy and nucleotide biosynthesis precursors, blockage in glycolysis and diminished pyruvate and proline metabolism. Utilization of in vitro kidney cultures demonstrated a dosage-specific function for glycolytic pyruvate as an energy source that controls the shape of the ureteric bud tip kwon to serve as a niche for nephron progenitor regulation. Analysis of the proline biosynthesis effects in developing kidney in vivo revealed premature loss of nephron progenitor maintenance in the absence of Pycr1/2 functions. Our results suggest that MAPK/ERK-dependent nephron progenitor metabolism functionally contributes to progenitor preservation by controlling pyruvate availability and proline metabolism in developing kidneys.","University students are a vulnerable group for poor dietary intake, insufficient physical activity and sedentary behaviour. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of COVID-19 on university students\u2019 dietary intake, physical activity and sedentary behaviour. Participants were students (n=125) from the Universities of Saskatchewan and Regina. An online questionnaire was administered retrospectively (for pre-pandemic) and prospectively (during the pandemic) to examine students\u2019 dietary intake, physical activity and sedentary behaviour. Overall, nutrient and caloric intakes were significantly reduced (p&lt;0.05) during the pandemic, and alcohol intake increased (p=0.03). Before the pandemic, 16% and 54% of the participants were meeting the Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines for Adults (18\u201364 years) of 150 minutes of moderate-vigorous physical activity and 8 hours or less of sedentary activity respectively. Only 10% met the guidelines for physical activity while 30% met the guidelines for sedentary behaviour during the pandemic. The minutes per week spent engaging in moderate to vigorous physical activity during the pandemic decreased by approximately 20% (p&lt;0.001). The hours spent in sedentary activities increased by 3 hours per day (p&lt;0.001). Our findings confirm that during the pandemic, students\u2019 inadequate dietary intake, high alcohol consumption, low physical activity and high sedentary behaviour were significantly compounded.","Background While COVID-19 remains largely unclear and mortality continues to raise, early effective approaches prior to complications lack, as well as researches for characterization and therapeutical potential options in actual early COVID-19. Although females seem to be less affected than females, hyperandrogenic (HA) phenotype, like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), idiopathic hirsutism, congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) female androgenetic alopecia (AGA), or idiopathic HA may be at higher risk due to its inherent enhanced androgenic activity. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of any early pharmacological approach to females diagnosed with COVID-19 before seven days of symptoms, as well as investigate whether HA is an additional risk factor in this population.","","Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly desmoplastic, aggressive cancer that frequently progresses by liver metastasis1. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF), extracellular matrix (ECM), and type I collagen (Col I) support2\u20135 or restrain PDAC progression and may impede blood supply and nutrient availability6\u20138. The dichotomous role of the stroma in PDAC, and the mechanisms through which it influences patient survival and enables desmoplastic cancers escape nutrient limitation remain poorly understood. Here we show that matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-cleaved or intact Col I (cCol I and iCol I, respectively) exert opposing effects on PDAC bioenergetics, macropinocytosis (MP), tumor growth and liver metastasis. While cCol I activates DDR1 (discoidin domain receptor-1)-NF-\u03baB-p62-NRF2 signaling to promote PDAC growth, iCol I triggers DDR1 degradation and restrains PDAC growth. Patients whose tumors are enriched in iCol I and low in DDR1 and NRF2 have improved median survival compared to those enriched in cCol I, DDR1 and NRF2. Inhibition of DDR1-stimulated NF-\u03baB or mitochondrial biogenesis blocked tumorigenesis in wildtype mice but not in mice expressing MMP-resistant Col I. In summary, the diverse effects of tumor stroma on PDAC growth, metastasis, and patient survival are mediated through the Col I-DDR1-NF-\u03baB-NRF2-mitochondrial biogenesis pathway, presenting multiple new opportunities for PDAC therapy.","Introduction There is a lack of studies in adolescents with COVID-19 from developing countries. We aimed to describe the clinical profile and risk factors for severe disease in adolescents hospitalized with COVID-19.","Introduction With over 87,273,380 cases being reported and 1,899,440 deaths worldwide as of 9th January 2021, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become the worst-hit pandemic till date. Every day clinicians are bombarded with many new treatment options that claim to be better than the others.","Rationale Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) has a devastating impact on global health. Mtb is the causative agent of human pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), which claims 1.4 million lives per annum. During infection, differentially culturable bacilli (DCB) that fail to produce colonies on solid media but grow in liquid media supplemented with resuscitation-promoting factor (Rpf) proteins are formed. These Rpf-dependent mycobacteria are a major barrier to developing improved TB treatments and diagnostic tools.","","Despite decades of clinical investigations, there is currently no effective treatment for patients diagnosed with Chronic Pancreatitis (CP). Computational drug repurposing holds promise to rapidly identify therapeutics which may prove efficacious against the disease. Using a literature-derived knowledge graph, we train multiple machine learning models using embeddings based on i) the network topology of regulation bipartite networks, ii) protein primary structures and iii) molecule substructures. Using these models, we predict approved drugs that down-regulate the disease, and assess their proposed respective drug targets and mechanism of actions. We analyse the highest predicted drugs and find a diverse range of regulatory mechanisms including inhibition of fibrosis, inflammation, immmune response, oxidative stress and calcium homeostasis. Notably, we identify resiniferatoxin, a potent analogue of capsaicin, as a promising repurposable candidate due to its antiinflammatory properties, nociceptive pain suppression, and regulation of calcium homeostatis (through potentiation of mutant cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)). Resiniferatoxin may also regulate intracellular acinar Ca2+ via agonism of transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily member 6 (TRPV6). We believe the potential of this repurposable drug warrants further in silico and in vitro testing, particularly the affect of the TRPV6 agonism on disease pathogenesis.","In 2010, the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) started the Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-be (nuMoM2b), a prospective cohort study of a racially/ethnically/geographically diverse population of nulliparous women with singleton gestation. The nuMoM2b is a very large dataset, consisting of data for 10,038 patients with over 4,600 features per patient, spread out over 80 files. In this report, we share our experience preparing and working with this dataset. We present our data preprocessing of the nuMoM2b dataset to get a deeper understanding of the data, extract the most relevant features, make the fewest assumptions when filling in unknown values, and reducing the dimensionality of the data. We hope this report is useful to researchers interested in building machine learning and statistical models from the nuMoM2b dataset.","Transporters are transmembrane proteins that mediate the selective translocation of solutes across biological membranes. Recently, we have shown that specific interactions with plasma membrane phospholipids are essential for formation and/or stability of functional dimers of the purine transporter, UapA, a prototypic eukaryotic member of the ubiquitous NAT family. Here, we show that distinct interactions of UapA with specific or annular lipids are essential for ab initio formation of functional dimers in the ER or ER-exit and further subcellular trafficking. Through genetic screens we identify mutations that restore defects in dimer formation and/or trafficking. Suppressors of defective dimerization restore ab initio formation of UapA dimers in the ER. Most of these suppressors are located in the movable core domain, but also in the core-dimerization interface and in residues of the dimerization domain exposed to lipids. Molecular Dynamics suggest the majority of suppressors stabilize interhelical interactions in the core domain and thus assist the formation of functional UapA dimers. Among suppressors restoring dimerization, a specific mutation, T401P, was also isolated independently as a suppressor restoring trafficking, suggesting that stabilization of the core domain restores function by sustaining structural defects caused by abolishment of essential interactions with specific or annular lipids. Importantly, introduction of mutations topologically equivalent to T401P into a rat homologue of UapA, namely rSNBT1, permitted the functional expression of a mammalian NAT in A. nidulans. Thus, our results provide a potential route for the functional expression and manipulation of mammalian transporters in the model Aspergillus system.","Since the emergence of CoVID-19 pandemic in China in late 2019, scientists are striving hard to explore non-toxic, viable anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds or medicines. We determined In Vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of oral formulations (syrup and capsule) of an Iodine-complex (Renessans). A monolayer of vero cells were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in the presence and absence of different concentrations (equivalent to 50, 05 and 0.5 \u03bcg/ml of I2) of Renessans. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of each of the formulation was assessed in the form of cell survival, SARS-CoV-2-specific cytopathic effect (CPE) and genome quantization. With varying concentrations of syrup and capsule, a varying rate of inhibition of CPE, cells survival and virus replication was observed. Compared to 0.5 \u03bcg/ml concentration of Renessans syrup, 5 and 50 \u03bcg/ml showed comparable results where there was a 100% cell survival, no CPEs and a negligible viral replication (\u0394CT= 0.11 and 0.13, respectively). This study indicates that Renessans, containing iodine, may have potential activity against SARS-CoV-2 which needs to be further investigated in human clinical trials.","Mass Spectrometry imaging (MS imaging) provides spatial information for a wide range of compound classes in different sample matrices. We used MS imaging to investigate the distribution of components in fresh and processed food, including meat, dairy and bakery products. The MS imaging workflow was optimized to cater to the specific properties and challenges of the individual samples. We successfully detected highly nonpolar and polar constituents such as beta-carotene and anthocyanins, respectively. For the first time, the distribution of a contaminant and a food additive was visualized in processed food. We detected acrylamide in German gingerbread and investigated the penetration of the preservative natamycin into cheese. For this purpose, a new data analysis tool was developed to study the penetration of analytes from uneven surfaces. Our results show that MS imaging has great potential in food analysis to provide relevant information about components\u2019 distributions, particularly those underlying official regulations.","Objective The study intended to understand the effect of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on western Indian elderly care homes. The study aimed to know the actions taken by administration of homes and challenges faced during the lockdown period.","The confirmed number of SARS-CoV-2 infections up to 30 August 2021 is 217 mil. worldwide but information about factors affecting the probability of infection or of a severe course of Covid-19 remains insufficient and often speculative. Only a small number of factors have been rigorously examined, mostly by retrospective or cross-sectional studies. We ran a preregistered study on 5,164 internet users who shared with us information about their exposure to 105 risk factors and reported being Covid negative before the beginning of the fourth wave of Covid-19 in the Czech Republic. After the fourth wave, in which 709 (13.7%) of participants were infected, we used a partial Kendall test controlled for sex, age, and urbanisation to compare the risk of infection and of a severe course of the disease in subjects who originally did and did not report exposure to particular risk factors. After the correction for multiple tests, we identified 13 factors \u2013 including male sex, lower age, blood group B, and the larger household size \u2013 that increased the risk of infection and 16 factors \u2013 including mask wearing, borreliosis in the past, use of vitamin D supplements, or rooibos drinking \u2013 that decreased it. We also identified 23 factors that increased the risk of a severe course of Covid-19 and 12 factors that decreased the risk.","Objective To evaluate the efficacy of ivermectin (IVM) as an addition to the standard of care (SOC) treatment in COVID-19 patients with mild and moderate disease","Background The increasing burden of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in the ageing population of industrialized nations requires an intensive search for means of reducing this epidemic. In order to improve prevention, detection, therapy and prognosis of cardiovascular diseases on the population level in Eastern Germany, it is necessary to examine reasons for the East-West gradient of CVD morbidity and mortality, potential causal mechanisms and prognostic factors in the elderly. Psychosocial and nutritional factors have previously been discussed as possible causes for the unexplained part of the East-West gradient. A reduced heart rate variability appears to be associated with cardiovascular disease as well as with psychosocial and other cardiovascular risk factors and decreases with age. Nevertheless, there is a lack of population-based data to examine the role of heart rate variability and its interaction with psychosocial and nutritional factors regarding the effect on cardiovascular disease in the ageing population. There also is a paucity of epidemiological data describing the health situation in Eastern Germany. Therefore, we conduct a population-based study to examine the distribution of CVD, heart rate variability and CVD risk factors and their associations in an elderly East German population. This paper describes the design and objectives of the CARLA Study. Methods/design For this study, a random sample of 45-80 year-old inhabitants of the city of Halle (Saale) in Eastern Germany was drawn from the population registry. By the end of the baseline examination (2002-2005), 1750 study participants will have been examined. A multi-step recruitment strategy aims at achieving a 70 % response rate. Detailed information is collected on own and family medical history, socioeconomic, psychosocial, behavioural and biomedical factors. Medical examinations include anthropometric measures, blood pressure of arm and ankle, a 10-second and a 20-minute electrocardiogram, a general physical examination, an echocardiogram, and laboratory analyses of venous blood samples. On 200 participants, a 24-hour electrocardiogram is recorded. A detailed system of quality control ensures high data quality. A follow-up examination is planned. Discussion This study will help to elucidate pathways to CVD involving autonomic dysfunction and lifestyle factors which might be responsible for the CVD epidemic in some populations.","Die labordiagnostische Untersuchung stellt eine wichtige Moglichkeit zur Beurteilung und Optimierung der Leistungs- und Regenerationsfahigkeit professioneller Athleten dar.

Durch eine Periodisierung der laborchemischen Untersuchungen, mit zumindest zwei Labordiagnostiken im Jahr, und Aufstellung individueller Variabilitats- und Referenzbereiche kann ferner eine bessere Beurteilbarkeit erreicht werden.","BACKGROUND A key trial (NCT04308668) of post-exposure prophylaxis found hydroxychloroquine-associated (HCQ) reductions of Covid-19 by 17% overall and 31% to 49% in subgroups. To understand these trends, we re-analyzed the dataset.","","Background Many nutrients have powerful immunomodulatory actions with the potential to alter susceptibility to COVID-19 infection, progression to symptoms, likelihood of severe disease and survival. The pandemic has fostered many nutrition-related theories, sometimes backed by a biased interpretation of evidence.","  It is known that the primary source of dietary vitamin C is fruit and\nvegetables and the plasma level of vitamin C has been considered a good\nsurrogate biomarker of vitamin C intake by fruit and vegetable consumption. To\ncombine the information about association between vitamin C intake and the\nplasma level of vitamin C, numerical approximation methods for likelihood\nfunction of correlation coefficient are studied. The least squares approach is\nused to estimate a log-likelihood function by a function from a space of\nB-splines having desirable mathematical properties. The likelihood interval\nfrom the Highest Likelihood Regions (HLR) is used for further inference. This\napproach can be easily extended to the realm of meta-analysis involving sample\ncorrelations from different studies by use of an approximated combined\nlikelihood function. The sample correlations between vitamin C intake and serum\nlevel of vitamin C from many studies are used to illustrate application of this\napproach.\n","Background Crocin I and II are derived from the medicinal plant Crocus sativus L. (Saffron), and their neuroprotective effects have been attracting more and more attention. However, their protective effect against cerebral apoplexy induced by hypoxia has not been reported. In this study, we aimed to clarify the roles of crocin I and II in protecting against ischemic injury.","Although a vast knowledge has already been gathered on the pathophysiology of COVID-19, there are still limited, non-optimal treatment options. In this paper, we describe a multicentre, retrospective, observational study to describe the course of SARS-CoV-2 disease in patients treated with ImmunoFormulation (IF), an add-on therapy developed to decrease duration of clinical symptoms. In parallel, a group of patients that did not receive IF was used for comparison (using standard of care treatment). A total of 39 patients were evaluated. Throughout the observational period, 90% of patients recovered in the IF cohort and 47.4% in the Control cohort (p=0.0057). From the symptoms with statistically significant differences, the duration of symptoms (i.e., the time to recover from it) was shorter in the IF cohort than in control cohort (in days, average), especially for fever (2.25 x 21.78), dry cough (4.38 x 24.00), dyspnoea (3.67 x 20.00), headache (2.00 x 26.50), diarrhoea (5.25 x 25.25), and weakness (1.92 x 23.30). This demonstrates a potential promising role of IF as adjuvant therapy on the evolution of symptomatology to COVID-19 patients.","  Typical fact verification models use retrieved written evidence to verify\nclaims. Evidence sources, however, often change over time as more information\nis gathered and revised. In order to adapt, models must be sensitive to subtle\ndifferences in supporting evidence. We present VitaminC, a benchmark infused\nwith challenging cases that require fact verification models to discern and\nadjust to slight factual changes. We collect over 100,000 Wikipedia revisions\nthat modify an underlying fact, and leverage these revisions, together with\nadditional synthetically constructed ones, to create a total of over 400,000\nclaim-evidence pairs. Unlike previous resources, the examples in VitaminC are\ncontrastive, i.e., they contain evidence pairs that are nearly identical in\nlanguage and content, with the exception that one supports a given claim while\nthe other does not. We show that training using this design increases\nrobustness -- improving accuracy by 10% on adversarial fact verification and 6%\non adversarial natural language inference (NLI). Moreover, the structure of\nVitaminC leads us to define additional tasks for fact-checking resources:\ntagging relevant words in the evidence for verifying the claim, identifying\nfactual revisions, and providing automatic edits via factually consistent text\ngeneration.\n","Background. Thiobarbituric reacting substances (TBARS) are markers of lipoperoxidation. The best-known specific TBARS is malondialdehyde (MDA). Results from our previous studies have shown that TBARS can be measured in saliva and are increased in patients with gingivitis. Whether MDA is the main TBARS in saliva from patients with altered parodontal status is unknown. Aim. To observe the relationship between the parodontal status and TBARS, MDA and the number of epithelial cells in saliva. Subjects &amp; Methods. In Study I saliva and plasma samples of 15 patients (8F, 7M) suffering from inflammatory periodontal diseases were gathered and TBARS levels were measured in these samples. In Study II saliva samples from 217 consecutive stomatologic patients were collected and analysed for TBARS spectrofluorometrically, MDA by high-performance liquid chromatography and epithelial cell count by light microscopy. Papillary bleeding index (PBI) was determined in standard stomatologic examination. Results. In Study I results from our previous studies showing no correlation between salivary and plasma TBARS levels were confirmed. This indicates that the local salivary level of TBARS is unlikely to be directly affected by systemic oxidative stress. In Study II higher PBI was associated independently (adjusted for age and sex) tightly with higher TBARS (p &lt; 0.001) and with lower number of epithelial cells in saliva (p &lt; 0.05). Smokers had higher salivary MDA levels (p &lt; 0.003) and lower number of epithelial cells in saliva (p &lt; 0.01). Conclusion. Salivary TBARS are a simple parameter that partially reflects the parodontal status with a potential usefulness in the clinical stomatology. We show herein that salivary MDA is dependent on age and smoking, but there is no correlation between MDA and PBI. Further studies should uncover the main salivary TBARS compound in patients with altered parodontal status and trace the origin of these salivary lipoperoxidation markers.","This work details the study of critical containment zones in Maharashtra within a time (April 9 2020 - July 31 2020) in the context of COVID-19. The effects of lockdown implementation, community isolation, environmental factors, demographic aspects, behavioural factors, diet etc. have been investigated. The effect of the aforementioned factors on the infected cases, cumulative infected cases, recoveries, cumulative recoveries, active cases, deaths and cumulative deaths are analyzed. The integrated effects of the aforementioned factors on COVID-19 outcomes are further amplified due to adequate and inadequate health facilities. The study will be helpful to scientists, researchers, pharmacists and biotechnologists in new vaccine design &amp; to accommodate above factors for the betterment of susceptible &amp; infected people of Maharashtra and similar demographies across the globe. Further, it pinpoints the need for more awareness and control strategies among the people to reduce the havoc, stress, fear, anxiety, pathogenicity and thereby reducing mortality.","Over 95% of the COVID-19 cases are mild-to-asymptomatic who contribute to disease transmission whereas most of the severe manifestations of the disease are observed in elderly and in patients with comorbidities and dysregulation of immune response has been implicated in severe clinical outcomes. However, it is unclear whether asymptomatic or mild infections are due to low viral load or lack of inflammation. We have measured the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the respiratory samples and serum markers of inflammation in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms. We observed a bi-phasic pattern of virus load which was eventually cleared in most patients at the time of discharge. Viral load in saliva samples from a subset of patients showed good correlation with nasopharyngeal samples. Serum interferon levels were downregulated during early stages of infection but peaked at later stages correlating with elevated levels of T-cell cytokines and other inflammatory mediators such as IL-6 and TNF- \u03b1 which showed a bi-phasic pattern. The clinical recovery of patients correlated with decrease in viral load and increase in interferons and other cytokines which indicates an effective innate and adaptive immune function in mild infections. We further characterized one of the SARS-CoV-2 isolate by plaque purification and show that infection of lung epithelial cells (Calu-3) with this isolate led to cytopathic effect disrupting epithelial barrier function and tight junctions. Finally we showed that zinc was capable of inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection in this model suggesting a beneficial effect of zinc supplementation in COVID-19 infection.","Background Observational studies have demonstrated inverse associations between vegetable intake and cardiovascular diseases. However, the results are prone to residual confounding. The separate effects of cooked and raw vegetable intake remain unclear. This study aims to investigate the association between cooked and raw vegetable intake with cardiovascular outcomes using Mendelian randomization (MR).","Background SARS-CoV-2 entry into type II pneumocytes is depended on the TMPRSS2 proteolytic enzyme. The only known promoter of TMPRSS2 in humans is an androgen response element. As such, androgen sensitivity may be a risk factor for COVID-19. Previously, we have reported a retrospective cohort analysis demonstrating the protective effect of 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (5ARis) in COVID-19. Men using 5ARis were less likely to be admitted to the ICU than men not taking 5ARis. Additionally, men using 5ARis had drastically reduced frequency of symptoms compared to men not using 5ARis in an outpatient setting. Here we aim to determine if 5ARis will be a beneficial treatment if given after SARS-CoV-2 infection.","The effect of Vitamin C (Vc) in oncotherapy was controversial for decades. And hyperactivation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) drove tumorigenesis. Herein, we demonstrated that Vc activated ERK through sodium-dependent Vc transporter 2 (SVCT2), while high-dose Vc resulted in persistent ERK feedback inhibition following activation. Extracellular Vc binding to SVCT2 initiated ERK activation, then transmembrane transport of Vc induced dimerization of SVCT2. Activated ERK phosphorylated protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 12 (PTPN12) at Ser434 and inhibited PTPN12 activity, thus enhancing phosphorylation of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), which phosphorylated growth factor receptor bound protein 2 (GRB2) at Tyr160 to promote GRB2 dimers dissociation and recruitment of GRB2 to SVCT2, leading to further ERK activation. Different cancers have different sensitivities to Vc, the dose effects of Vc on cancer phenotypes depended on that ERK was activated or inhibited. These findings suggest SVCT2 is a Vc receptor mediating the ERK-PTPN12-JAK2-GRB2-ERK positive feedback loop and a potential target for oncotherapy.","New information is emerging about SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology and immunity, but little of this information comes from low- and middle-income countries or from patients receiving care in the outpatient setting. The current study investigated the SARS-CoV-2 infection status and antibody responses in 157 patients seeking care for a respiratory disease suggestive of COVID-19 in private healthcare clinics during the first wave (June\u2013October 2020) of infections in Nicaragua. We examined nasal swabs for the presence of viral RNA via RT-PCR and longitudinally collected sera for the changes in SARS-CoV-2 Spike antibody levels over six months. Among patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, we evaluated if clinical symptoms were associated with age, hematological parameters and co-morbidities. The combination of PCR and paired serology identified 60 (38%) of the 157 outpatients as acute COVID-19. While both PCR and serology identified the majority (n = 38, 64%) of the acute infections, a notable number of outpatients were identified by RT-qPCR (n = 13, 22%) or by serology (n = 9, 14%) only. During the longitudinal study, we identified 6 new infections by serology among the 97 non-COVID-19 subjects. In conclusion, this study report that more than one third of the outpatients seeking care for acute respiratory disease during the first epidemic wave of SARS-CoV-2 in Nicaragua had an acute mild COVID-19 infection that correlate with prolonged humoral response. This immune response to the RBD antigen, more likely IgG dependent, significantly increased between the acute to convalescent and decay in the late convalescent but still remained seropositive.","Dramatic rectal temperature decrease, in mice administered with a drug that specifically inhibits F1F0 ATP hydrolysis, suggests that F1F0 ATP hydrolysis is a major determinant of metabolic rate in vivo. Across twelve investigated species, less F1F0 ATP hydrolysis correlates with greater maximal lifespan. Specific drug inhibition of F1F0 ATP hydrolysis exerts potent anti-cancer activity in vitro.","Background and Purpose Vitamin A is depleted during infections. Vitamin A has been used successfully in measles, RSV and AIDS patients and is an effective vaccine adjuvant. In this study, low retinol levels were found in patients with severe COVID-19. Retinoid signaling impairment in COVID-19 disrupts Type-I interferon synthesis.","Background The novel corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been causing a massive global public health havoc. Use of quinolones for treatment of COVID-19 was a matter of huge discussion in scientific community. Falsified data about efficacy of the drug against COVID-19 disseminated. This review was designed to study the dosages of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine planned to be administered in clinical trials registered up to March 2020.","Background Previous results from observational, interventional studies and in vitro experiments suggest that certain micronutrients have anti-viral and immunomodulatory activities. In particular, it has been hypothesized that zinc, selenium, copper and vitamin K1 have strong potential for prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19.","Background Private retail pharmacies in developing countries present a unique channel for COVID-19 prevention. We assessed the response to the COVID-19 pandemic by pharmacies in Kenya, aiming to identify strategies for maximising their contribution to the national response.","The brain-gut axis is increasingly recognized as an important contributing factor in the onset and progression of severe mental illnesses such as schizophrenia spectrum disorders and bipolar disorder. This study investigates associations between levels of faecal metabolites identified using 1H-NMR, clinical parameters, and dietary components of forty-two individuals diagnosed in a transdiagnostic approach to have severe mental illness. Faecal levels of the amino acids; alanine, leucine, and valine showed a significant positive correlation with psychiatric symptom severity as well as with dairy intake. Overall, this study proposes a diet-induced link between the brain-gut axis and the severity of psychiatric symptoms, which could be valuable in the design of novel dietary or therapeutic interventions to improve psychiatric symptoms.","  We demonstrate a flexible sensor for ascorbic acid detection in sweat based\non single-step modified gold microelectrodes. The modification consists on the\nelectrodeposition of alginate membrane with trapped CuO nanoparticles on top of\nthe electrodes. The electrodes are fabricated at a thin polyimide support and\nthe soft nature of the membrane can withstand mechanical stress far beyond the\nrequirements for skin monitoring. We further show the efficient detection of\nascorbic acid at the micromolar levels in both, a neutral buffer and acidic\nartificial sweat, at ultra-low applied potential (-5 mV). The effect of\npossible interfering species present in sweat is minimized, with no observable\ncross-reaction, thus maintaining a high degree of selectivity despite absence\nof enzymes in the fabrication scheme. This sensor is envisioned as a promising\ncomponent of a wearable device for e.g. non-invasive monitoring of\nmicronutrient loss through sweat.\n","Thinking one is better than peers is generally associated with positive psychological outcomes like increased self-esteem and resilience. However, this tendency may be problematic in the context of collective action problems, wherein individuals are reliant on others\u2019 prosocial behaviors to achieve larger goals. We examined this question in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, and recruited participants (n = 1022) from a university community in Spring 2020. We found evidence for a self-peer asymmetry, such that participants reported that they were doing more to stop the spread of the disease and were more prosocially motivated than peers. Actual peer reports indicated that these were overestimations. This self-enhancement tendency comes with a cost: the perceived self-peer asymmetry mediated the relationship between Covid-specific worry and general anxiety during the early lockdown period. This indicates that while believing one is doing more than others may be maladaptive in collective action problems.","Moxifloxacin is central to treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Effects of moxifloxacin on Mycobacterium tuberculosis redox state were explored to identify strategies for increasing lethality and reducing the prevalence of extensively resistant tuberculosis. A non-invasive redox biosensor and an ROS-sensitive dye revealed that moxifloxacin induces oxidative stress correlated with M. tuberculosis death. Moxifloxacin lethality was mitigated by supplementing bacterial cultures with an ROS scavenger (thiourea), an iron chelator (bipyridyl), and, after drug removal, an antioxidant enzyme (catalase). Lethality was also reduced by hypoxia and nutrient starvation. Moxifloxacin increased the expression of genes involved in the oxidative stress response, iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis, and DNA repair. Surprisingly, and in contrast with Escherichia coli studies, moxifloxacin decreased expression of genes involved in respiration, suppressed oxygen consumption, increased the NADH/NAD+ ratio, and increased the labile iron pool in M. tuberculosis. Lowering the NADH/NAD+ ratio in M. tuberculosis revealed that NADH-reductive stress facilitates an iron-mediated ROS surge and moxifloxacin lethality. Treatment with N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) accelerated respiration and ROS production, increased moxifloxacin lethality, and lowered the mutant prevention concentration. Moxifloxacin induced redox stress in M. tuberculosis inside macrophages, and co-treatment with NAC potentiated the anti-mycobacterial efficacy of moxifloxacin during nutrient starvation, inside macrophages, and in mice where NAC restricted the emergence of resistance. Thus, oxidative stress, generated in a novel way, contributes to moxifloxacin-mediated killing of M. tuberculosis. The results open a way to make fluoroquinolones more effective anti-tuberculosis agents and provide a mechanistic basis for NAC-mediated enhancement of fluoroquinolone lethality in vitro and in vivo.","Nutrient availability varies seasonally and spatially in the wild. The resulting nutrient limitation or restricted access to nutrients pose a major challenge for every organism. While many animals, such as hibernating animals, evolved strategies to overcome periods of nutrient scarcity, the cellular mechanisms of these strategies are poorly understood. Cave environments represent an extreme example of nutrient deprived environments since the lack of sunlight and therefore primary energy production drastically diminishes the nutrient availability. Here, we used Astyanax mexicanus, which includes river-dwelling surface fish and cave adapted cavefish populations to study the genetic adaptation to nutrient limitations. We show that cavefish populations store large amounts of fat in different body regions when fed ad libitum in the lab. We found higher expression of lipogenesis genes in cavefish livers when fed the same amount of food as surface fish, suggesting an improved ability of cavefish to use lipogenesis to convert available energy into triglycerides for storage into adipose tissue. Moreover, the lipid metabolism regulator, Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (Ppar\u03b3), is upregulated at both transcript and protein levels in cavefish livers. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP seq) showed that Ppar\u03b3 binds cavefish promoter regions of genes to a higher extent than surface fish. Finally, we identified two possible regulatory mechanisms of Ppar\u03b3 in cavefish: higher amounts of ligands of the nuclear receptor, and nonsense mutations in per2, a known repressor of Ppar\u03b3. Taken together, our study reveals that upregulated Ppar\u03b3 promotes higher levels of lipogenesis in the liver and contributes to higher body fat accumulation in cavefish populations, an important adaptation to nutrient limited environments.","Background Long COVID has been a social concern. Though patient characteristics associated with developing long COVID are partially known, those associated with persisting it have not been identified.","Background AYUSH formulations have a potential role in symptomatic treatment, preventing disease progression and improving quality of life in COVID-19 patients.","Objectives Dietary supplements may provide nutrients of relevance to ameliorate SARS-CoV-2 infection, although scientific evidence to support a role is lacking. We investigate whether the regular use of dietary supplements can reduce the risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection in around 1.4M users of the COVID Symptom Study App who completed a supplement use questionnaire.","Objective This living systematic review aims to provide a timely, rigorous and continuously updated summary of the evidence available on the role of vitamin C in the treatment of patients with COVID-19.","The main obstacle in eradicating tuberculosis is the ability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to remain dormant in the host, and then to get reactivated even years later under immuno-compromised conditions. Transcriptional regulation in intracellular pathogens plays an important role in adapting to the challenging environment inside the host cells. Previously, we demonstrated that Rv1019, a putative transcriptional regulator of M. tuberculosis H37Rv, is an autorepressor. We showed that, Rv1019 is cotranscribed with Rv1020 (mfd) and Rv1021 (mazG) encoding DNA repair proteins and negatively regulates the expression of these genes. In the present study, we show that Rv1019 also regulates the expression of the genes Rv3230c and Rv3229c (desA3) which form a two-gene operon in M. tuberculosis. Constitutive expression of Rv1019 in M. tuberculosis significantly downregulated the expression of these genes. Employing Wayne\u2019s hypoxia-induced dormancy model of M. tuberculosis, we show that Rv1019 is upregulated (3-fold) under hypoxia. Finally, by reporter assay, using M. smegmatis as a model, we validate that Rv1019 is recruited to the promoter of Rv3230c-Rv3229c during hypoxia and negatively regulates this operon which is involved in the biosynthesis of oleic acid.","Background In the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, many hospitalized patients received empiric hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine (HC/CQ). Although some retrospective-observational trials suggested potential benefit, all subsequent randomized clinical trials (RCTs) failed to show benefit and use generally ceased. Herein, we summarize key studies that clinicians advising patients on HC/CQ\u2019s efficacy:safety calculus in hospitalized COVID-19 patients would want to know about in a practical one-stop-shopping source.","Endocytosis through Drosophila glia is a significant determinant of sleep amount and occurs preferentially during sleep in glia of the blood brain barrier (BBB). To identify metabolites whose trafficking is mediated by sleep-dependent endocytosis, we conducted metabolomic analysis of flies that have increased sleep due to a block in glial endocytosis. We report that acylcarnitines, molecules that conjugate with long chain fatty acids to promote their transport, accumulate in heads of these animals. In parallel, to identify transporters and receptors whose loss contributes to the sleep phenotype caused by blocked endocytosis, we screened genes enriched in barrier glia for effects on sleep. We find that knockdown of lipid transporters LRP1&amp;2 as well as carnitine transporters ORCT1&amp;2 increases sleep. In support of the idea that the block in endocytosis affects trafficking through specific transporters, knockdown of LRP or ORCT transporters also increases acylcarnitines in heads. We propose that lipid species, such as acylcarnitines, are trafficked through the BBB via sleep-dependent endocytosis, and their accumulation in the brain increases the need for sleep.","","We aimed to analyze and visualize the science map of Cochrane systematic reviews (CSR) with high Altmetric attention scores (AAS). On 10 May 2019, the Altmetric data of the CSR Database were obtained from the Altmetric database (Altmetric LLP, London, UK). Bibliometric data of the top 5% of CSR were extracted from the Web of Science. Keyword co-occurrence, co-authorship, and co-citation network analysis were then employed using VOSviewer software. A Random forest model was used to analyze the citation patterns. A total of 12016 CSR with AAS were found (Total mentions: 259968) with Twitter being the most popular Altmetric resource. Consequently, the top 5% (607 articles, mean AAS: 171.2, 95% confidence level (CL): 14.4, mean citations: 42.1, 95%CL: 1.3) with the highest AAS were included in the study. Keyword co-occurrence network analysis revealed female, adult, and child as the most popular keywords. Helen V. Worthington (University of Manchester, Manchester, UK), and the University of Oxford and UK had the greatest impact on the network at the author, organization and country levels respectively. The co-citation network analysis revealed that The Lancet and CSR database had the most influence on the network. However, AAS were not correlated with citations (r=0.15) although they were correlated with policy document mentions (r=0.61). The results of random forest model confirmed the importance of policy document mentions. Despite the popularity of CSR in the Twittersphere, disappointingly, they were rarely shared and discussed within the new academic tools that are emerging, such as F1000 prime, Publons, and PubPeer.","Background Global knowledge of treatment and outcomes of COVID-19 has been evolving since the onset of the pandemic.","Iron deficiency hampers photosynthesis and is associated with chlorosis. We recently showed that iron deficiency-induced chlorosis depends on phosphorus availability. How plants integrate these cues to control chlorophyll accumulation is unknown. Here, we show that iron limitation downregulates photosynthesis genes in a phosphorus-dependent manner. Using transcriptomics and genome-wide association analysis, we identify two genes, a chloroplastic ascorbate transporter (PHT4;4) and a nuclear transcription factor (bZIP58), which prevent the downregulation of photosynthesis genes leading to the stay-green phenotype under iron-phosphorus deficiency. Joint limitation of these nutrients induces ascorbate accumulation by activating expression of an ascorbate biosynthesis gene, VTC4, which requires bZIP58. Exogenous ascorbate prevents iron deficiency-induced chlorosis in vtc4 mutants, but not in bzip58 or pht4;4. Our study demonstrates chloroplastic ascorbate transport is essential for preventing the downregulation of photosynthesis genes under iron-phosphorus combined deficiency. These findings uncover a molecular pathway coordinating chloroplast-nucleus communication to adapt photosynthesis to nutrient availability.","Humic substances are well known human nutritional supplement materials and play important performance-enhancing roles as animal feed additives, too. For decades, ingredients of humic substances have also been proven to carry potent antiviral effects against different viruses. Here, the antiviral activity of a humic substance containing ascorbic acid, Se- and Zn2+ ions intended as a nutritional supplement material was investigated against SARS-CoV-2 virus B1.1.7 Variant of Concern (\u201cAlpha Variant\u201d) in a VeroE6 cell line. Results show that this combination has a significant in vitro antiviral effect at a very low concentration range of its intended active ingredients. Even picomolar concentration ranges of humic substances, vitamin C and Zn/Se ions in the given composition were enough to achieve fifty percent viral replication inhibition in the applied SARS-CoV-2 virus inhibition test.","","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus. There are three phases of COVID-19: early infection stage, pulmonary stage and hyper-inflammation stage respectively. It is important to prevent lung or other organs injuries by preventing phase-II and phase-III via pharmacological or non-pharmacological treatments. This was a case series study done on twenty-two patients confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and diagnosed with COVID-19. Patients in this study have been used quercetin 800 mg, bromelain 165 mg, zinc acetate 50 mg and ascorbic acid 1 g once daily as supplements for 3 to 5 days during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of quercetin, bromelain, zinc and ascorbic acid combination supplements on patients with COVID-19. The mean levels of WBC, ANC, ALC, AMC and AST were normal among all included patients before and after taking quercetin, bromelain, zinc and ascorbic acid supplements (P-value &gt; 0.05). Quercetin 800 mg, bromelain 165 mg, zinc acetate 50 mg and ascorbic acid 1 g once daily supplements were safe for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and may prevent poor prognosis. Randomized clinical trials needed in the future to ensure the efficacy of quercetin, bromelain, zinc and vitamin c combination.","Background While there was a lack of pharmacological interventions proven to be effective in early, outpatient settings for COVID-19, in a prospective, open-label observational study (pre-AndroCoV Trial) the use of nitazoxanide, ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine demonstrated similar effects, and apparent improvement of outcomes compared to untreated patients. The unexpected apparent positive results led to ethical questions on the employment of further full placebo-control studies in early stage COVID-19. The objective of the present study was to elucidate whether the conduction of a full placebo-control RCT was still ethically viable, through a comparative analysis with two control-groups.","Abstract Well-curated datasets are essential to evidence based decision making and to the integration of artificial intelligence with human reasoning across disciplines. However, many sources of data remain siloed, unstructured, and/or unavailable for complementary and secondary research. Sysrev was developed to address these issues. First, Sysrev was built to aid in systematic evidence reviews (SER), where digital documents are evaluated according to a well defined process, and where Sysrev provides an easy to access, publicly available and free platform for collaborating in SER projects. Secondly, Sysrev addresses the issue of unstructured, siloed, and inaccessible data in the context of generalized data extraction, where human and machine learning algorithms are combined to extract insights and evidence for better decision making across disciplines. Sysrev uses FAIR - Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse of digital assets - as primary principles in design. Sysrev was developed primarily because of an observed need to reduce redundancy, reduce inefficient use of human time and increase the impact of evidence based decision making. This publication is an introduction to Sysrev as a novel technology, with an overview of the features, motivations and use cases of the tool.","Background A glycerol throat spray containing cold-adapted cod trypsin (GCTS) deactivates common cold virus in vitro and decreases pharyngeal rhinovirus load after inoculation in humans. We relied on early self-diagnosis and evaluated two different scales to detect a treatment effect in naturally occurring common colds.","Purpose The aim of this study was to investigate the association of anxiety and depression symptoms with health related quality of life (HRQoL) and sleep quality in patients with beta-thalassemia. Methods In a cross-sectional study between 2006 and 2007, 292 thalassemic patients were assessed for symptoms of anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale; HADS), HRQoL (Short Form-36, SF-36) and quality of sleep (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; PSQI). Linear regression models were used to determine possible predictive value of high anxiety and depressive symptoms on HRQoL and sleep quality, separately. Results Mental and physical quality of life scores were predicted by symptoms of depression and somatic comorbidities. Total sleep quality was predicted by anxiety symptoms and somatic comorbidities. Conclusions Screening for anxiety and depression in patients with thalassemia is essential. Further studies should test if appropriate treatment of these conditions may improve patients HRQoL and sleep quality or not. ","It is widely accepted that cAMP regulates gene transcription principally by activating the protein kinase A (PKA)-targeted transcription factors. Here, we show that cAMP enhances the generation of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in multiple cell types. 5hmC is converted from 5-methylcytosine (5mC) by Tet methylcytosine dioxygenases, for which Fe(II) is an essential cofactor. The promotion of 5hmC was mediated by a prompt increase of the intracellular labile Fe(II) pool (LIP). cAMP enhanced the acidification of endosomes for Fe(II) release to the LIP likely through RapGEF2. The effect of cAMP on Fe(II) and 5hmC was confirmed by adenylate cyclase activators, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, and most notably by stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). The transcriptomic changes caused by cAMP occurred in concert with 5hmC elevation in differentially transcribed genes. Collectively, these data show a previously unrecognized regulation of gene transcription by GPCR-cAMP signaling through augmentation of the intracellular labile Fe(II) pool and DNA demethylation.","The SEN virus (SENV) has been linked to transfusion-associated non-A-E hepatitis; however, information regarding SENV infections in patients with thalassemia, particularly in those with hepatitis virus co-infections, remains limited. This study investigated the frequency of SENV (genotypes D and H) infections in Iraqi patients with thalassemia who were and were not infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). The study involved 150 \u03b2-thalessemia patients (75 with HCV infections and 75 without) and 75 healthy blood donors. Patient levels of vitamins C and E, liver function markers, and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) were determined. Recovered viral nucleic acids were amplified using the conventional polymerase chain reaction (SENV DNA) or the real-time polymerase chain reaction (HCV RNA) techniques. Only 10% of healthy donors had evidence of SENV infection. Among patients with thalassemia, 80% and 77% of patients with and without concurrent HCV infections, respectively, had SENV infections. DNA sequencing analyses were performed on blood samples obtained from 29 patients. Patients with thalassemia, particularly those with SENV infections, had higher levels of several enzymatic liver function markers and total serum bilirubin (P &lt; 0.05) than did healthy blood donors. Among the examined liver function markers, only gamma-glutamyl transferase demonstrated significantly higher levels in HCV-negative patients infected with SENV-H than in those infected with SENV-D (P = 0.01). There were significantly lower vitamin C, vitamin E, and glutathione peroxidase levels in patients than in healthy donors (P &lt; 0.05), but only glutathione peroxidase levels were significantly lower in HCV-negative thalassemia patients infected with SENV than in those without SENV infections (P = 0.04). The SENV-H genotype sequences were similar to the global standard genes in GenBank. These results increase our understanding of the nature of the SENV-H genotype and the differential role of SENV-H infections, compared to SENV-D infections, in patients with thalassemia, in Iraq.","Intact glucosinolate (GSL) profile (five aliphatic; three aromatic, and one indolic glucosinolate) in the leaves of 50 germplasm collections and commercial cultivars of Brassica rapa, Brassica juncea, and Brassica oleracea collected from six different countries and grown under uniform cultural conditions were compared by UPLC-MS/MS. Total GSLs content ranged from 36.80 to 2383.12 \u03bcmol/kg DW. Aliphatic GSLs predominated among the entire samples representing from 23.0 to 98.9% of the total GSLs content, where gluconapin and glucobrassicanapin contributed the greatest proportion. Other GSLs such as, progoitrin (PRO), glucotropaeolin (TRO), and glucobarbarin (BAR) were found in relatively low concentrations. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) yielded three principal components with eigenvalue \u2265 1, representing 70.33% of the total variation across the entire data set. Accessions IT260822 &amp; IT32750, and commercial cultivar, \u201cHangamssam2\u201d, were well distinguished from other samples in the PCA plot due to their significantly high amount of BAR, glucobrassicin (GBC), and glucoerucin (ERU), respectively. The inter- and intra-leaf variations of GSLs were examined in three kimichi cabbage varieties. The GSLs content varied significantly among leaves in different positions (outer, middle, and inner) and sections within the leaves (top, middle, bottom, green/red, and white). Higher GSL contents were observed in the proximal half &amp; white section of the leaves and inner positions (younger leaves) in most of the samples. GBC, gluconasturtiin (NAS), and glucoberteroin (BER) should be studied profusely in Brassica plants as some of their degradation products of GBC and NAS are useful in cancer chemopreventive functions, whereas BER takes part in the process of suppressing aging of the skin. GSLs are regarded as allelochemicals; hence, the data related to the patterns of GSLs within the leaf and between leaves at different position could be useful to understand the defense mechanism of Brassica plants. The observed variability could be useful for breeders to develop Brassica crops with high GSL content or specific profiles of GSLs as required.","Food environments can profoundly impact diet and related diseases. Effective, robust measures of food environment nutritional quality are required by researchers and policymakers investigating their effects on individual dietary behavior and designing targeted public health interventions. The most commonly used indicators of food environment nutritional quality are limited to measuring the binary presence or absence of entire categories of food outlet type, such as \u2018fast-food\u2019 outlets, which can range from burger joints to salad chains. This work introduces a summarizing indicator of restaurant nutritional quality that exists along a continuum, and which can be applied at scale to make distinctions between diverse restaurants within and across categories of food outlets. Verified nutrient data for a set of over 500 chain restaurants is used as ground-truth data to validate the approach. We illustrate the use of the validated indicator to characterize food environments at the scale of an entire jurisdiction, demonstrating how making distinctions between different shades of nutritiousness can help to uncover hidden patterns of disparities in access to high nutritional quality food.","Background Prevention of coronavirus (COVID-19) regarding households has many aspects, such as buying masks, hand sanitizer, face shield, and many others. As a result of buying the previous items, the household spending per month will be increase during the COVID-19 pandemic period.","Infection with SARS-CoV-2 has highly variable clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic infection through to life-threatening disease. Host whole blood transcriptomics can offer unique insights into the biological processes underpinning infection and disease, as well as severity. We performed whole blood RNA Sequencing of individuals with varying degrees of COVID-19 severity. We used differential expression analysis and pathway enrichment analysis to explore how the blood transcriptome differs between individuals with mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19, performing pairwise comparisons between groups. Increasing COVID-19 severity was characterised by an abundance of inflammatory immune response genes and pathways, including many related to neutrophils and macrophages, in addition to an upregulation of immunoglobulin genes. Our insights into COVID-19 severity reveal the role of immune dysregulation in the progression to severe disease and highlight the need for further research exploring the interplay between SARS-CoV-2 and the inflammatory immune response.","Patients with underlying diseases and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are at increased risk of death. Using the recommended anti-COVID-19 drug, chloroquine phosphate (CQ), to treat patients with severe cases and type 2 diabetes (T2D) could potentially cause harm. We aimed to understand the safety of CQ in patients with T2D by administrating the recommended dose (63 mg/kg twice daily for 7 days) and a high dose (126 mg/kg twice daily for 7 days) of CQ in T2D rats. We found that CQ increased the total mortality of the T2D rats from 27.3% to 72.7% in the recommended and high-dose groups during the whole period. CQ also induced hematotoxicity of T2D rats in the high-dose group; the hepatic enzymes in T2D rats were significantly elevated. CQ also changed the electrocardiograms, prolonged the QTc intervals, and produced urinary leukocytes and proteins in the T2D rats. Histopathological observations revealed that CQ caused severe damage to the rats' heart, jejunum, liver, kidneys, spleen, and retinas. Furthermore, CQ significantly decreased the serum IL-1b and IL-6 levels. In conclusion, the CQ dosage and regimen used to treat COVID-19 induced adverse effects in diabetic rats, suggesting the need to reevaluate the effective dose of CQ in humans. Graphical abstract ","","Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) are under strict control by the host surveillance system but can become awakened under pathological conditions. Among them, the HERVK family, comprised of the evolutionarily youngest HERVs, is able to transcribe viral genes and producing retrovirus-like particles (RVLPs). However, whether HERVK is mobilized in the aging process and contributes to aging-related pathologies is largely unknown. Using diverse senescence models, we show that epigenetic alterations unlock HERVK expression, which leads to the formation of RVLPs. Derepression of HERVK promotes cellular senescence, while inhibiting HERVK prevents cellular senescence. HERVK RVLPs released from senescent cells or aged individuals are capable of conferring a senescence phenotype to young cells. Conversely, using antibodies to block the HERVK RVLPs abrogates their transmissible pro-senescence effect. Moreover, endogenous retrovirus expression is increased in aged human tissues and serum from the elderly. These findings indicate that the activation of endogenous viruses is part of the driving force of aging.","Objectives This study aimed to analyse the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of critical COVID-19 cases and investigate risk factors including comorbidities and age in relation with the clinical aftermath of COVID-19 in critical cases in Bangladesh.","The capacity to generate functional hepatocytes from renewable human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) could address limited supplies of primary human hepatocytes. However, hepatocytes differentiated from hPSCs in vitro are functionally immature. To understand mechanisms regulating maturation of in vitro derived hepatocytes, we developed a 3D spheroid differentiation system and compared gene regulatory elements in uncultured human primary hepatocytes with those in hepatocytes that were differentiated in 2D or 3D conditions from human PSCs by RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and H3K27Ac ChIP-seq. Three-dimensional differentiation improved enhancer activity and expression of transcription factor ONECUT1, but was insufficient to upregulate human-specific mature hepatocytes marker gene CYP3A4 or super-enhancer regulated transcription factor gene NFIC. Regulome comparisons showed reduced enrichment of thyroid receptor THRB motifs in accessible chromatin and in active enhancers without reduced transcription of THRB, suggesting the regulation at the level of THRB ligands in PSC-differentiated hepatocytes. Addition of thyroid hormone T3 to the PSC-differentiated hepatocytes increased CYP3A4 expression. T3 increased binding of THRB to the CYP3A4 proximal enhancer and restored the super-enhancer status and gene expression of NFIC and reduced expression of AFP. The resultant hPSC-hepatocytes showed gene expression, epigenetic status and super-enhancer landscape closer to primary hepatocytes and activated regulatory regions including non-coding SNPs associated with liver-related diseases. Transplanting the 3D PSC-hepatocytes into immunocompromised mice resulted in engraftment of human hepatocytes in the mouse liver parenchyma without disrupting normal liver histology at 6 months after transplantation. This work provides insights into the functions of nuclear receptor THRB and highlights the importance of the environmental factors-nuclear receptors axis in regulating maturation of human PSC-differentiated cell types.","Despite the accumulating evidence that increased consumption of ultra-processed food has adverse health implications, it remains difficult to decide what constitutes processed food. Indeed, the current processing-based classification of food has limited coverage and does not differentiate between degrees of processing, hindering consumer choices and slowing research on the health implications of processed food. Here we introduce a machine learning algorithm that accurately predicts the degree of processing for any food, indicating that over 73% of the U.S. food supply is ultra-processed. We show that the increased reliance of an individual\u2019s diet on ultra-processed food correlates with higher risk of metabolic syndrome, diabetes, angina, elevated blood pressure and biological age, and reduces the bio-availability of vitamins. Finally, we find that replacing foods with less processed alternatives can significantly reduce the health implications of ultra-processed food, suggesting that access to information on the degree of processing, currently unavailable to consumers, could improve population health.","Successful antibiotic treatment of infections relies on accurate and rapid identification of the infectious agents. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is implicated in a wide range of human infections that almost complicated and become life threating especially in immunocompromised and critically ill patients. Conventional microbiological methods take more than 3 days to obtain accurate results. Pyocyanin is a distinctive electroactive biomarker for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Here, we have developed a rapid diagnostic (polyaniline) PANI gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) modified indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode that showed 100% sensitivity for pyocyanin in culture of Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates and high selectivity for pyocyanin at low concentration when measured in the presence of other substances like ascorbic acid, uric acid, and glucose as interferences. The constructed electrode was characterized using scanning electron microscopy and cyclic voltammetry. The determined linear range for pyocyanin detection was from 238 \u00b5M to 1.9 \u00b5M with a detection limit of 500 nM. Compared to the screen-printed electrode used before, the constructed electrode showed a 4-fold enhanced performance.","Little is known about how normal variation in dietary patterns in humans affects the aging process, largely because both nutrition and the physiology of aging are highly complex and multidimensional. Here, we apply the nutritional geometry framework to data from 1560 older adults followed over four years to assess how nutrient intake patterns affect the aging process. Aging was quantified via blood biomarkers integrated to measure loss of homeostasis. Additionally, we extend nutritional geometry to 19 micronutrients. Salient results include benefits of intermediate protein and vitamin E intake. Broadly, we show that there are few simple answers of \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d nutrients \u2013 optimal levels are generally intermediate, but dependent on other nutrients. Simpler linear/univariate analytical approaches are insufficient to capture such associations. We present an interactive tool to explore the results, and our approach presents a roadmap for future studies to explore the full complexity of the nutrition-aging landscape.","Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) can be expanded in vitro in different culture conditions, resulting in a spectrum of cell states with distinct properties. Understanding how PSCs transition from one state to another, ultimately leading to lineage-specific differentiation, is important for developmental biology and regenerative medicine. Although there is significant information regarding gene expression changes controlling these transitions, less is known about post-translational modifications of proteins. Protein crotonylation is a newly discovered post-translational modification where lysine residues are modified with a crotonyl group. Here, we employed affinity purification of crotonylated peptides and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to systematically profile protein crotonylation in mouse PSCs in different states including ground, metastable and primed state, as well as metastable PSCs undergoing early pluripotency exit. We successfully identified 3628 high-confidence sites in 1426 proteins. These crotonylated proteins are enriched for factors involved in functions related to pluripotency such as RNA biogenesis, central carbon metabolism and proteasome function. Moreover, we found that increasing the cellular levels of crotonyl-CoA through crotonic acid treatment promotes proteasome activity in metastable PSCs and delays their differentiation, consistent with previous observations showing that enhanced proteasomal activity helps to sustain pluripotency. Our atlas of protein crotonylation will be valuable for further studies of pluripotency regulation and may also provide insights into the role of metabolism in other cell fate transitions.","Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies enable a better understanding of previously unexplored biological diversity. Oftentimes, researchers are specifically interested in modeling the latent structures and variations enriched in one target scRNA-seq dataset as compared to another background dataset generated from sources of variation irrelevant to the task at hand. For example, we may wish to isolate factors of variation only present in measurements from patients with a given disease as opposed to those shared with data from healthy control subjects. Here we introduce Contrastive Variational Inference (contrastiveVI; https://github.com/suinleelab/contrastiveVI), a framework for end-to-end analysis of target scRNA-seq datasets that decomposes the variations into shared and target-specific factors of variation. On four target-background dataset pairs, we apply contrastiveVI to perform a number of standard analysis tasks, including visualization, clustering, and differential expression testing, and we consistently achieve results that agree with known biological ground truths.","Since the declaration of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, patients with migraine were specifically vulnerable to worsening of their headaches. Traditional medicine (TM) has been used to treat headache disorders for centuries, especially during times of a healthcare emergencies, similar to the current pandemic. We aimed to assess the use of TM in treatment of migraine amid COVID-19 pandemic in Kuwait, using an online, self-administered questionnaire. A total of 1018 patients completed the survey. TM was used by 39.9% respondents. The greatest users of TM were those with older age (p =0.04), and longer disease duration (p =0.005). TM users were found to be more compliant to treatments than non-TM users (p&lt;0.02). However, they reported significantly less communication with their physicians (p &lt;0.001) during the pandemic. This study showed higher rates of TM use, as a way of self-treatment, among patients with migraine during COVID-19 pandemic. Neurologists should prepare their patients with \u201crescue\u201d strategies for headache management, and new means of communication, to face these \u201cnew normal\u201d challenges.","Despite the well-established role of nuclear organization in gene expression regulation, little is known about the reverse: how transcription shapes the spatial organization of the genome. Owing to small sizes of most previously studied genes and the limited resolution of microscopy, the structure and spatial arrangement of a single transcribed gene are still poorly understood. Here, we make use of several long highly expressed genes and demonstrate that they form transcription loops with polymerases moving along the loops and carrying nascent RNAs. Transcription loops can span across microns resembling lampbrush loops and polytene puffs. Extension and shape of transcription loops suggest their intrinsic stiffness, which we attribute to decoration with multiple voluminous nascent RNPs. Our data contradict the model of transcription factories and indicate that although microscopically resolvable transcription loops are specific for long highly expressed genes, the mechanisms underlying their formation can represent a general aspect of eukaryotic transcription.","Computational Drug Repositioning aims at ranking and selecting existing drugs for use in novel diseases or existing diseases for which these drugs were not originally designed. Using vast amounts of available omic data in digital form within an in silico screening has the potential for speeding up considerably the shortlisting of promising candidates in response to outbreaks of diseases such as COVID-19 for which no satisfactory cure has yet been found. We describe DrugMerge as a methodology for preclinical computational drug repositioning based on merging multiple drug rankings obtained with an ensemble of Disease Active Subnetwork construction algorithms. DrugMerge uses differential transcriptomic data from cell lines/tissues of patients affected by the disease and differential transcriptomic data from drug perturbation assays, in the context of a large gene co-expression network. Experiments with four benchmark diseases (Asthma, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Prostate Cancer, and Colorectal Cancer) demonstrate that our method detects in first position drugs in clinical use for the specified disease, in all four cases. Our method is competitive with the state-of-the-art tools such as CMAP (Connectivity Map). Application of DrugMerge to COVID-19 data found rankings with many drugs currently in clinical trials for COVID-19 in top positions, thus showing that DrugMerge is able to mimic human expert judgment.","","Malnutrition has been reported in alcohol use disorder patients as having a possible influence on cognitive function. The aim of this study was to analyse the prevalence of ascorbic acid (AA) deficiency in inpatients admitted for alcohol detoxification and the associated factors, including cognitive impairment in the early period of abstinence. A retrospective chart review was conducted. The AA level was categorised into three groups: deficiency (AAD) (&lt;2 mg/L), insufficiency (AAI) (2-5 mg/L) and normal level. The cognitive impairment was screened using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Ninety-six patients were included (74 men; mean age 49.1 years (+-11.5)). Twenty-seven AAD (28.1%) and twenty-two AAI (22.9%) were observed. In multivariate analysis, risk factors for AAD versus normal AA level were men (OR 17.8, 95%CI (1.63-194)), compensated cirrhosis (OR 9.35, 95%CI (1.60-54.6)) and street homelessness (OR 5.76, 95%CI (1.24-26.8) versus personal housing). The MoCA score was available for 53 patients (mean MoCA score: 25.7 (+-3.3)). In multivariate analysis, the natural logarithm of AA (b = 1.18, p = 0.037) and sedative use disorder (b = -2.77, p = 0.046) were associated with the MoCA score. AAD and AAI are frequent in inpatients admitted for alcohol detoxification. A low level of AA was associated with cognitive impairment in the early period of abstinence. ","Impaired hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism are hallmarks of type\u20132 diabetes. Increased sulfide production from cysteine, or sulfide\u2013donor compounds, may beneficially regulate hepatic metabolism. Disposal of sulfide through the sulfide oxidation pathway (SOP) is critical for maintaining sulfide within a safe physiological range. We show that mice lacking the liver\u2013enriched mitochondrial SOP enzyme thiosulfate sulfur\u2013transferase (Tst\u2212/\u2212 mice) exhibit high circulating sulfide, increased gluconeogenesis, hypertriglyceridemia and fatty liver, despite whole\u2013body insulin\u2013sensitisation. Unexpectedly, hepatic sulfide levels were normal in Tst\u2212/\u2212 mice, a result of homeostatic induction of mitochondrial sulfide disposal and glutathione excretion associated with net suppression of protein persulfidation and nuclear respiratory factor\u20132 target proteins. Proteomic and persulfidomic profiling converged on gluconeogenesis and hepatic lipid metabolism and revealed a selective deficit in medium\u2013chain fatty acid oxidation in Tst\u2212/\u2212 mice. We reveal a critical role for TST in hepatic metabolism that raises implications for sulfide-donor strategies in the context of liver function and metabolic disease.","Objectives To estimate the relationship between moderate alcohol consumption and brain health, determining the threshold intake for harm and identifying whether population subgroups are at differential risk.","Background Bromhexine hydrochloride has been suggested as a TMPRSS2 protease blocker that precludes the penetration of SARS-CoV-2 into cells. We aimed to assess the preventive potential of regular bromhexine hydrochloride intake for COVID-19 risk reduction in medical staff actively involved in the evaluation and treatment of patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection.","The first COVID-19 case in Mexico was confirmed on 26 February 2020 and by May 3 the number of registered cases had risen to 30,927. However the rate of transmission varied greatly from city to city. We used data on temperature, humidity and ultraviolet radiation (UV) from 45 cities all over the country to explore whether there was an association between these variables and rates of transmission and rates of accumulation of COVID-19 ascribed deaths. The advantage of an in-country study of this kind is that many of the variables that can confound international studies are held constant (e.g. public health policies, methods of reporting, cultural, behavioural and genetic factors). Although the official statistics undoubtedly greatly underestimate the situation in Mexico due to lack of testing, they are underestimated in all cities so this should not introduce bias across the sample. We found that temperature and humidity had no discernible association with transmission rates but that UV during the transmission period was negatively correlated with rates of transmission, suggesting a sterilizing effect. UV in the January preceding the epidemic had a slightly higher association with transmission rates than UV during the transmission period itself. We also found negative associations of UV in the transmission period and in January with rate of cumulative deaths, but at lower levels of statistical significance. We conclude that in addition to a sterilizing effect during the transmission period, UV may have a physiological effect in reducing transmission and deaths due to COVID-19, most likely through the medium of vitamin D production in the body. This follows the growing body of medical evidence that vitamin D deficiency is associated with severity of COVID-19. However, we also found a negative correlation between altitude and rates of COVID-19 transmission, distinct and independent of the UV effect, which may indicate that other physiological processes are also present. In a multiple regression, altitude and UV together accounted for 18% of the variation in transmission rates between cities.","Background Despite effective means to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection, the early treatment seeking behavior of those newly diagnosed with infection is not clear.","Accumulating evidence has shown that cellular double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) induce antiviral innate immune responses in human normal and malignant cancer cells. However, it is not fully understood how endogenous \u2018self\u2019 dsRNA homeostasis is regulated in the cell. Here, we show that an RNA-binding protein, DEAD-box RNA helicase 3X (DDX3X), prevents the aberrant accumulation of cellular dsRNAs. Loss of DDX3X induces dsRNA sensor-mediated type I interferon signaling and innate immune response in breast cancer cells due to abnormal cytoplasmic accumulation of dsRNAs. Dual depletion of DDX3X and a dsRNA-editing protein, ADAR1 synergistically activates the cytosolic dsRNA pathway in breast cancer cell. Moreover, inhibiting DDX3X enhances the antitumor activity by increasing tumor intrinsic-type I interferon response, antigen presentation, and tumor-infiltration of cytotoxic T cells as well as dendritic cells in breast tumors, which may lead to the development of breast cancer therapy by targeting DDX3X in combination with immune checkpoint blockade.","At least since March 2020, the multiorgan disease COVID-19 has a firm grip on the world. Although most of the cases are mild, patients from risk populations could develop a cytokine storm, which is characterized by a systemic inflammatory response leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome and organ failure. The present paper will introduce the small molecule MP1032, describe its mode of action, and give rationale why it is a promising option for prevention/treatment of SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine storm. MP1032 is a phase-pure anhydrous polymorph of 5-amino-2,3-dihydro-1,4-pthalazinedione sodium salt that exhibits good stability and bioavailability. The physiological action of MP1032 is based on a multi-target mechanism including localized, self-limiting antioxidant activities that were demonstrated in a model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced joint inflammation. Furthermore, immune-regulatory and PARP-1 modulating properties, coupled with antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 were shown in various cell models. Efficacy has been preclinically elucidated in LPS-induced endotoxemia, a model with excessively activated immune responses that shares many similarities to COVID-19. So far, during oral clinical development with three-months daily administrations, no serious adverse drug reactions occurred highlighting the outstanding safety profile of MP1032.","","AIM: To explore the effect of Hejie decoction (HJD) (mediation decoction) on T cellular immune state of chronic hepatitis B patients. METHODS: Sixty-five patients with chronic hepatitis B were randomly divided into 2 groups. Forty patients in the treatment group were treated by HJD, and 25 patients in the control group were treated by routine Western medicine. The TCRVb7 gene expression, T lymphocyte subsets (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD4+/CD8+) levels were observed before and after treatment. RESULTS: The level of CD4+ cells was lower whereas the level of CD8+ cells was higher in patients than in the normal group. There was no significant difference between the levels of CD3+ cells in patients and normal persons. After 6 months of treatment, ALT, AST, TB levels of the 2 groups were obviously decreased, and the level of CD4+ cells was increased whereas the level of CD8+ cells was decreased in the treatment group. However, the level of CD4+ cells and CD8+ cells had no significant difference in the control group. TCRVb7 expressions were detected in 6 patients of the treatment group, whose HBV-DNA and HBeAg turned negative and ALT became normal. HBeAg in another 3 patients turned negative while HBV-DNA did not, and TCRVb7 expressions were not detectable. TCRVb7 expression could not be detected in the control group, HBV-DNA of the control group did not turn negative. HBeAg in 1 patient turned negative while HBV-DNA did not, and TCRVb7 expressions were not detectable. The total effective rate was not significantly different between the 2 groups and the markedly effective rate was significantly different (P &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSION: HJD is effective for treating chronic hepatitis B, and its effect seems to relate with the improvement of the TCRVb7 expression of chronic hepatitis B patients, thus activating T cells and eliminating HBV. T cellular immune function plays an important role in HBV infection and virus elimination. ","The COVID-19 virus has infected millions of people and resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. By using the logistic regression model, we identified novel critical factors associated with COVID19 cases, death, and case fatality rates in 154 countries and in the 50 U.S. states. Among numerous factors associated with COVID-19 risk, we found that the unitary state system was counter-intuitively positively associated with increased COVID-19 cases and deaths. Blood type B was a protective factor for COVID-19 risk, while blood type A was a risk factor. The prevalence of HIV, influenza and pneumonia, and chronic lower respiratory diseases was associated with reduced COVID-19 risk. Obesity and the condition of unimproved water sources were associated with increased COVID-19 risk. Other factors included temperature, humidity, social distancing, smoking, and vitamin D intake. Our comprehensive identification of the factors affecting COVID-19 transmission and fatality may provide new insights into the COVID-19 pandemic and advise effective strategies for preventing and migrating COVID-19 spread.","Background Among middle-aged and elderly individuals, dietary habits have previously been reported to differ between patients with and without periodontal disease. However, in young adults, there are only a few reports that show a correlation between nutrient/food intake and periodontal disease. Moreover, no report has assessed the correlation between dietary habits measured by a self-administered diet history questionnaire (DHQ) and periodontal disease. Therefore, we assessed the correlation between dietary habits, determined using a DHQ, and periodontal disease in young adult women who are likely to develop a periodontal disease.","Objective Diabetes is a known risk factor for mortality in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Our objective was to identify prevalence of hyperglycemia in COVID-19 patients with and without prior diabetes and quantify its association with COVID-19 disease course.","Purpose Exploring the effect of COVID-19 diagnosis on the individual has not been explored through an exploratory qualitative approach. This study aims to explore the physical, social, and psychological impact of the diagnosis on the individual through online interviews.","Background Suicide attempts (SA) frequently occur in patients with mood disorders and schizophrenia, which are both accompanied by activated immune-inflammatory and nitro-oxidative (IO&amp;NS) pathways.","Background After decades of rising life expectancy, life expectancy in the developed West is currently stagnated and remains shorter in men than women. Very well-established evolutionary biology theory suggests that lifespan trades off against reproductive success, possibly sex-specifically. We examined whether a key driver of reproductive success, testosterone, affected lifespan using a Mendelian randomization study of longevity in the UK Biobank to obtain unbiased estimates, along with control exposures.","Background Water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services have the potential to interrupt transmission of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria and reduce the need for antibiotics, thereby reducing selection for resistance. However, evidence of WASH impacts on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is lacking.","","Background Anemia occurs because of insufficient hemoglobin, which provides oxygen to the body. Because of its close relationship with various illnesses, it must always be investigated clinically. Previous studies have demonstrated an association between hemoglobin concentration and handgrip strength. Thus, we aimed to analyze the association between handgrip strength and anemia in Korean adults to determine whether the handgrip strength test can be used as a tool to identify anemia.","mtDNA-based phylogenetic trees of the order Primates were constructed by the minimum evolution (ME) and maximum likelihood (ML) methods. Branch lengths were compared with the mean female age at first birth in the taxa studied. Higher reproductive age in females triggers a lower number of generations through time and, on average, at the molecular level smaller evolutionary distances between related taxa. However, this relationship is significant when the phylogeny is resolved by the ME method rather than the ML method. Reliability of the minimum evolution approach is discussed. In contrast to most studies, the ME tree recovers Tarsius bancanus (Tarsiiformes) as a member of the Strepsirrhini, which phylogeny is supported by a strong branch length\u2013reproductive age relationship and which is proposed as a novel heuristic method to test phylogeny. However, branches of certain taxa on the constructed phylogenetic tree show anomalous lengths relative to the mean female age at first birth, such as e.g. the human branch. As estimated in this paper, early members of the human lineage have likely reproduced at higher rates than modern humans, some forms possibly giving first birth at the mean age of 10\u201312 years, which is more comparable to the mean age at first birth in extant gorillas than to that typical of living humans and chimpanzees. Probable early reproduction in human ancestors is also supported by the comparably more evolved mitochondrial DNA in Denisovans than in modern humans, and by a smaller body mass in most fossil hominins, which often triggers fast maturation in primates.","Inter-chemical correlations in metabolomics and exposomics datasets provide valuable information for studying relationships among reported chemicals measured in human specimens. With an increase in the size of these datasets, a network graph analysis and visualization of the correlation structure is difficult to interpret. While co-regulatory genes databases have been developed, a similar database for metabolites and chemicals have not been developed yet. We have developed the Integrated Data Science Laboratory for Metabolomics and Exposomics - Chemical Correlation Database (IDSL.CCDB), as a systematic catalogue of inter-chemical correlation in publicly available metabolomics and exposomics studies. The database has been provided via an online interface to create single compound-centric views that are clear, readable and meaningful. We have demonstrated various applications of the database to explore: 1) the chemicals from a chemical class such as Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), phthalates and tobacco smoke related metabolites; 2) xenobiotic metabolites such as caffeine and acetaminophen; 3) endogenous metabolites (acyl-carnitines); and 4) unannotated peaks for PFAS. The database has a rich collection of 36 human studies, including the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and high-quality untargeted metabolomics datasets. IDSL.CCDB is supported by a simple, interactive and user-friendly web-interface to retrieve and visualize the inter-chemical correlation data. The IDSL.CCDB has the potential to be a key computational resource in metabolomics and exposomics facilitating the expansion of our understanding about biological and chemical relationships among metabolites and chemical exposures in the human body. The database is available at www.ccdb.idsl.me site.","Background The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 seemed to affect locations in the northern hemisphere most severely appearing to overlap with the pattern of seasonal vitamin D deficiency. Integrating available knowledge, we hypothesised that vitamin D status could play a causal role in COVID-19 outcomes.","Objective In this study, we evaluated the efficiency of the combination of two variants\u2019 AFO-202 and N-163 strains of Aureobasidium Pullulans produced in comparison with the control arm, which underwent a conventional regimen of treatment alone, for a shorter duration of 15 days.","Background The second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to considerable morbidity and mortality in India, in part due to lack of healthcare access, low health literacy, and poor disease surveillance. In this retrospective, descriptive ecological study, we utilized Google Trends (GT) to characterize the second COVID-19 wave and its association with official case counts based on search terms related to symptoms, testing, disease complications, medications, preventive behaviors, and healthcare utilization.","Background Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has developed into a full-blown global pandemic. It has been reported that patients with COVID-19 meeting the criteria for hospital discharge (including two consecutive negative RT-PCR results) have experienced recurrent PCR positivity. However, the clinical course and risk factors for these patients have not been well described.","Background Vitamin C, also called ascorbic acid, is a water-soluble antioxidant and free radical scavenger. It is required in the body for numerous metabolic functions and is involved in the development of proteins and connective tissue. Methods In April 2020, a systematic search was carried out on five electronic databases (Medline, Embase, Cochrane, Cinahl, PsycINFO) to find studies on the use, efficacy and safety of a complementary therapy with vitamin C in oncological patients. Results Out of the initial 23,195 search results, 21 studies with 1961 patients were included in this review. Five of the included studies (n = 417) were randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The remaining 16 studies belonged to a lower class of evidence. The patients who were treated with vitamin C suffered from various malignant diseases, some in an advanced and palliative stage. Vitamin C was applied intravenously or orally. It was either the only treatment or was combined with chemo- or radiotherapy. Endpoints included the development of the disease-related symptoms, quality of life, mortality, progression-free survival and safety of vitamin C. The studies were of moderate quality and showed either no effect of vitamin C or a positive trend, although this has rarely been statistically proven in group comparisons. No or only slight side effects with both oral and intravenous administration of vitamin C were reported. Conclusion Oral intake of vitamin C does not appear to have any effect in patients with malignancies. Data are heterogeneous for intravenous administration. There are no RCTs with statistical group comparisons. ","Background Ivermectin is one among several potential drugs explored for its therapeutic and preventive role in COVID-19 infection. The study was aimed to explore the association between ivermectin prophylaxis and development of COVID-19 infection among healthcare workers.","Background COVID-19 is a rapidly spreading disease that has caused extensive burden to individuals, families, countries, and the world. Effective treatments of COVID-19 are urgently needed. This is the second edition of a living systematic review of randomized clinical trials assessing the effects of all treatment interventions for participants in all age groups with COVID-19.","The COVID-19 pandemic originated in Wuhan, China on December 31st and spread into international borders, leading to a public health crisis and complete shutdown of countries. The strict quarantine measures taken by governments kept a large number of people, around the world, in isolation and affected many aspects of people\u2019s lives. These unprecedented changes triggered a wide variety of psychological problems ranging from panic disorders, anxiety and depression. In this study, we aim to explore anxiety levels among parents, teachers and the general community amid the COVID-19 pandemic in the UAE, as well as identify emotional and anxiety disorders in children. Using a web-based cross-sectional survey we collected data from 2,200 self-selected assessed volunteers. Demographic information, knowledge and beliefs about COVID-19, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) using the (GAD-7) scale, emotional problems in children using the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ), worry and fear about COVID-19, coping mechanisms and general health information were collected. The overall prevalence of GAD in the general population was 71% with younger people (59.8%) and females (51.7%) reporting the highest levels of anxiety. Parents who were teachers reported the highest percentage of emotional problems in children (26.7%) compared to parents only (14.6%) or teachers only (4.7%). Multivariate logistic regression for GAD-7 score showed that females, participants who felt public fear was justifiable, persons who worried about COVID-19, persons who intended to take the COVID-19 vaccine and smokers were all associated with anxiety. Multivariate logistic regression for SDQ showed parents who had severe anxiety levels were 7 times more likely to report more emotional problems in their children (OR=7.00, 95% CI, 3.45 to 14.0) than less anxious parents. Findings suggest the urgency of policy makers to develop effective screening and coping strategies for parents and teachers and more specifically for vulnerable children.","The nutrient-rich tubers of the greater yam Dioscorea alata L. provide food and income security for millions of people around the world. Despite its global importance, however, greater yam remains an \u201corphan crop.\u201d Here we address this resource gap by presenting a highly-contiguous chromosome-scale genome assembly of greater yam combined with a dense genetic map derived from African breeding populations. The genome sequence reveals an ancient lineage-specific genome duplication, followed by extensive genome-wide reorganization. Using our new genomic tools we find quantitative trait loci for susceptibility to anthracnose, a damaging fungal pathogen of yam, and several tuber quality traits. Genomic analysis of breeding lines reveals both extensive inbreeding as well as regions of extensive heterozygosity that may represent interspecific introgression during domestication. These tools and insights will enable yam breeders to unlock the potential of this staple crop and take full advantage of its adaptability to varied environments.","We combined clinical, cytokine, genomic, methylation and dietary data from 43 young adult monozygotic twin pairs (aged 22 \u2013 36, 53% female), where 25 of the twin pairs were substantially weight discordant (delta BMI &gt; 3kg/ m2). These measurements were originally taken as part of the TwinFat study, a substudy of The Finnish Twin Cohort study. These five large multivariate data sets (comprising 42, 71, 1587, 1605 and 63 variables, respectively) were jointly analysed using an integrative machine learning method called Group Factor Analysis (GFA) to offer new hypotheses into the multi-molecular-level interactions associated with the development of obesity. New potential links between cytokines and weight gain are identified, as well as associations between dietary, inflammatory and epigenetic factors. This encouraging case study aims to enthuse the research community to boldly attempt new machine learning approaches which have the potential to yield novel and unintuitive hypotheses. The source code of the GFA method is publically available as the R package GFA.","Currently, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has a worldwide epidemic, causing more than 80 million infections and more than 1.7 million deaths. The pandemic has led to the closure of enterprises and schools in many countries, resulting in serious disruption of the global economy and social activities. Remdesivir is currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of COVID-19, but the WHO declared that Remdesivir is almost ineffective against COVID-19. The research and development of vaccines has made great progress, but it will take at least several months for safe and effective vaccines to be widely used clinically. Clinical studies revealed that some Traditional Chinese Medicines, such as Lianhua Qingwen Capsule and Huoxiang Zhengqi Water, exhibited excellent therapeutic effect on COVID-19. However, until now, there is still no cure for COVID-19. Therefore, there is an urgent need to find medicines that can effectively fight against the SARS-CoV-2. In this study, JIE BEN No. 10 (JB10), a fermentation broth produced by Yi traditional medicine fermentation technology, was explored for its anti-coronavirus activity. The in vitro data showed that JB10 could significantly suppresses the replication of the SARS-CoV-2 with an EC50 of 769.1 times dilution and a selection index of 42.68. Further studies indicated that JB10 had significant anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. The analysis of active components suggested that JB10 contained a large amount of superoxide dismutase (SOD), flavones, polyphenols, crude polysaccharide, etc. which may explain the anti-coronavirus activity, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Our study provides a new potentially therapeutic strategy for COVID-19.","Current animal-free methods to assess teratogenicity of drugs under development still deliver high numbers of false negatives, and more sensitive approaches of toxicity prediction are required. To address this issue, we characterized the TeraTox test, a newly developed multi-lineage differentiation assay for human teratogenicity prediction using 3D human induced pluripotent stem cells. TeraTox produces as primary output concentration-dependent data sets for each test compound on cytotoxicity and altered gene expression. These data are then fed into a prediction model based on an interpretable machine-learning approach. The final information obtained relates to the concentration-dependent human teratogenicity potential of drug candidates. We applied TeraTox to profile 33 approved pharmaceuticals and 12 proprietary drug candidates with known in vivo data. This way, it was possible to relate the test predictions to known human or animal toxicity. The TeraTox had an accuracy of 69% (specificity: 53%, sensitivity: 79%). It clearly performed better than two quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models and it had a higher sensitivity than the murine embryonic stem cell test (mEST) run in the same laboratory. By combining TeraTox and mEST data, the overall prediction accuracy was further improved. The knowledge on the pattern of altered gene expression may provide additional value in grouping toxicologically similar compounds and possibly deducing common modes of action. The assay will thus be a helpful additional tool in drug discovery, and the dataset provided here will be a valuable resource for the field of stem cell-based drug profiling.","Background Intake, either as dietary components or as supplements, and blood concentrations of vitamin E, C, lycopene and carotenoids have been associated with a lower risk of incident (ischemic) stroke. However, causality cannot not be inferred from these associations. Here, we investigated causality by analyzing the associations between genetically-influenced antioxidant levels in blood and ischemic stroke using Mendelian Randomization (MR).","Background Low and deficient levels of vitamin A are common in low and middle income countries where tuberculosis burden is high. We assessed the impact of baseline levels of vitamins A and carotenoids on TB disease risk.","Background It is to be determined whether people infected with SARS-CoV-2 will develop long-term immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and retain long-lasting protective antibodies after the infection is resolved. This study was to explore to explore the outcomes of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in four groups of individuals in Wuhan, China.","Background Neural tube defects (NTDs) remain among the most common congenital anomalies. Contributing risk factors include genetics and nutrient deficiencies, however, a comprehensive assessment of nutrient-gene interactions in NTDs is lacking. We hypothesised that multiple nutrient-gene interactions would be evident in NTD-associated gene signatures.","Major life changing events such as the COVID-19 pandemic may have major impact on one's health and general well-being. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and predictive factors, including gender specific differences, of Complementary Medicine (CM) use (including CM consultations, self-care management and self-help techniques) during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 in the Netherlands. CM use was studied among a random representative sample (n = 1004) of the adult Dutch population using an online survey conducted from 22-27 May 2020. The survey included a modified version of I-CAM-Q and additional questions on demographic characteristics, reasons for CM use, perceived effectiveness and side effects. 68.0% of the participants reported to have used CM (CM consultations (13.3%), self-management strategies (59.4%), self-help techniques (30.0%)). Most frequently reported reason of CM use was to improve general well-being (61.6%), prevention and/or treatment of COVID-19 was only reported by 10%. Perceived effectiveness of CM was high and number of experienced side effects low. Being a women, worried to get infected with COVID-19, higher education and living in northern/ middle region of the Netherlands were predictive factors to use CM. In the Netherlands, specific groups (e.g. women/ highly educated) use CM, mainly to improve general wellbeing, and seem to benefit of it during the first months of the pandemic. The high perceived effectiveness and low reporting of side effects should encourage medical professionals and policy makers for more openness towards considering CM as being part of an integrative approach to public health in times life changing events occur.","Predictability is a fundamental requirement in biological engineering. As we move to building coordinated multicellular systems, the potential for such systems to display chaotic behaviour becomes a concern. Therefore understanding which systems show chaos is an important design consideration. We developed a methodology to explore the potential for chaotic dynamics in small microbial communities governed by resource competition, intercellular communication and competitive bacteriocin interactions. We show that we can expect to find chaotic states in relatively small synthetic microbial systems, understand the governing dynamics and provide insights into how to control such systems. This work is the first to query the existence of chaotic behaviour in synthetic microbial communities and has important ramifications for the fields of biotechnology, bioprocessing and synthetic biology.","Shigella spp. are the causative agents of bacillary dysentery or shigellosis, mainly in children living in developing countries. The study of Shigella entire life cycle in vivo and the evaluation of vaccine candidates\u2019 protection efficacy have been hampered by the lack of a suitable animal model of infection (1). None of the ones evaluated so far (mouse, rabbit, guinea pig) allows to recapitulate shigellosis symptoms upon Shigella oral challenge. Historical reports suggest that dysentery and scurvy are both metabolic diseases associated with ascorbate-deficiency. Mammals which are susceptible to Shigella infection (humans, non-human primates and guinea pigs) are the lonely ones which are unable to synthesize ascorbate. We optimized a low-ascorbate diet to induce moderate ascorbate-deficiency but not scurvy in guinea pigs (Ascplasma conc.=1.6 \u03bcM vs 36 \u03bcM with optimal ascorbate supply). We demonstrated that moderate ascorbate-deficiency increases shigellosis severity during extended period of time (up to 48h) with all strains tested (Shigella flexneri 5a and 2a, Shigella sonnei). At late time-points, a massive influx of neutrophils was observed both within the disrupted colonic mucosa and in the luminal compartment, although Shigella remains able to disseminate deep into the organ to reach the sub-mucosal layer and the bloodstream. This new model of shigellosis opens new doors for the study both of Shigella infection strategy and innate and adaptive immune responses to Shigella infection. It may be also of a great interest to study the virulence of other pathogen for which no suitable animal model of infection is available (Vibrio cholerae, Yersinia pestis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis or Campylobacter jejuni, among others).","The offering of grocery stores is a strong driver of consumer decisions, shaping their diet and long-term health. While processed food has been increasingly associated with unhealthy diet, information on the degree of processing characterising an item in a store is virtually impossible to obtain, limiting the ability of individuals to make informed choices. Here we introduce GroceryDB, a database with over 50,000 food items sold by Walmart, Target, and Wholefoods, unveiling the degree of processing characterizing each food. GroceryDB indicates that 73% of the US food supply is ultra-processed, and on average ultra-processed foods are 52% cheaper than minimally-processed alternatives. We find that the nutritional choices of the consumers, translated as the degree of food processing, strongly depend on the food categories and grocery stores. We show that there is no single nutrient or ingredient \u201cbio-marker\u201d for ultra-processed food, allowing us to quantify the individual contribution of over 1,000 ingredients to ultra-processing. GroceryDB and the associated http://TrueFood.Tech/ website make this information available, aiming to simultaneously empower the consumers to make healthy food choices, and aid policy makers to reform the food supply.","Due to our interest in the chemical space of organic dyes to identify potential small-molecule inhibitors (SMIs) for protein-protein interactions (PPIs), we initiated a screen of such compounds to assess their inhibitory activity against the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its cognate receptor ACE2, which is the first critical step initiating the viral attachment and entry of this coronavirus responsible for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As part of this, we found that methylene blue, a tricyclic phenothiazine compound approved by the FDA for the treatment of methemoglobinemia and used for other medical applications (including the inactivation of viruses in blood products prior to transfusion when activated by light), inhibits this interaction. We confirmed that it does so in a concentration-dependent manner with a low micromolar half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50 = 3 \u03bcM) in our protein-based ELISA-type setup, while chloroquine, siramesine, and suramin showed no inhibitory activity in this assay. Erythrosine B, which we have shown before to be a promiscuous SMI of PPIs, also inhibited this interaction with an activity similar, possibly slightly higher, than those found for it for other PPIs. This PPI inhibitory activity of methylene blue could contribute to its antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 even in the absence of light by blocking its attachment to ACE2-expressing cells and making this inexpensive and widely available drug potentially useful in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 as an oral or inhaled medication.","Caffeine is by far the most ubiquitous psychostimulant worldwide found in tea, coffee, cocoa, energy drinks, and many other beverages and food. Caffeine is almost exclusively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P-450 enzyme system to the main product paraxanthine and the additional products theobromine and theophylline. Besides its stimulating properties, two important applications of caffeine are metabolic phenotyping of cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) and liver function testing. An open challenge in this context is to identify underlying causes of the large inter-individual variability in caffeine pharmacokinetics. Data is urgently needed to understand and quantify confounding factors such as lifestyle (e.g. smoking), the effects of drug-caffeine interactions (e.g. medication metabolized via CYP1A2), and the effect of disease. Here we report the first integrative and systematic analysis of data on caffeine pharmacokinetics from 148 publications and provide a comprehensive high-quality data set on the pharmacokinetics of caffeine, caffeine metabolites, and their metabolic ratios in human adults. The data set is enriched by meta-data on the characteristics of studied patient cohorts and subjects (e.g. age, body weight, smoking status, health status), the applied interventions (e.g. dosing, substance, route of application), measured pharmacokinetic time-courses, and pharmacokinetic parameters (e.g. clearance, half-life, area under the curve). We demonstrate via multiple applications how the data set can be used to solidify existing knowledge and gain new insights relevant for metabolic phenotyping and liver function testing based on caffeine. Specifically, we analyzed (i) the alteration of caffeine pharmacokinetics with smoking and use of oral contraceptives; (ii) drug-drug interactions with caffeine as possible confounding factors of caffeine pharmacokinetics or source of adverse effects; (iii) alteration of caffeine pharmacokinetics in disease; and (iv) the applicability of caffeine as a salivary test substance by comparison of plasma and saliva data. In conclusion, our data set and analyses provide important resources which could enable more accurate caffeine-based metabolic phenotyping and liver function testing.","Tropical fish are fast-growing and high energetic-demand organisms, which can be highly vulnerable to long-lasting effects of heat stress and pollution, particularly under food shortages. We tested this by assessing highly complex direct and delayed interactive effects of an extreme temperature (32\u00b0C) from a simulated marine heatwave (MHW), copper (Cu, 0, 100, 150 and 175 \u00b5g L-1) and food availability (limited and saturated food) on larvae of a tropical, reef-associated seaperch (Psammoperca waigiensis). Cu, MHW, and food limitation independently reduced survival and growth, partly explained by reduced feeding. The negative effect of Cu on fish survival was more substantial under MHW, particularly under limited food. Delayed interactive effects of Cu, MHW, and food limitation were still lethal to fish larvae during the post-exposure period. These results indicate that reef-associated fish larvae are highly vulnerable to these dominant stressors, impairing their ecological function as predators in the coral reefs.","Introduction Emerging infectious diseases, especially the coronavirus disease identified in 2019 (COVID-19), can be complicated by a severe exacerbation in the Th17 cell-mediated IL-17 proinflammatory immune storm. This enhanced immune response plays a major role in mortality and morbidity, including neurological symptoms. We hypothesized that countering the cytokine storm with thiamine may have therapeutic efficacy in lowering the Th17 cell proinflammatory response. We used an in vitro study and corroborated those results in disease controls (DC). We developed an effective dose range and model for key pharmacokinetic measures with the potential of targeting the cytokine storm and neurological symptoms of COVID-19.","Background The associations between vegetable intake and metabolic risk factors remain inconsistent. This study was aimed to investigate the association between cooked and raw vegetable intake with serum lipids, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure and glycemic traits.","Objectives We examined the influence of the ex vivo combination therapy of metformin (Met, 1,1-dimethylbiguanide hydrochloride) with sodium selenite (Ss, Na2SeO3) on the changes in the production of nitric oxide (NO) and selected cytokines by circulating monocytes (MOs) during T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL).","Cytoplasmic lipid droplets are highly dynamic storage organelles; their rapid synthesis, expansion, and degradation, as well as their varied interactions with other organelles allow cells to maintain lipid homeostasis. While the molecular details of lipid droplet dynamics are currently a very active area of investigation, this work has been primarily performed in cultured cells and in vitro systems. By taking advantage of the powerful transgenic and in vivo imaging opportunities afforded by the zebrafish model system, we have built a suite of tools to allow lipid droplets to be studied in real-time from the subcellular to the whole organism level. Fluorescently-tagging the lipid droplet associated proteins, perilipin 2 and perilipin 3, in the endogenous loci, permits visualization of lipid droplets in the intestine, liver, lateral line and adipose tissue. Using these transgenic lines we have found that perilipin 3 is rapidly loaded on intestinal lipid droplets following a high fat meal and then largely replaced by perilipin 2 a few hours later. These powerful new tools will facilitate studies on the role of lipid droplets in different tissues and under different genetic and physiological manipulations.","Background Nepal is currently under lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic with misinformation circulating on social media. This study aimed to analyse the knowledge and awareness of COVID-19 amongst eye care professionals in Nepal.","Objectives This study explores the clinical profiles and factors associated with COVID-19 in Cameroon.","Echinacea purpurea was shown to broadly inhibit coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. This review discusses the available clinical evidence from randomized, blinded and controlled human studies. Two RCTs with results on enveloped viruses, respectively coronavirus infections during prevention treatment were detected. Incidence and/or viral loads were measured by RT-PCR and symptom severity was recorded. Jawad et al. (2012) collected nasopharyngeal swabs from adults (N=755) over 4 months of continuous prevention. Overall, 24 and 47 enveloped virus infections occurred, including 21 and 33 coronavirus detections [229E; HKU1; OC43] with Echinaforce\u00ae extract [2\u2019400mg daily] and placebo, respectively (p=0.0114). Ogal et al. (2021) administered the same extract [1\u2019200mg] or control for 4 months to children (4 \u2013 12 years) (N=203). Echinacea reduced the incidence of enveloped virus infections from 47 to 29 (p=0.0038) whereas 11 and 13 coronavirus detections [229E, OC43, NL63] were counted (p&gt;0.05). Respiratory symptoms during coronavirus infections were significantly lower with area-under-curve AUC=75.8 (+/-50.24) versus 27.1 (+/-21.27) score points (p=0.0036). Importantly, viral loads in nasal secretions were significantly reduced by 98.5%, with Ct-values 31.1 [95% CI 26.3; 35.9] versus 25.0 [95% CI 20.5; 29.5] (p = 0.0479). Results from clinical studies confirm the antiviral activity found for Echinacea in vitro, embracing enveloped respiratory pathogens and therefore coronaviruses as well. Substantiating results from a new completed study seems to extrapolate these effects to the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. As hypothesized, the testified broad antiviral activity of Echinacea extract appears to be inclusive for SARS-CoV-2.","Motivation Many calculations in computational biology necessitate a use of a probabilistic optimisation protocol to determine a set of parameters that capture the system at a desired state in the configurational space. Here, we developed a flexible optimisation engine in R that can be plugged to any, simple or complex, modelling initiative through a few lucid interfacing functions, to perform a seamless optimisation with rigorous parameter sampling.","Objectives extracellular vesicles (EVs) represent key biological mediators of several physiological functions within the cell microenvironment. Platelets are the most abundant source of EVs in the blood, contributing to the plastic and versatile behaviour of these cells. Similarly, platelet lysate (PL), the best angiogenic performer of platelet origin and routinely employed for regenerative purposes, is enriched of EVs, but their role is still too poorly discovered to be suitably exploited. Here we explored the contribution of the EVs contained in PL, by investigating the biological and molecular features related to the angiogenic capacity extrapolated from that possessed by PL.","Identifying what therapies constitute complementary, alternative, and/or integrative medicine (CAIM) is complex for a multitude of reasons. An operational definition is dynamic, and changes based on both historical time period and geographical location whereby many jurisdictions may integrate or consider their traditional system(s) of medicine as conventional care. To date, only one operational definition of \"complementary and alternative medicine\" has been proposed, by Cochrane researchers in 2011. This definition is not only over a decade old but also did not use systematic methods to compile the therapies. Furthermore, it did not capture the concept \"integrative medicine\", which is an increasingly popular aspect of the use of complementary therapies in practice. An updated operational definition reflective of CAIM is warranted given the rapidly increasing body of CAIM research literature published each year. Four peer-reviewed or otherwise quality-assessed information resource types were used to inform the development of the operational definition: peer-reviewed articles resulting from searches across seven academic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Scopus and Web of Science); the \"aims and scope\" webpages of peer-reviewed CAIM journals; CAIM entries found in online encyclopedias, and highly-ranked websites identified through searches of CAIM-related terms on HONcode. Screening of eligible resources, and data extraction of CAIM therapies across them, were each conducted independently and in duplicate. CAIM therapies across eligible sources were deduplicated. A total of 101 eligible resources were identified: peer-reviewed articles (n = 19), journal \"aims and scope\" webpages (n = 22), encyclopedia entries (n = 11), and HONcode-searched websites (n = 49). Six hundred four unique CAIM terms were included in this operational definition. This updated operational definition is the first to be informed by systematic methods, and could support the harmonization of CAIM-related research through the provision of a standard of classification, as well as support improved collaboration between different research groups.","Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders in children, and ADHD patients always display circadian abnormalities. While, the ADHD drugs currently used in clinic have strong side effects, such as psychosis, allergic reactions and heart problems. Here, we demonstrated carbon dots derived from the ascorbic acid (VCDs) could strongly rescue the hyperactive and impulsive behaviour of a zebrafish ADHD disease model caused by per1b mutation. VCDs prolonged the circadian period of zebrafish for more than half an hour. In addition, the amplitude and circadian phase were also changed. The dopamine level was specifically increased, which may be caused by stimulation of the dopaminergic neuron development in the midbrain. Notably, it was found that the serotonin level was not altered by VCDs treatments. Also, the gene transcriptome effects of VCDs were discussed in present work. Our results provided the dynamic interactions of carbon dots with circadian system and dopamine signaling pathway, which illustrates a potential application of degradable and bio-safe VCDs for the treatment of the attention deficient and hyperactive disorder through circadian intervention.","Ferroptosis, a term first proposed in 2012, is iron-dependent, non-apoptotic regulatory cell death induced by erastin. Ferroptosis was originally discovered during synthetic lethal screening for drugs sensitive to RAS mutant cells, and is closely related to synthetic lethality. Ferroptosis sensitizes cancer stem cells and tumors that undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition and are resistant to anticancer drugs or targeted therapy. Therefore, ferroptosis-inducing molecules are attractive new research targets. In contrast, synthetic lethal strategies approach mechanisms and genetic abnormalities that cannot be directly targeted by conventional therapeutic strategies, such as RAS mutations, hypoxia, and abnormalities in the metabolic environment. They also target the environment and conditions specific to malignant cells, have a low toxicity to normal cells, and can be used in combination with known drugs to produce new ones. However, the concept of synthetic lethality has not been widely adopted with ferroptosis. In this review, we surveyed the literature on ferroptosis-related factors and synthetic lethality to examine the potential therapeutic targets in ferroptosis-related molecules, focusing on factors related to synthetic lethality, discovery methods, clinical application stages, and issues in drug discovery. ","Background: Recent interest and advances in the field of alternative medicine has promoted the use of various herbal and natural products for multiple uses in the field of medicine. Aloe vera is one such product exhibiting multiple benefits and has gained considerable importance in clinical research. This clinical study focuses on Aloe vera and highlights its property when used as a medicament in the periodontal pocket. Materials and Methods: A total number of 15 subjects were evaluated for clinical parameters like plaque index, gingival index, probing pocket depth at baseline, followed by scaling and root planing (SRP). Test site comprised of SRP followed by intra-pocket placement of Aloe vera gel, which was compared with the control site in which only SRP was done, and clinical parameters were compared between the two sites at one month and three months from baseline. Results: Results exhibited encouraging findings in clinical parameters of the role of Aloe vera gel as a drug for local delivery. Conclusion: We conclude that subgingival administration of Aloe vera gel results in improvement of periodontal condition. Aloe vera gel can be used as a local drug delivery system in periodontal pockets. ","The earliest predictors of future autoimmune diseases are a series of autoantibodies that are rarely evaluated and very within and between diseases. In addition, autoantibodies often appear just prior to disease onset. All of these factors make it difficult to apply interventions that might prevent disease. Earlier predictors of disease are needed. Here, a general population cohort was used to assess whether gut bacterial biomarkers could be identified prior to disease. Gut microbiome analysis on 1741 one-year old Swedish children was performed on samples collected in the late 1990s. These children were then followed for 18 years for the incidence of five autoimmune diseases and autism. Specific bacterial strains in the gut microbiome of one-year-old children have been identified as exclusive to the 96 subjects (cases) who acquired type 1 diabetes, celiac disease, hypothyroidism, Crohn\u2019s disease, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, or autism over their next 18 years. None of these strains were found in the 1645 children (controls) who did not acquire any of these diseases. Ten other strains were exclusive to those who remained disease-free. In most cases, the presence or absence of these bacteria were strongly associated with: 1) high-risk class II human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles; 2) dietary factors; or 3) a combination of HLA genetics and diet. These results have three significant implications: 1) certain class II HLA haplotypes may serve as bacterial gatekeepers early in life, altering microbiome composition thereby creating the potential for dysbiosis and inflammation; 2) the gut microbiome dysbiosis and inflammation during infancy, largely derived from host HLA genetics and diet, may be a common precedent to all five autoimmune diseases and autism; and 3) HLA gatekeeping may prevent gut colonization of beneficial bacteria in those genetically at-risk individuals who could most benefit from probiotic therapy.","This is an anecdotal observation of an intervention study involving laying hens from a commercial farm in the city of Chincha, Peru, who suffered an outbreak caused by Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV), confirmed by clinical observations, serological and molecular tests (PCR).","  Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused global disruption and a\nsignificant loss of life. Existing treatments that can be repurposed as\nprophylactic and therapeutic agents could reduce the pandemic's devastation.\nEmerging evidence of potential applications in other therapeutic contexts has\nled to the investigation of dietary supplements and nutraceuticals for\nCOVID-19. Such products include vitamin C, vitamin D, omega 3 polyunsaturated\nfatty acids, probiotics, and zinc, all of which are currently under clinical\ninvestigation. In this review, we critically appraise the evidence surrounding\ndietary supplements and nutraceuticals for the prophylaxis and treatment of\nCOVID-19. Overall, further study is required before evidence-based\nrecommendations can be formulated, but nutritional status plays a significant\nrole in patient outcomes, and these products could help alleviate deficiencies.\nFor example, evidence indicates that vitamin D deficiency may be associated\nwith greater incidence of infection and severity of COVID-19, suggesting that\nvitamin D supplementation may hold prophylactic or therapeutic value. A growing\nnumber of scientific organizations are now considering recommending vitamin D\nsupplementation to those at high risk of COVID-19. Because research in vitamin\nD and other nutraceuticals and supplements is preliminary, here we evaluate the\nextent to which these nutraceutical and dietary supplements hold potential in\nthe COVID-19 crisis.\n","Purpose The Oxford WebQ is a web-based 24-hour dietary assessment method which has been used in UK Biobank and other large prospective studies. The food composition table used to calculate nutrient intakes has recently been replaced with the UK Nutrient Databank, which has food composition data closer in time to when participants completed the questionnaire, and new dietary variables were incorporated. Here we describe the updated version of the Oxford WebQ questionnaire nutrient calculation, and compare nutrient intakes with the previous version used.","Introduction Covid-19 is a triphasic disorder first typified by a viral phase that lasts from the first onset of symptoms until seven days later. This is followed by a second and third phase, initially characterized by the appearance of lung infiltrates, followed in 20% by respiratory failure. The second phase is usually heralded by an elevation of serologic inflammatory markers including CRP, ferritin, IL-6, LDH as well as D-dimers. Approximately 20% proceed to the second phase and are usually then treated with dexamethasone, provided they are oxygen-dependent since these are the only cases that benefit from dexamethasone. If we had objective criteria to predict this 20% that develop severe illness, they could preemptively be treated with steroids. In this exploratory study we investigated the early use of preemptive steroids in the setting of early disease, in high-risk non-oxygen dependent cases.","BACKGROUND As of January 1, 2021, there have been 81,947,503 confirmed cases of COVID-19, resulting in 1,808,041 deaths worldwide. Several vaccines are now available for emergency use, but it will take many months to immunize the world\u2019s population. There is a pressing need for outpatient treatment now. We reviewed the possible options","Diurnal (i.e., 24-hour) physiological rhythms depend on transcriptional programs controlled by a set of circadian clock genes/proteins. Systemic factors like humoral and neuronal signals, oscillations in body temperature, and food intake align physiological circadian rhythms with external time. Thyroid hormones (THs) are major regulators of circadian clock target processes such as energy metabolism, but little is known about how fluctuations in TH levels affect the circadian coordination of tissue physiology. In this study, a high triiodothyronine (T3) state was induced in mice by supplementing T3 in the drinking water, which affected body temperature, and oxygen consumption in a time-of-day dependent manner. 24-hour transcriptome profiling of liver tissue identified 37 robustly and time independently T3 associated transcripts as potential TH state markers in the liver. Such genes participated in xenobiotic transport, lipid and xenobiotic metabolism. We also identified 10 \u2013 15 % of the liver transcriptome as rhythmic in control and T3 groups, but only 4 % of the liver transcriptome (1,033 genes) were rhythmic across both conditions \u2013 amongst these several core clock genes. In-depth rhythm analyses showed that most changes in transcript rhythms were related to mesor (50%), followed by amplitude (10%), and phase (10%). Gene set enrichment analysis revealed TH state dependent reorganization of metabolic processes such as lipid and glucose metabolism. At high T3 levels, we observed weakening or loss of rhythmicity for transcripts associated with glucose and fatty acid metabolism, suggesting increased hepatic energy turnover. In sum, we provide evidence that tonic changes in T3 levels restructure the diurnal liver metabolic transcriptome independent of local molecular circadian clocks.","Objective The COVID-19 pandemic was accompanied by varying movement restriction measures across populations worldwide. These restrictions altered daily activities at all levels, including food access and intake, as well as psychological feelings during lockdown. The main objective of the present study was to evaluate health, and nutrition behaviors during confinement during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.","We have previously identified methylene blue, a tricyclic phenothiazine dye approved for clinical use for the treatment of methemoglobinemia and used for other medical applications, as a small-molecule inhibitor of the protein-protein interaction (PPI) between the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and ACE2, the first critical step of the attachment and entry of this coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we show that methylene blue concentration-dependently inhibits this PPI for the spike protein of the original strain as well as for those of variants of concerns such as the D614G mutant and delta (B.1.617.2) with IC50 in the low micromolar range (1-5 \u03bcM). Methylene blue also showed promiscuous activity and inhibited several other PPIs of viral proteins (e.g., HCoV-NL63 \u2013 ACE2, hepatitis C virus E \u2013 CD81) as well as others (e.g., IL-2 \u2013 IL-2R\u03b1) with similar potency. This non-specificity notwithstanding, methylene blue inhibited the entry of pseudoviruses bearing the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in hACE2-expressing host cells both for the original strain and the delta variant. It also blocked SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.5) virus replication in Vero E6 cells with an IC50 in the low micromolar range (1.7 \u03bcM) when assayed using quantitative PCR of the viral RNA. Thus, while it seems to be a promiscuous PPI inhibitor with low micromolar activity and it has a relatively narrow therapeutic index, methylene blue inhibits entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2, including several of its mutant variants, and has potential as a possible inexpensive, broad-spectrum, orally bioactive small-molecule antiviral for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.","Organoids derived from stem cells become increasingly important to study human development and to model disease. However, methods are needed to control and study spatio-temporal patterns of gene expression in organoids. To this aim, we combined optogenetics and gene perturbation technologies to activate or knock-down RNA of target genes, at single-cell resolution and in programmable spatio-temporal patterns. To illustrate the usefulness of our approach, we locally activated Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling in an organoid model for human neurodevelopment. High-resolution spatial transcriptomic and single-cell analyses showed that this local induction was sufficient to generate stereotypically patterned organoids in three dimensions and revealed new insights into SHH\u2019s contribution to gene regulation in neurodevelopment.","Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) type I may occur as complication after any type of surgery for basal joint arthritis of the thumb. We investigated prospectively in an ongoing study our results after a fully standardized treatment with a total joint prosthesis under vitamin C prophylaxis. Patients with trapeziometacarpal arthritis stage II or III according to Dell, and no benefit from conservative treatment, were selected to undergo joint replacement with a semi-constrained hydroxyapatite coated prosthesis. First web opening and visual analogue scale (VAS) scores for pain, activities of daily living (ADL) and satisfaction were taken pre and postoperatively. Vitamin C 500 mg daily was started two days prior to surgery during 50 days as prevention for CRPS. Post-operative treatment was functional. We performed 40 implantations for trapeziometacarpal arthritis in 34 patients (mean age 60.8 years; 27 females, 7 males) with a mean follow-up of 44 months. Operations were performed in day care under regional (or general) anesthesia. First web opening increased with 15.4 degrees and there was a significant improvement for pain, ADL and satisfaction as well (p = 0.000). Patient satisfaction was strongly associated with the amount of pain reduction. According to the Veldman and IASP criteria, there were no cases of CRPS. The overall complication rate for this procedure is high. Literature reports 5 cases of CRPS after 38 operations with the same implant (13%). We advise vitamin C as prophylaxis against CRPS in trapeziometacarpal joint replacement. ","","","Methionine biosynthetic pathway, essential for the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) in the host, represents an attractive target for the development of novel anti-tuberculars. Here, we have biochemically characterized homoserine acetyl transferase (HSAT viz. MetA) of Mtb, which catalyses the first committed step of methionine and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) biosynthesis. High-throughput screening of a 2300 compound library resulted in identification of thiram, an anti-fungal organosulfur compound, as the most potent MetA inhibitor. Further analysis of thiram analogs led to the identification of orally bioavailable disulfiram (DIS, an anti-alcoholism FDA approved drug) as a novel inhibitor of MetA. Both thiram and DIS restricted the growth of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant Mtb strains in a bactericidal manner. ThermoFlour assay demonstrated direct binding of DIS with MetA. Metabolomic and transcriptomic studies showed DIS mediated perturbation of methionine and redox homeostasis, respectively, in Mtb. In concordance, the effect of DIS on Mtb growth was partially rescued by supplementation with either L-methionine as well as N-acetyl cysteine, suggesting a multi-target killing mechanism. In Mtb-infected mice, DIS administration restricted bacterial growth, increased efficacy of isoniazid, ameliorated lung pathology, modulated lung immune cell landscape and protective immune response. Taken together, our results demonstrate that DIS can be repurposed for designing an effective anti-tubercular therapy.","Objectives A plethora of medicines have been repurposed or used as adjunctive therapies for COVID-19. We characterized the utilization of medicines as prescribed in routine practice amongst patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in South Korea, China, Spain, and the USA.","Background Despite the observed associations between psychiatric disorders and nutrient intake, genetic studies are limited.","The experiments for evaluation of the effect of Immunobeta were performed with turkeys and organically reared layer hens. Turkeys received Immunobeta at a dose of 4 g/kg feed during the beginning of lay (cold period), thermoneutral period and hot summer period. In hens, two dietary levels of Immunobeta were tested: 2 g/kg and 4 g/kg. Blood serum and egg lysozyme levels, alternative pathway of complement activation (APCA) and beta-lysins concentrations were determined. It was found out that Immunobeta had a beneficial effect on serum lysozyme, APCA activity and beta-lysins in turkeys and hens. The lysozyme concentration in egg white was statistically significantly higher in eggs produced by birds treated with both doses of the immunomodulator.","","Background Globally, the novel coronavirus, is a public health problem causing respiratory infections. Since the outbreak of severe acute and Middle East respiratory syndromes coronavirus was not reported to cause human infections. Now, it become an epidemic proportion with growing number of cases and deaths.","Severe COVID 19 disease is associated with high morbidity and mortality with limited therapeutic options. The role of glucocorticoids in treatment of COVID 19 has been riddled with controversy. The study site has been using glucocorticoids in patients with severe COVID 19 since the first few patients of COVID 19 that were admitted. In the initial cohort of 7 patients with severe COVID disease, use of methylprednisolone in a dose of 30 mg twice daily was associated with rapid improvement in oxygenation and decline in CRP levels. While six patients made a complete clinical recovery, one patient died. There were no secondary infections.","Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) possesses a two-component regulatory system, DosRST, that enables Mtb to sense host immune cues and establish a state of non-replicating persistence (NRP). NRP bacteria are tolerant to several anti-mycobacterial drugs and are thought to play a role in the long course of tuberculosis (TB) therapy. Therefore, small molecules that inhibit Mtb from establishing or maintaining NRP could reduce the reservoir of drug tolerant bacteria and function as an adjunct therapy to reduce treatment time. Previously, we reported the discovery of six novel chemical inhibitors of DosRST, named HC101A-106A, from a whole cell, reporter-based phenotypic high throughput screen. Here, we report functional and mechanism of action studies of HC104A and HC106A. RNAseq transcriptional profiling shows that the compounds downregulate genes of the DosRST regulon. Both compounds reduce hypoxia-induced triacylglycerol synthesis by ~50%. HC106A inhibits Mtb survival during hypoxia-induced NRP, however, HC104A did not inhibit survival during NRP. An electrophoretic mobility assay shows that HC104A inhibits DosR DNA binding in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that HC104A may function by directly targeting DosR. In contrast, UV-visible spectroscopy studies suggest HC106A directly targets the histidine kinase heme, via a mechanism that is distinct from the oxidation and alkylation of heme previously observed with artemisinin (HC101A). Synergistic interactions were observed when DosRST inhibitors were examined in pair-wise combinations with the strongest potentiation observed between artemisinin paired with HC102A, HC103A, or HC106A. Our data collectively show that the DosRST pathway can be inhibited by multiple distinct mechanisms.","Motivation Bladder cancer cells acquire persistent infection associated with oncolytic Newcastle disease virus (NDV) in which its molecular events are still unclear. This poses a potential problem for oncolytic virus application for cancer therapy. To unravel the molecular mechanism underlying the development of NDV persistent infection in bladder cancer, we used mRNA expression profile of the persistently infected bladder cancer cells to construct PPI network.","Background COVID-19 patients suffer from hypercoagulation and activated immune-inflammatory pathways. This study was performed to assay serum complement C3 and C4, and thromboxane A2 (TxA2) and prostacyclin (PGI2) in association with chest CT scan anomalies (CCTAs) and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2)","Chemical modification of cytidine in non-coding RNAs plays a key role in regulating translation and disease. However, the distribution and dynamics of many of these modifications remains unknown due to a lack of sensitive site-specific sequencing technologies. Here we report a protonation-dependent sequencing reaction for detection of 5-formylcytidine (5fC) and 5-carboxycytidine (5caC) in RNA. First, we evaluate how protonation combined with electron-withdrawing substituents alters the molecular orbital energies and reduction of modified cytidine nucleosides, highlighting 5fC and 5caC as reactive species. Next, we apply this reaction to detect these modifications in synthetic oligonucleotides as well as endogenous human tRNA. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our method to characterize a patient-derived model of 5fC-deficiency, where it enables facile monitoring of both pathogenic loss and exogenous rescue of NSUN3-dependent 5fC within the wobble base of human mitochondrial tRNAMet. These studies showcase the ability of protonation to enhance the reactivity and sensitive detection of 5fC in RNA, and provide a molecular foundation for applying optimized sequencing reactions to better understand the role of oxidized RNA cytidine nucleobases in disease.","Food biodiversity presents one of the most significant opportunities to enhance food and nutrition security today. The lack of data on many plants, however, limits our understanding of their potential and the possibility of building a research agenda focused on them. Our objective with this systematic review was to identify biodiverse food plants occurring in the Caatinga biome, Brazil, strategic for the promotion of food and nutrition security. We selected studies from the following databases: Web of Science, Medline/PubMed (via the National Library of Medicine), Scopus and Embrapa Agricultural Research Databases (BDPA). Eligible were original articles, published since 2008, studying food plants occurring in the Caatinga. We assessed the methodological quality of the studies we selected. We reviewed a total of fifteen studies in which 65 plants that met our inclusion criteria were mentioned. Of this amount, 17 species, including varieties, subspecies, and different parts of plants, had data on chemical composition, in addition to being mentioned as food consumed by rural communities in observational ethnobotanical studies. From the energy and protein data associated with these plants, we produced a ranking of strategic species. The plants with values higher than the average of the set were: Dioclea grandiflora Mart. ex Benth (mucun\u00e3), Hymenaea courbaril L. (jatob\u00e1), Syagrus cearensis Noblick (coco-catol\u00e9), Libidibia ferrea (Mart. ex Tul.) L.P.Queiroz (juc\u00e1), Sideroxylon obtusifolium (Roem. &amp; Schult.) T.D.Penn. (quixabeira). We suggest that the scientific community concentrates research efforts on tree legumes, due to their resilience and physiological, nutritional, and culinary qualities.","We revealed critical vulnerabilities of nutrient content claims under FDA per serving size (serving), CAC per 100 g or mL, CAC per serving, and CAC per 100 kcal and developed the proposed method to remove all vulnerabilities. We calculated the nutrient content of foods based on nutrient content claims under the proposed method. Then, we determined nutrient content claims for foods and food groups, and specified similarities between nutrient content claims in food groups. Also, we ranked foods and food groups based on met claims of the nutrient content. Nutrient content claims based on the proposed method, including free, very low, low, source, and high claims were determined in 8596 food items, 29 nutrients, and 25 food groups of the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, release 28. Source and high claims are used for positive nutrients (including vitamins, minerals except sodium, protein, and dietary fiber). The very low claim is used for sodium, and free and low claims are used for cholesterol, energy, saturated fat, sodium, and total fat (also known as negative nutrients). In general, critical vulnerabilities of nutrient content claims under FDA and CAC can cause: (1) excessive energy intake based on FDA and CAC per serving and CAC per 100 g or mL; (2) exceeding the DV (NRV) for low nutrients under FDA per serving and CAC per 100 g or mL by consuming small amounts of foods per day; (3) the presence of nutrient free, but not low nutrient, foods based on FDA per serving and CAC per 100 g or mL; (4) the calculation of nutrient content in inappropriate amounts of foods based on FDA per serving, CAC per 100 g or mL, CAC per 100 kcal, and CAC per serving; and (5) determination of energy from total fat and saturated fat for relevant claims in inappropriate portions based on FDA per serving and CAC per 100 g or mL. Breakfast cereals, baby foods, pork products, lamb, veal, and game products, poultry products, and beef products had the highest average of scores for source and high nutrients. Restaurant foods, fast foods, and sausages and luncheon meats had the lowest average of scores for free, very low, and low nutrients. Nutrient source or high nutrient foods for all 24 positive nutrients were found in seven food groups (American Indian/Alaska Native foods; baby foods; beverages; dairy and egg products; legumes and legume products; meals, entrees, and side dishes; vegetables and vegetable products). There were very few source and high foods for potassium and vitamin D. Also, there were very few energy free foods.","","Background Nutrition is a modifiable risk factor for ischemic stroke. As people age their ability to absorb some nutrients decreases, an example is vitamin B12. Older individuals with a vitamin B12 deficiency are at a higher risk for stroke and have worse outcome. However, the mechanisms through which these occur remain unknown.","","Background The identification of effective strategies capable of reducing the case mortality rate of high-risk COVID-19 is an urgent and unmet medical need. We recently reported the clinical safety profile of RJX, a well-defined intravenous GMP-grade pharmaceutical formulation of anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory vitamins as active ingredients, in a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03680105) (Uckun et al., Front. Pharmacol. 11, 594321. 10.3389/fphar.2020.594321). Here we report data from a pilot clinical study (RPI-015) which examined the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of using RJX in combination with clinical standard of care (SOC) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with pneumonia (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04708340). In addition to our early clinical proof of concept (POC) data, we also present non-clinical POC from a mouse model of CRS and ARDS that informed the design of the reported clinical study.","Objectives To the best of our knowledge, there is no published study regarding use of IFN \u03b2-1a in the treatment of severe COVID-19. In this randomized clinical trial efficacy and safety of IFN \u03b2-1a has been evaluated in patients with severe COVID-19.","","Operative and conservative treatment of wrist fractures might lead to complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) type I. In our multicenter dose response study in which patients with distal radial fractures were randomly allocated to placebo or vitamin C in a daily dose of 200mg, 500mg or 1500mg during 50 days, an operated subgroup was analyzed. 48 (of 427) fractures) were operated (11.2%). Twenty-nine patients (60%) were treated with external fixation, 14 patients (29%) with K-wiring according to Kapandji and five patients (10%) with internal plate fixation. The 379 remaining patients were treated with a plaster. In the operated group of patients who received vitamin C no CRPS (0/37) was seen in comparison with one case of CRPS (Kapandji technique) in the operated group who received placebo (1/11 = 9%, p=.23). There was no CRPS after external fixation. In the conservatively treated group 17 cases of CRPS (17/379 = 4.5%) occurred in comparison with one in case of CRPS in the operated group (1/48 = 2.1%, p=.71). External fixation doesn't necessarily lead to a higher incidence of CRPS in distal radial fractures. Vitamin C may also play a role in this. This subgroup analysis in operated distal radial fractures showed no CRPS occurrence with vitamin C prophylaxis. ","Background: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease that typically progresses through four stages, from mild stiffness to severe disability. The critical involvement of gut microbial dysbiosis in promoting RA has been intriguing. The aim of this study was to investigate stage-specific roles of microbial dysbiosis and metabolic disorders in pathogenesis across successive stages of RA. Methods: In this multi-omics cohort study, fecal metagenomic, plasma metabolomic data were collected from 76 patients grouped into four RA stages, 19 patients with osteoarthritis, and 27 healthy individuals in China. A non-redundant gene catalogue was constructed, functionally annotated, and clustered into metagenomic species (MGS). Leave-one-out analysis was performed to determine the MGS that most drove the microbial dysfunctions with RA across stages. Random forest algorithm was performed to investigate diagnostic potential of microbial or metabolic features for each stage. Additionally, to verify the bacterial invasion of the joint synovial fluid, we conducted 16S rRNA gene sequencing, bacterial isolation, and scanning electron microscopy on joint synovial fluid from another cohort of 271 RA patients grouped into four RA stages. Findings: We found that microbial dysbiosis and metabolic disorders had stage-specific effects on RA progression. For instance, arginine succinyltransferase pathway was elevated mainly in the second and third stages of RA (p=1.4E-03), which was driven by Escherichia coli, and it was correlated with the increase of the rheumatoid factor (p=1.35E-03). Considerable elevation of methoxyacetic acid (p=1.28E-08) and cysteine-S-sulfate (p=4.66E-12) might inhibit osteoblasts in the second stage and enhance osteoclasts in the third stage, respectively. Moreover, fecal microbes Eggerthella lenta and Bifidobacterium longum that were exclusively elevated in the fourth stage, were also detected in the joint synovial fluid. Interpretation: Our findings elucidate for the first time the stage-specific roles of microbial dysbiosis and metabolic disorders across successive stages of RA, which open up new avenues for RA prognosis and therapy. We demonstrate the buildup of these effects might induce microbial invasion of the joint synovial fluid in the fourth stage of RA.","Chemical-induced gene expression profiles provide critical information on the mode of action, off-target effect, and cellar heterogeneity of chemical actions in a biological system, thus offer new opportunities for drug discovery, system pharmacology, and precision medicine. Despite their successful applications in drug repurposing, large-scale analysis that leverages these profiles is limited by sparseness and low throughput of the data. Several methods have been proposed to predict missing values in gene expression data. However, most of them focused on imputation and classification settings which have limited applications to real-world scenarios of drug discovery. Therefore, a new deep learning framework named chemical-induced gene expression ranking (CIGER) is proposed to target a more realistic but more challenging setting in which the model predicts the rankings of genes in the whole gene expression profiles induced by de novo chemicals. The experimental results show that CIGER significantly outperforms existing methods in both ranking and classification metrics for this prediction task. Furthermore, a new drug screening pipeline based on CIGER is proposed to select approved or investigational drugs for the potential treatments of pancreatic cancer. Our predictions have been validated by experiments, thereby showing the effectiveness of CIGER for phenotypic compound screening of precision drug discovery in practice.","Aggressive immune response, due to over-expressed pro-inflammatory molecules, had been characterized in COVID-19 patients. Some of those mediators have a dual and opposite role on immune-systems to play behind differential disease severities. We investigated the expression of some cytokines and chemokines in COVID-19 patients in Bangladesh. We diagnosed the patients by detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasal swab samples by the real-time RT-PCR method. Thirty adult patients were preselected based on their disease severities and grouped into mild, moderate, and severe cases. Nine healthy volunteers participated in this study as control. Relative expression of nine cytokines/chemokine in total leukocytes was semi-quantified in SYBRgreen-based qRT-PCR. We performed statistical tests on transformed log data using SPSS 24.0. At the onset of symptoms (day-1), ACE2 (P &lt; 0.05) and IL-6 (P &gt; 0.05) were up-regulated in all COVID-19 groups, although expression levels did not significantly correlate with disease severities. However, expression of IL-6, MCP-1, MIP-1\u03b1, TNF-\u03b1, RANTES, and ACE2, on day-14, were positively correlated with disease severities. Relative viral load at day-1 showed no significant correlation with cytokine expression but had a significant positive correlation with RANTES and ACE2 expression on day-14 (P &lt; 0.05). Male patients had a higher level of IL-6 than female patients on day-1 (P &lt; 0.05). All COVID-19 patients showed up-regulated cytokines and chemokines on the day-14 compared to day-1 except TNF-\u03b1. Female patients had higher expression of ACE2 and IL-12 on day-14. Up-regulated cytokines/chemokines at the convalescent stage, especially IL-6, may target anti-cytokine therapy in post-COVID-19 patients\u2019 management.","Several studies suggest the involvement of dietary habits and gut microbiome in allergic diseases. However, little is known about the nutritional and gut microbial factors associated with the risk of allergic rhinitis (AR). We recruited 186 apparently healthy workers with symptoms of AR and 106 controls at the Hitachi Health Care Center, Japan. The habitual consumption of 42 selected nutrients were examined using the brief-type self-administered diet history questionnaire. Faecal samples were collected and subjected to amplicon sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene hypervariable regions. Association analysis revealed that four nutrients (retinol, vitamin A, cryptoxanthin, and copper) were negatively associated with AR. Among 40 genera examined, relative abundance of Prevotella and Escherichia were associated with AR. Furthermore, significant statistical interactions were observed between retinol and Prevotella. The age- and sex-adjusted odds of AR were 25-fold lower in subjects with high retinol intake and high Prevotella abundance compared to subjects with low retinol intake and low Prevotella abundance. Our data provide insights into complex interplay between dietary nutrients, gut microbiome, and the development of AR.","Our study employed the detection of 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine (5hmC) profiles on cell free DNA (cfDNA) from the plasma of cancer patients using a novel enrichment technology coupled with sequencing and machine learning based classification method. These classification methods were develoiped to detect the presence of disease in the plasma of cancer and control subjects. Cancer and control patient cfDNA cohorts were accrued from multiple sites consisting of 48 breast, 55 lung, 32 prostate and 53 pancreatic cancer subjects. In addition, a control cohort of 180 subjects (non-cancer) was employed to match cancer patient demographics (age, sex and smoking status) in a case-control study design.","","","Sea cucumbers Apostichopus japonicus (3.54 \u00b1 0.01 g of wet weight) were exposed to five concentrations of dietary hexavalent chromium [0 (control), 100, 200, 400, and 800 mg Cr6+/kg dry weight] amended with K2Cr2O7 for 30 days. The bioaccumulation and immune responses [antioxidant enzymes: superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT); hydrolytic enzymes: acid phosphatase (ACP) and alkaline phosphatase (AKP)] of sea cucumbers were subsequently evaluated. This study found that the order of Cr accumulation in the experimental tissues was respiratory tree &gt; intestine &gt; body wall. Significantly lower SOD activities occurred in the 400 mg/kg group compared to that in the control group. Higher dietary Cr6+ exposure (400 and 800 mg Cr6+ /kg dry weight) did not negatively alter the CAT activities, but significantly inhibited CAT activities in 100 mg/kg group, compared to control group. ACP activities in groups 200, 400 and 800 mg/kg were significantly lower than those in control group, while no significant differences occurred in AKP activities among groups. The present study provides important information into the bioaccumulation and immune responses of the sea cucumber A. japonicus in response to chronic dietary Cr6+ exposure.","","In the routine laboratory, 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF) is the fixative of choice. However, formalin is a human carcinogen. To the best of our knowledge, neutral honey, not natural or artificial honey, has not been tested to fix histological tissues. This study aimed to examine the efficiency of neutral buffered honey and other types of honey fixatives to fix histological tissues. The most two natural common Omani honey were used as fixatives, namely Sumar and date. We tested samples of rat liver, kidney, and stomach. Nine types of fixatives were used. All tissues were treated equally. The evaluation was performed blindly by three senior biomedical scientists who work in a histopathology laboratory. Hematoxylin and eosin showed adequate staining in all groups when compared to 10% NBF. The intensity and specificity of Jones Methenamine silver stain in 10% Sumer and Date honey and 10% alcoholic Sumer honey showed similar findings of 10% NBF. The specificity and intensity of all groups for Periodic acid\u2013Schiff were comparable with 10% neutral buffered formalin accepts for 10% Sumer honey and 10% Alcoholic Date honey. However, all honey groups showed weak staining for the reticulin fibers using Gordon and Sweets method. Vimentin showed comparable findings with 10% NBF as there were no significant differences. The findings of this study are promising. Further in depth research on honey as a possible safe substitute fixative for formalin should be conducted.","Elucidating the mechanism of reprogramming is confounded by heterogeneity due to the low efficiency and differential kinetics of obtaining induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from somatic cells. Therefore, we increased the efficiency with a novel combination of epigenetic and signaling molecules and profiled the transcriptomes of individual reprogramming cells. Contrary to the established temporal order, somatic gene inactivation and upregulation of cell cycle, epithelial, and early pluripotency genes can be triggered independently such that any combination of these events can occur in single cells. Sustained co-expression of Epcam, Nanog, and Sox2 with other genes is required to progress towards iPSCs. Ehf, Phlda2, and translation initiation factor Eif4a1 play novel functional roles in robust iPSC generation. Using regulatory network analysis, we identify a critical role for signaling inhibition by 2i in repressing somatic expression and synergy between the epigenetic modifiers ascorbic acid and a Dot1L inhibitor for pluripotency gene activation.","Here, we demonstrate that the two distinct formulations of our anti-sepsis drug candidate Rejuveinix (RJX) have a very favorable safety profile in Wistar Albino rats at dose levels comparable to the projected clinical dose levels. 14-day treatment with RJX-P or RJX-B similarly elevated the day 15 tissue levels of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) as well as ascorbic acid in both the lungs and liver in a dose-dependent fashion. The activity of SOD and ascorbic acid levels were significantly higher in tissues of RJX-P or RJX-B treated rats than vehicle-treated control rats (p &lt;0.0001). There was no statistically significant difference between tissues SOD activity or ascorbic acid levels of rats treated with RJX-P vs. rats treated with RJX-B (p &gt;0.05). The observed elevations of the SOD and ascorbic acid levels were transient and were no longer detectable on day 28 following a 14-day recovery period. These results demonstrate that RJX-P and RJX-B are bioequivalent relative to their pharmacodynamic effects on tissue SOD and ascorbic acid levels.","The dose dependent depletion of ovarian Ascorbic acid (AA) in rat ovaries, has been used as a bioassay for measurement of Luteinizing Hormone (LH). However, the mechanism of action of gonadotropin (LH, FSH) on ascorbic acid depletion is not completely clear in biochemical terms. To elucidate the mechanism, we looked for the pathways; one, where L-Gulonate Dehydrogenase (L-GuDH) catalyzes the conversion of L-Gulonic acid (L-GuA) to L-Xylulose, and, in the second the pathway conversion of L-GuA to AA, in a cats, dogs and Rats. Kinetic analysis of the enzyme L-GuDH in vitro showed the inhibitory effect of AA on L-GuDH. Therefore, we hypothesized that gonadotropins (FSH and LH) may regulate the L-GuDH maintain level of AA in ovary. LH administration to super-ovulated immature female rats caused depletion of ovarian AA but did not result in any change in the specific activity of the ovarian L-GuDH. Further, we administrated a surrogate FSH like hormone (PMSG) to immature female rats which, resulted in increased specific activity of ovarian L-GuDH. However, microarray data on RNA from ovaries exposed to FSH like hormone such as Pregnant Mare serum Gonadotropin (PMSG) did not reveal any increased expression of L-GuDH transcript. It is therefore concluded from the results obtained that; that neither LH, in decreasing the ovarian AA, nor FSH, in increasing the ovarian AA do so by regulating the activity of enzyme L-GuDH at transcriptional level. The results obtained have also been discussed by giving emphasis on the mechanism of ovarian ascorbic acid regulation of LH and FSH.","The purpose of this study is to elucidate the apoptotic activity of Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharide (GLP) in a human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 in vitro. According to DPPH assay, GLP showed a good antioxidant (IC50 value is 202.4 \u03bcg/mL). Based on MTT assay, the results showed that GLP inhibits MCF-7 cells proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner (p&lt;0.001). IC50 values of the cytotoxicity of GLP and doxorubin were 110.907 \u03bcg/mL and 58.206 \u03bcg/mL respectively. The results from the flow cytometry indicated that GLP could induce apoptotic activity through inducing the up-regulation of the Bax and Caspase-9 and the down-regulation of the BcL-2 in MCF-7 cells. At 2\u00d7IC50, GLP increased the early-apoptotic and dead cells of MCF-7 from 18.23% to 34.76% and 8.45% to16.34% respectively. In conclusion, the GLP shows anticancer activity against MCF-7 through preventing the proliferation and inducing the apoptosis of MCF-7 cells. Our data provide the potential molecular targets in cancer prevention and reveal the key barriers in the current anticancer drugs development.","Cancer of gastrointestinal tract, such as colorectal cancer (CRC) and gastric cancer (GC), are common types of cancer globally and their origin can be linked to oxidative stress conditions. Commonly available antioxidants, such as vitamins C and E, are widely considered as potential anti-cancer agents. Raman spectra have great potential in the biochemical characterization of matter based on the fact that each molecule has its own unique vibrational properties. Raman spectroscopy allows to precisely characterized cell substructures (nucleus, mitochondria, cytoplasm, cell membrane) and components (proteins, lipids, nucleic acids).","Investigations on the human germline and programming are challenging due to limited access to embryonic material. However, the pig as a model may provide insight on transcriptional network and epigenetic reprogramming applicable to both species. Here we show that during the pre- and early migratory stages pig primordial germ cells (PGCs) initiate large-scale epigenetic reprogramming, including DNA demethylation involving TET-mediated hydroxylation and potentially base excision repair (BER). There is also macroH2A1 depletion and increased H3K27me3, as well as X chromosome reactivation (XCR) in females. Concomitantly, there is dampening of glycolytic metabolism genes and re-expression of some pluripotency genes like those in preimplantation embryos. We identified evolutionarily young transposable elements and gene coding regions resistant to DNA demethylation in acutely hypomethylated gonadal PGCs, with potential for transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. Detailed insights into the pig germline will likely contribute significantly to advances in human germline biology, including in vitro gametogenesis.","","Many embryonic organs undergo epithelial morphogenesis to form tree-like hierarchical structures. However, it remains unclear what drives the budding and branching of stratified epithelia, such as in embryonic salivary gland and pancreas. Here, we performed live-organ imaging of mouse embryonic salivary glands at single-cell resolution to reveal that budding morphogenesis is driven by expansion and folding of a distinct epithelial surface cell sheet characterized by strong cell-matrix adhesions and weak cell-cell adhesions. Profiling of single-cell transcriptomes of this epithelium revealed spatial patterns of transcription underlying these cell adhesion differences. We then synthetically reconstituted budding morphogenesis by experimentally suppressing E-cadherin expression and inducing basement membrane formation in 3D spheroid cultures of engineered cells, which required \u03b21 integrin-mediated cell-matrix adhesion for successful budding. Thus, stratified epithelial budding, the key first step of branching morphogenesis, is driven by an overall combination of strong cell-matrix adhesion and weak cell-cell adhesion by peripheral epithelial cells.","","A total of 6,628 PUBMED-registered publications on the relationships between the effects of vaccination and the provision of micronutrients have been studied by methods of topological analysis of text data. In case of insufficient intake of certain micronutrients, the functioning of the acquired immunity is disrupted resulting in an imbalance of populations of T-cells CD4+/CD8+ and of B-lymphocytes. Nutritional supplements of folate, vitamins A, D and B12, which are recognized regulators of cell division, support a wide range of lymphocyte populations. Trace elements zinc, iron, selenium, manganese and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are also important for supporting the mechanisms of acquired immunity. The data presented show that a course intake of these micronutrients by patients planning vaccination can significantly improve its effectiveness. In particular, these micronutrients can increase the titers of antibodies to pathogens, and to reduce the percentage of patients who still contract infection after vaccination. Supplements of these micronutrients can also contribute to the safety of vaccination: to prevent malaise and, in the unfortunate case of contracting infection despite the vaccine, to reduce the severity of the course and the mortality from the corresponding infection.","One of the most important areas of medical science is oncology, which is responsible for both the diagnostics and treatment of cancer diseases. Simultaneously one of the main challenges of oncology is the development of modern drugs effective in the fight against cancer. Statins are a group of biologically active compounds with the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors, an enzyme catalyzing the reduction of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) to mevalonic acid. By acting on this enzyme, statins inhibit the endogenous cholesterol synthesis which in turn causes the reduction of its systemic concentrations. However, in vitro and in vivo studies confirm also the cytostatic and cytotoxic effects of statins against various types of cancer cells including colon cancer. In the presented studies the influence of mevastatin on cancerous colon cells CaCo-2 by Raman spectroscopy and imaging is discussed and compared with biochemistry characteristic for normal colon cells CCD-18Co. Based on vibrational features of colon cells: normal cells CCD-18Co, cancerous cells CaCo-2 and cancerous cells CaCo-2 treated by mevastatin in different concentrations and incubation times we have confirm the influence of this statin on biochemistry composition of cancerous human colon cells. Moreover, the spectroscopic results for colon normal cells and cancerous cells based on data typical for nucleic acids, proteins, lipids have been compared. The cytotoxisity of mevastatin was determined by using XTT tests.","  It is known that the primary source of dietary vitamin C is fruit and\nvegetables and the plasma level of vitamin C has been considered a good\nsurrogate biomarker of vitamin C intake by fruit and vegetable consumption. To\ncombine the information about association between vitamin C intake and the\nplasma level of vitamin C, numerical approximation methods for likelihood\nfunction of correlation coefficient are studied. The least squares approach is\nused to estimate a log-likelihood function by a function from a space of\nB-splines having desirable mathematical properties. The likelihood interval\nfrom the Highest Likelihood Regions (HLR) is used for further inference. This\napproach can be easily extended to the realm of meta-analysis involving sample\ncorrelations from different studies by use of an approximated combined\nlikelihood function. The sample correlations between vitamin C intake and serum\nlevel of vitamin C from many studies are used to illustrate application of this\napproach.\n","Mitochondria are multifaceted organelles which are important for bioenergetics, biosynthesis and signaling in metazoans. Mitochondrial functions are frequently altered in cancer to promote both the energy and the necessary metabolic intermediates for biosynthesis required for tumor growth. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) contribute to chemotherapy resistance, relapse, and metastasis. Recent studies have shown that while non-stem, bulk cancer cells utilize glycolysis, breast CSCs are more dependent on oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) and therefore targeting mitochondria may inhibit CSC function. We previously reported that small molecule ONC201, which is an agonist for the mitochondrial caseinolytic protease (ClpP), induces mitochondrial dysfunction in breast cancer cells. In this study, we report that ClpP agonists inhibit breast cancer CSC function in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we found that OxPhos inhibition downregulates multiple pathways required for CSC function, such as the mevalonate pathway, YAP, Myc, and the HIF pathway. ClpP agonists showed significantly greater inhibitory effect on CSC functions compared with other mitochondria-targeting drugs. Further studies showed that ClpP agonists deplete NAD(P)+ and NAD(P)H and induce redox imbalance, and dysregulate one-carbon metabolism and proline biosynthesis. Downregulation of these pathways by ClpP agonists further contribute to the inhibition of CSC function. In conclusion, ClpP agonists inhibit breast CSC functions by disrupting mitochondrial homeostasis in breast cancer cells and inhibiting multiple pathways critical to CSC function.","Colorectal cancer is the second most frequently diagnosed cancer worldwide. Conventional diagnostics methods of colorectal cancer, can detect it in advanced stage.","Studies on strategies to generate cardioprotective effects have been on the rise. Previous work by our group with an ex vivo model of ischemia/reperfusion has shown that both the short-term consumption of yerba mate and exercise can each induce protection of cardiac function independently. Surprising, the two strategies together do not, with an apparent loss of their respective cardioprotection activity. To improve our understanding of the mechanisms involved without reperforming the experiments, we have conducted a retrospective data science-analysis that have produced new insights. The analysis shows that yerba mate generated reductive stress. Alone, this stress increased redox damage in the heart that appears to have led to a protective conditioning. In combination with exercise, the effects of mate inhibited the intermittent ROS generation promoted by exercise alone, which diminished the adaptive response in the heart. These results suggest that an understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved with the yerba mate-promoted reductive stress in cardiac tissue could lead to improved strategies to induce cardioprotection.","Therapy with radiation plus cisplatin kills human papilloma virus-related (HPV+) oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCCs) by increasing reactive oxygen species beyond cellular antioxidant capacity. To explore why some patients fail these standard treatments, we evaluated whether the variation in HPV oncoprotein levels among HPV+ OPSCCs impacts mitochondrial metabolism, a source of antioxidant capacity. In cell line and patient-derived xenograft models, levels of HPV full-length E6 (fl-E6) inversely correlated with oxidative phosphorylation, antioxidant capacity, and therapy resistance, and fl-E6 was the only HPV oncoprotein to display such correlation. Ectopically expressing fl-E6 in models with low levels reduced mitochondrial mass, depleted antioxidant capacity, and sensitized to therapy. In this setting, fl-E6 repressed the PGC-1\u03b1/ERR\u03b1 pathway for mitochondrial biogenesis by reducing p53-dependent PGC-1\u03b1 transcription. Concordant observations were made in three clinical cohorts, where expression of mitochondrial components was higher in tumors of patients with reduced survival. These tumors contained the lowest fl-E6 levels, highest p53 target gene expression, and an activated PGC-1\u03b1/ERR\u03b1 pathway. Our findings demonstrate that E6 can potentiate treatment responses by depleting mitochondrial antioxidant capacity and provide evidence for low E6 negatively impacting patient survival. E6\u2019s interaction with the PGC-1\u03b1/ERR\u03b1 axis has implications for predicting and targeting treatment resistance in OPSCC.","Bisphenol-A (BPA) and its analog are extensively utilized in the production of plastics which are rather ubiquitous in our environment. At high temperatures, BPA is leached into water and food packed in plastic containers. This research investigated the ameliorative effects of CMSO on adipokines dysfunction and dyslipidemia in male Wistar rats exposed to Bisphenol-A. thirty-six (36) albino rats weighing 100 - 200 g were randomly assigned into six (6) different experimental groups of controls (1, 2, and 3) and the tests (4, 5, and 6). Group 1 was given only 1 ml of olive oil, group 2 received 100 mg/Kg body weight (b.w) of BPA, group 3 was given 7.5 ml/Kg b.w of CMSO, groups 4, 5, and 6 received 100 mg/Kg b.w of BPA and 7.5, 5 and 2.5 mg/Kg b.w of CMSO respectively. CMSO and BPA were concurrently administered via oral intubation for periods of 42 days. Lipid profile and adipokines levels were determined in plasma and adipose tissue. BPA in male rats significantly (p&lt;0.05) elevated the levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL-C, liptin, and coronary and atherogenic risk indices in plasma and adipose tissue with reductions in HDL-C and adiponectin levels. BPA plus CMSO in male rats significantly (p&lt;0.05) decreased the levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL-C, liptin, and coronary and atherogenic risk indices with an elevation of HDL-C and adiponectin levels in both plasma and adipose tissue. These results suggest that CMSO could be useful in the management of cardiovascular-related diseases induced by BPA.","Single-cell sequencing enables us to better understand genetic diseases, such as cancer or autoimmune disorders, which are often affected by changes in rare cells. Currently, no existing software is aimed at identifying single nucleotide variations or micro (1-50bp) insertions and deletions in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Generating high-quality variant data is vital to the study of the aforementioned diseases, among others. In this study, we report the design and implementation of Red Panda, a novel method to accurately identify variants in scRNA-seq data. Variants were called on scRNA-seq data from human articular chondrocytes, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), and simulated data stemming from the MEF alignments. Red Panda had the highest Positive Predictive Value at 45.0%, while other tools\u2014FreeBayes, GATK HaplotypeCaller, GATK UnifiedGenotyper, Monovar, and Platypus\u2014ranged from 5.8%-41.53%. From the simulated data, Red Panda had the highest sensitivity at 72.44%. We show that our method provides a novel and improved mechanism to identify variants in scRNA-seq as compared to currently-existing software.","","Introduction Covid-19 vaccines can cause adverse events (AE) that can lead to increased hesitation or fear of vaccination. This study aims at estimating the prevalence of severe adverse events (SAEs) and their associated factors among health professionals (HPs) vaccinated with COVISHIELD\u2122 vaccine in Togo.","Recent reports have proposed a new paradigm for obtaining mature somatic cell types from fibroblasts without going through a pluripotent state, by briefly expressing canonical iPSC reprogramming factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc (abbreviated as OSKM) in cells expanded in lineage differentiation promoting conditions. Here we apply genetic lineage tracing for endogenous Nanog locus and X chromosome reactivation during OSKM induced trans-differentiation, as these molecular events mark final stages for acquisition of induced pluripotency. Remarkably, the majority of reprogrammed cardiomyocytes or neural stem cells derived from mouse fibroblasts via OSKM mediated trans-differentiation (\u223c&gt;90%), are attained after transient acquisition of pluripotency, and followed by rapid differentiation. Our findings underscore a molecular and functional coupling between inducing pluripotency and obtaining \u201ctrans-differentiated\u201d somatic cells via OSKM induction, and have implications on defining molecular trajectories assumed during different cell reprogramming methods.","The chemopreventive activity of celecoxib against colorectal cancer is limited to a proportion of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients who experience a response. The cause of this response variability and the potential mechanisms underlying these responses remain poorly understood. Preclinical studies showed that celecoxib increases the production of main oxidative metabolism product of linoleic acid, 13-S-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-S-HODE), to suppress colorectal tumorigenesis. We conducted a phase II clinical study to determine whether celecoxib increases 13-S-HODE production in colonic adenomas from FAP patients. Twenty seven FAP patients completed a 6-month oral course of 400 mg of celecoxib twice a day and had colonoscopies before and after celecoxib treatment to assess colorectal polyp tumor burden and obtain colorectal normal and polyp biopsies to measure celecoxib, 13-HODE, 15-HETE, 12-HETE, and LTB4 levels by LC/MS. Celecoxib levels in sera from those patients were also measured before treatment and 2, 4, and 6 months of treatment. Seventeen of the 27 patients experienced a response to celecoxib, with a more than 30% reduction of colonic polyp burden on the basis of a reproducible quantitative assessment of colonoscopy results. Celecoxib levels were significantly lower in polyp tissues than in normal colorectal tissues. Celecoxib levels in sera and normal colorectal tissues were correlated in patients who experienced a response to celecoxib but not in those who did not. Among the measured lipoxygenase products, only 13-HODE levels were significantly lower in polyp tissues than in normal tissues. Our findings demonstrate the differential bioavailability of celecoxib between normal and polyp tissues and its potential effects on clinical response in FAP patients.","Machine learning-based clinical decision support tools for sepsis create opportunities to identify at-risk patients and initiate treatments earlier, critical to improving sepsis outcomes. Increasing use of such systems necessitates quantifying and understanding provider adoption. Using real-time provider interactions with a sepsis early detection tool (Targeted Real-time Early Warning System) deployed at five hospitals over a two-year period (469,419 screened encounters, 9,805 (2.1%) retrospectively-identified sepsis cases), we found high sensitivity (82% of sepsis cases identified), high adoption rates (89% of alerts evaluated by a physician or advanced practice provider and 38% of evaluated alerts confirmed) and an association between use of the tool and earlier treatment of sepsis patients (1.85 (95% CI:1.66-2.00) hour reduction in median time to first antibiotics order). Further, we found that provider-related factors were strongly associated with adoption. Beyond improving system performance, efforts to improve adoption should focus on provider knowledge, experience, and perceptions of the system.","","The most effective means for denitrifying products and fat oxidation processes is to prevent contamination of grain at all stages of cultivation, processing and storage. If it was not possible to prevent these processes, it is necessary to use preparations that reduce the harmful effects of nitrates, mycotoxins and peroxides. These include antioxidants, adsorbents. The aim of the research was to study the efficiency of use in diets containing a subtoxic dose of nitrates, adsorbent preparations ofSantochinum and Mold-Zap to increase the productivity, physicochemical and technological characteristics of milk of lactating cows. To achieve this goal, scientific and economic experiment was conducted on cows of the Swiss breed.Of the 40 cows, according to the method of analoguepairs, 4 groups of 10 animals each were formed. The combined use of preparations of Santochinum at a dose of 0.5 kg/t and Mold-Zap at a dose of 1.5 kg/t of compound feed contributed to an increase in the milk of cows of the 3rd experimental group, as compared to the control analogues, of the fat content by 0.21%, protein - by 0.17%, density - by 0.61\u00b0A, dry matter by 0.48%, vitamin C by 48.2%, vitamin A by 51.9% with a simultaneous decrease in the nitrate content by 45.1% and nitrite - by 55, 3%. Regarding the control, the milk of the cows of the 3rd experimental group had more fat globules by 11.9%, but with a smaller diameter - by 17.4%.The addition of these preparations to the diets of cows of the 3rd experimental grou, contributed to an increase in protein milk by 0.21%, the proportion of casein - by 0.31%, and \u03b1-casein - by 4.56%.Inthe sample of cheese from milk of cows of the 3rdexperimental group, there was an increase in the concentration of dry matter by 1.68%, protein in the dry matter - by 1.31%. After homogenization, in the milk of cows of the 3rd experimental group, the nitrate reductase activity of xanthine oxidase exceeded 2.36 times the sample of production of cows in the control group. This technological technique contributed to the stabilization of pH=5.17 in milk, which activates the process of reducing nitrates and nitrites to ammonia. The lowest concentration of nitrates and nitrites was in the sample of cheese from the milk of animals of the 3rd experimental group, exceeding in these parameters the control sample by 68.5 and 70.0%.","Objectives To summarize the effects of intravenous corticosteroid treatment for sepsis defined by the Sepsis-3 criteria in adult patients.","INTRODUCTION Due to the spread of SARS CoV-2 virus responsible for COVID-19 disease, there is an urgent need to analyse COVID-2019 epidemic perception in Poland. This study aims to investigate social perception of coronavirus in the Internet media during the epidemic. It is a signal report highlighting the main issues in public perception and medical commutation in real time.","Background Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination vary for reasons that remain poorly understood.","Acetylcholine (ACh), a key neurochemical messenger that plays key roles in neuroplasticity and muscle contraction. While ACh is important for the physiological function of the testis, abnormal levels of ACh cause testicular atrophy and male infertility. BOTOX is a therapeutic form of the botulinum neurotoxin that blocks the excessive release of ACh at the neuromuscular junction. Previously, repeated intracremasteric injections and slight overdose of BOTOX have been reported to induce adverse effects in the testicular parameter of experimental rodents. However, a mild dose of BOTOX is highly beneficial against skin ageing, neurological deficits, overactive urinary bladder problems, testicular pain and erectile dysfunctions. Considering the facts, the possible therapeutic benefit of BOTOX on the testis might be achieved via its minimal dose and indirect mode of action rather than repeated high quantity in the local supply. Therefore, we revisited the effect of BOTOX but with a trace amount injected into the vastus lateralis of the thigh muscle, and analyzed histological parameters of testis and quality of semen in ageing experimental mice. Experimental animals injected with 1 U/kg bodyweight of BOTOX showed enhanced spermatogenesis in associations with increased activities of key antioxidants in the testis, leading to increased total sperm count and motility. This study signifies that a mild intramuscular dose of BOTOX can be considered as a potential treatment strategy to manage and prevent male infertility.","The pathways of signaling molecules are important to understanding how signaling molecules regulate physiological function and also in predicting the pathological development which is important to therapeutic strategy, however the thorough knowledge of these pathways is still lack. In this paper, we used the big data concept to analyze the pathways of signaling molecules and categorize these molecules into five groups according to their origin and effect on the five organs of heart-spleen-lung-kidney-liver. Heart group includes IGF, Ang and Mg; spleen group includes ANP, aldosterone, retinoic acid and ghrelin; lung group includes FGF7, VEGF, ascorbic acid and HIF; kidney group includes calcitonin, PTHrP, Wnt and NO; and liver group includes EPO, renin, SOD, AKR and GSH. We found that each group of molecules have assisting effect on the other organ in the order of heart-spleen-lung-kidney-liver-heart, and have regulating effect on the other organ in the order of heart-lung-liver-spleen-kidney-heart. Moreover, the pathways of molecules of each group also follow these two arrangements, in which the pathways of molecules form a closed-loop that may lead to new therapeutic strategies.","Attempts to improve the ascorbate (AsA) content of plants are still dealing with the limited understanding of why exists a wide variability of this powerful anti-oxidant molecule in different plant sources, species and environmental situations. In plant mitochondria, the last step of AsA synthesis is catalyzed by the enzyme L-galactone-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase (L-GalLDH). By using GalLDH-RNAi silencing plant lines, biochemical and proteomic approaches, we here discovered that, in addition to accumulate this antioxidant, mitochondria synthesize AsA to down-regulate the respiratory activity and the cellular energy provision. The work reveals that the AsA synthesis pathway within mitochondria is a branched electron transfer process that channels electrons towards the alternative oxidase, interfering with conventional electron transport. It was unexpectedly found that significant hydrogen peroxide is generated during AsA synthesis, which affects the AsA level. The induced AsA synthesis shows proteomic alterations of mitochondrial and extra-mitochondrial proteins related to oxidative and energetic metabolism. The most identified proteins were known components of plant responses to high light acclimation, programmed cell death, oxidative stress, senescence, cell expansion, iron and phosphorus starvation, different abiotic stress/pathogen attack responses and others. We propose that changing the electron flux associated with AsA synthesis might be part of a new mechanism by which the L-GalLDH enzyme would adapt plant mitochondria to fluctuating energy demands and redox status occurring under different physiological contexts.","Background Biomarkers such as oxidative stress, folate receptor alpha (FRa) autoimmunity, and abnormal brain serotonin turnover are common in autism. Methods Oxidative stress biomarkers with pro- and antioxidants were measured in the severe form of infantile autism (n = 38) and controls (n = 24). Children and parents had repeated testing for serum FR autoantibodies, spinal fluid dopamine and serotonin metabolites, pterins, and N5-methyltetrahydrofolate (MTHF). Statistical analysis assessed correlations between variables. Genetic analysis included the SLC6A4 and SLC29A4 genes encoding synaptic serotonin reuptake proteins. Results Compared to controls, the autism group showed a significant increase in oxidative DNA damage in lymphocytes, plasma ceruloplasmin and copper levels with a high copper/zinc ratio, thiol proteins, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Vitamin C levels were significantly diminished. In most autistic patients, the vitamin A (64%) and D (70%) levels were low. Serum FR autoantibodies fluctuating over 5-7 week periods presented in 68% of all autistic children, 41% of parents vs. 3.3% of control children and their parents. CSF showed lowered serotonin 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5HIAA) metabolites in 13 (34%), a low 5HIAA to HVA (dopamine metabolite) ratio in 5 (13%), low 5HIAA and MTHF in 2 (5%), and low MTHF in 8 patients (21%). A known SLC6A4 mutation was identified only in 1 autistic child with low CSF 5HIAA and a novel SLC29A4 mutation was identified in identical twins. Low CSF MTHF levels among only 26% of subjects can be explained by the fluctuating FR antibody titers. Two or more aberrant pro-oxidant and/or antioxidant factors predisposed to low CSF serotonin metabolites. Three autistic children having low CSF 5HIAA and elevated oxidative stress received antioxidative supplements followed by CSF 5HIAA normalisation. Conclusion In autism, we found diverse combinations for FR autoimmunity and/or oxidative stress, both amenable to treatment. Parental and postnatal FR autoantibodies tend to block folate passage to the brain affecting folate-dependent pathways restored by folinic acid treatment, while an abnormal redox status tends to induce reduced serotonin turnover, corrected by antioxidant therapy. Trial Registration. The case-controlled study was approved in 2008 by the IRB at Liege University (Belgian Number: B70720083916). Lay Summary. Children with severe infantile autism frequently have serum folate receptor autoantibodies that block the transport of the essential vitamin folate across the blood-brain barrier to the brain. Parents are often asymptomatic carriers of these serum folate receptor autoantibodies, which in mothers can block folate passage across the placenta to their unborn child. This folate deficiency during the child's intrauterine development may predispose to neural tube defects and autism. Oxidative stress represents a condition with the presence of elevated toxic oxygen derivatives attributed to an imbalance between the formation and protection against these toxic reactive oxygen derivatives. Oxidative stress was found to be present in autistic children where these reactive oxygen derivatives can cause damage to DNA, which changes DNA function and regulation of gene expression. In addition, excessive amounts of these toxic oxygen derivatives are likely to damage the enzyme producing the neuromessenger serotonin in the brain, diminished in about 1/3 of the autistic children. Testing children with autism for oxidative stress and its origin, as well as testing for serum folate receptor autoantibodies, could open new approaches towards more effective treatments. ","This study aims to systematically review and meta-analyze the nitro-oxidative stress (O&amp;NS)/antioxidant (ANTIOX) ratio in the peripheral blood of people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We searched PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science for articles published from inception until July 31, 2021. Forty-six studies on 3.798 MCI individuals and 6.063 healthy controls were included. The O&amp;NS/ANTIOX ratio was significantly higher in MCI than in controls with a Standardized Mean Difference (SMD)=0.378 (95% CI: 0.250; 0.506). MCI individuals showed increased lipid peroxidation (SMD=0.774, 95%CI: 4.416; 1.132) and O&amp;NS-associated toxicity (SMD=0.621, CI: 0.377; 0.865) and reduced glutathione (GSH) defenses (SMD=0.725, 95%CI: 0.269; 1.182) as compared with controls. MCI was also accompanied by significantly increased homocysteine (SMD=0.320, CI: 0.059; 0.581), but not protein oxidation, and lowered non-vitamin (SMD=0.347, CI: 0.168; 0.527) and vitamin (SMD=0.564, CI: 0.129; 0.999) antioxidant defenses. The results show that MCI is at least in part due to increased neuro-oxidative toxicity and suggest that treatments targeting lipid peroxidation and the GSH system may be used to treat or prevent MCI.","","Polysaccharides from natural sources play a significant role in the management of different cancer types including gastric cancer. In this study, we reported the effect of spirulina polysaccharide (Sp) on galectin-3 modulatory activity on gastric cancer cells. The polysaccharide was isolated from the spirulina biomass, characterized, and the in silico, in vitro studies are carried out to assess the bioactivities. The isolated Sp possessed average molecular weight of 1457 kDa, and galactose (42%) as major sugar along with Rhamnose, Arabinose, Xylose, and Mannose. Further, characterization of Sp by FT-IR and NMR spectrum indicated the presence of (\u03b21-4D) galactose sugar with galactoarabinorhamnoglycan backbone. Among the monosaccharides, galactose showed highest binding affinity with galectin-3 protein as evidenced by the in silico interaction study. The obtained Sp, inhibited the proliferation of AGS gastric cancer cells by 48 % without affecting normal NIH/3T3 cells as opposed to doxorubicin, a known anticancer drug. Also, Sp exhibited galectin-3 mediated haemagglutination inhibition with MIC of 9.37 \u03bcg/mL compared to galactose 6.25 \u03bcg/mL, sugar specific to galectin-3. The Sp treatment significantly (p&lt;0.05) lowered the expression of galectin-3 by 32 % compared to untreated control cells. In addition, Sp exhibited the potent cytoprotection in RBCs, Buccal cells, and DNA exposed to oxidants. Thus, the findings suggest that the polysaccharide from spirulina offer a promising therapeutic strategy in the management of gastric cancer in addition to its currently known nutritional and pharmaceutical applications.","Breast cancer (BC) remains one of the deadliest and frequently diagnosed metastatic cancers worldwide. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are the cell population within the tumour niche, having an epithelial to mesenchymal (EMT) transition phenotype, high self-renewal, vigorous metastatic capacity, drug resistance, and tumour relapse. Identification of targets for induction of apoptosis is essential to provide novel therapeutic approaches in BC. Our earlier studies showed that Vitamin C induces apoptotic cell death by losing redox balance in TNBC CSCs. In this study, we have attempted to identify previously unrecognized CSC survival factors that can be used as druggable targets for bCSCs apoptosis regulators isolated from the TNBC line, MDA MB 468. After a thorough literature review, Oct-4 was identified as the most promising marker for its unique abundance in cancer and absence in normal cells and the contribution of Oct-4 to the sustenance of cancer cells. We then validated a very high expression of Oct-4 in the MDA MB 468 bCSCs population using flow-cytometry. The loss of Oct-4 was carried out using siRNA-mediated knockdown in the bCSCs, followed by assessing for cellular apoptosis. Our results indicated that Oct-4 knockdown induced cell death, changes in cellular morphology, inhibited mammosphere formation, and positive for Annexin-V expression, thereby indicating the role of Oct-4 in bCSC survival. Moreover, our findings also suggest the direct interaction between Oct-4 and Vitamin C using in silico docking. This data, hence, contributes towards novel information about Oct-4 highlighting this molecule as a novel survival factor in bCSCs.","","Background SARS-CoV-2 infection has severely ravaged health systems, economic and social progress globally in 2020. Seroprevalence studies can provide relevant information on the target populations for vaccination. They are relevant not only in the community, but also for critical population subgroups such as nursing homes or health care facilities. They will assist in strategizing the vaccination policy especially since there is limited availability of the vaccine and vaccine hesitancy","Introduction High-dose vitamin C (hdVC) is regarded as one of the essential adjunctive drugs for sepsis treatment. The present study aimed to deduce if hdVC could lead to erroneous testing results from the point-of-care glucose (POCG) measurement.","Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and frequently leads to massive heart injury and the loss of billions of cardiac muscle cells and associated vasculature. Critical work in the last two decades demonstrated that these lost cells can be partially regenerated by the epicardium, the outermost mesothelial layer of the heart, in a process that highly recapitulates its role in heart development. Upon cardiac injury, mature epicardial cells activate and undergo an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to form epicardial-derived progenitor cells (EpiPCs), multipotent progenitors that can differentiate into several important cardiac lineages, including cardiomyocytes and vascular cells. In mammals, this process alone is insufficient for significant regeneration, but it might be possible to prime it by administering specific reprogramming factors, leading to enhanced EpiPC function. Here, we show that oxytocin (OXT), a hypothalamic neuroendocrine peptide, induces epicardial cell proliferation, EMT, and migration in a model of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived epicardial cells. In addition, we demonstrate that OXT is produced after cardiac cryoinjury in zebrafish, and that it elicits significant epicardial activation promoting heart regeneration. Oxytocin signaling is also critical for proper epicardium development in zebrafish embryos. The above processes are significantly impaired when OXT signaling is inhibited chemically or genetically through RNA interference. RNA sequencing data suggests that the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) pathway is the primary mediator of OXT-induced epicardial activation. Our research reveals for the first time an evolutionary conserved brain-controlled mechanism inducing cellular reprogramming and regeneration of the injured mammalian and zebrafish heart, a finding that could contribute to translational advances for the treatment of cardiac injuries.","The aim of the present study is the modelling of the total haemoglobin mass responses in altitude environment with the dose-response model in elite endurance athletes and comparison different existing approaches in the quantification of hypoxic dose.","","Background Diarrhea is distinguished by prevalence of bowel movement accompanied by a loose consistency of stools, resulting from hyper peristalsis of the small intestine or colon, Diarrhea is a major challenge among infants and growing children. The study was carried out to assess the result of combined treatment of vitamin C and loperamide on intestinal Na+, K+ - ATPase, alkaline phosphatase, and lipid peroxidation in castor oil induced diarrheal wistar rats.","A characteristic feature of malignant cells, including colorectal cancer cells, is a profound decrease in level of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, product of 5-methylcytosine oxidation by TET enzymes. This study included four groups of subjects: healthy controls, and patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), benign polyps and colorectal cancer. Patients from all groups presented with significantly lower levels of 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine than the controls. A similar tendency was also observed for 5-hydroxymethyluracil level. Patients with IBD showed the highest levels of 5-formylcytosine and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2\u2019-deoxyguanosine of all study subjects, and individuals with colorectal cancer presented with the lowest concentrations of vitamin C and A. Expressions of TET1 and TET2 turned out to be the highest in IBD group. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show that healthy subjects, individuals with precancerous conditions and colorectal cancerpatients present with distinct specific patterns of epigenetic modifications in leukocyte DNA.","","High fat diet intake or statin therapy are known to increase the expression of PCSK9, a key factor involved in the lipid metabolism. Inhibition of PCSK9 is a potential novel strategy for treatment of CVD. Aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of PQQ and atorvastatin on PCSK9 expression in high fat, 10% fructose diet (HFFD) fed rats. Rats received HFFD for 10 weeks followed by treatment of 5 weeks with ATS 10 or 20 mg/kg, PQQ 10 or 20 mg/kg, p.o. per se or in combinations. The effect of the treatments on serum lipid profile, transaminases and PCSK9 concentrations was estimated. Hepatic expressions of PCSK9 and LDLR were quantified by real time quantitative Polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blotting analysis. Compared with the positive control, rats receiving PQQ and ATS showed significant decrease in serum levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL, VLDL, non-HDL and atherogenic index. Further, drug treatment resulted in decreased serum ALT and AST levels (P &lt; 0.0001). PQQ in combination with atorvastatin reduced serum PCSK9 levels (P &lt; 0.0001) while downregulating the hepatic expression of PCSK9 (P &lt; 0.0001) and increasing the expression of LDL-R (P &lt; 0.001) and rescuing its degradation. PQQ along with atorvastatin prevented the LDLR degradation that was induced in the HFFD fed rats by decreasing PCSK9 expression. The results support an improvement in cholesterol management by adding PQQ to statin treatment.","","","Sepsis manifests due to the host\u2019s dysregulated immune response to an infection. High dose ascorbic acid (AA) has emerged as a potential treatment of sepsis, yet little is known regarding how ascorbic acid influences the immune system in sepsis, such as monocytes. The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of high dose AA on monocyte polarization and cytokine production in vitro.","","Cultured pluripotent cells accumulate detrimental epigenetic alterations, including DNA methylation changes at imprinted genes known as loss-of-imprinting (LOI). Despite the substantial biomedical relevance of this phenomenon, the molecular cause of this epigenetic instability in pluripotent cells remains unknown. While the occurrence of LOI is generally considered a stochastic phenomenon, here we document a strong genetic determinant that segregates mouse pluripotent cells into epigenetically stable and unstable cell lines. Unstable lines exhibit hypermethylation at Dlk1-Dio3 and select other imprinted loci, which is associated with impaired developmental potential. Stimulation of demethylases by ascorbic acid prevents LOI and can preserve developmental potential. Susceptibility to LOI greatly differs between commonly used mouse strains, which we utilize to map a causal region on chromosome 13 with Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) analysis. Our observations identify a strong genetic determinant of locus-specific epigenetic abnormalities in pluripotent cells and provide a non-invasive way to suppress them. This highlights the importance of considering genetics in conjunction with culture conditions for assuring the quality of pluripotent cells for biomedical applications.","Atrazine is an herbicide and pollutant of great environmental concern that is naturally biodegraded by microbial communities. Paenarthrobacter aurescens TC1 is one of the most studied degraders of this herbicide. Here, we developed a genome scale metabolic model for P. aurescens TC1, iRZ1176, in order to study the atrazine degradation process and mechanism at organism level. Constraint based flux balance analysis and time dependent simulations were used to explore the bacteria\u2019s phenotypic landscape. Simulations led to model based predictions for growth and atrazine degradation efficiency in myriad of media supplemented with different combinations of carbon and nitrogen sources. Simulations aimed at designing media optimized for supporting growth and enhancing degradation, bypassing the need in strain design via genetic modifications. Predictions were tested in vitro and experimental growth and degradation measurements support and validate the reliability of the model. Model simulations have prioritized degradation and growth enhancement effect of various amino acid and co-factors. The model presented here can potentially serve as a predictive tool towards achieving optimal biodegradation efficiencies and for the development of ecologically friendly solutions for pollutant degradation.","","Previous studies have shown the effects of vitamins on the development of the mammary gland. However, the role of niacin in this process has not been reported. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of niacin on mammary gland development in pubertal mice and to use a mouse mammary epithelial cell line to study the underlying mechanism. The results showed that niacin could activate the AKT/mTOR and ERK signaling pathways by the Gi protein-coupled receptor and increase phosphorylation of 4EBP1 to promote the synthesis of cell proliferation markers, leading to the dissociation of the Rb-E2F1 complex in mMECs. In addition, 0.5% niacin promoted mammary duct development, increased the expression of cyclin D1/D3 and PCNA, and activated Akt/mTOR and ERK1/2 in the mammary glands of pubertal mice. These results strongly suggest that niacin stimulates mammary gland development in pubertal mice through the Akt/mTOR and ERK1/2 signaling pathways and that the Gi protein-coupled receptor is essential for this function.","Chemically defined serum-free media is increasingly used as a tool to help standardize experiments by eliminating the potential variability contributed by pooled serum. These media are formulated for the culture and expansion of specific cell types, maintaining cell viability without the need for exogenous animal proteins. Formulated serum-free media could thus help improve viability and reduce variability during sample preparation for flow cytometry, yet a thorough analysis of how such media impact fluorochrome-antibody conjugates has not been performed. In this study, we expose fluorescent antibody-labeled cells or antibody capture beads to white light in the presence of various hematopoietic cell culture media and provide evidence that formulated serum-free media permit rapid light-initiated fluorescent dye degradation in a cell-independent manner. We observed fluorescence signal loss of several dyes, which included fluorescence spillover into adjacent detectors. Finally, photostability of antibody-fluorochrome conjugates in formulated serum-free media is partially restored in the presence of either serum or vitamin C, implicating reactive oxygen species in the observed signal loss. Thus, our data indicate that formulated serum-free media designed to standardize cell culture are not currently optimized for use with fluorochrome-antibody conjugates, and thus extreme caution should be exercised when using these media in cytometric experiments.","Oxidative stress reflects an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant defense systems, and it can be associated with the pathogenesis and progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis, stroke, and Parkinson's disease (PD). The application of antioxidants, which can defend against oxidative stress, is able to detoxify the reactive intermediates and prevent neurodegeneration resulting from excessive ROS production. There are many reports showing that numerous flavonoids, a large group of natural phenolic compounds, can act as antioxidants and the application of flavonoids has beneficial effects in the adult brain. For instance, it is well known that the long-term consumption of the green tea-derived flavonoids catechin and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) can attenuate the onset of PD. Also, flavonoids such as ampelopsin and pinocembrin can inhibit mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal death through the regulation of gene expression of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway. Additionally, it is well established that many flavonoids exhibit anti-apoptosis and anti-inflammatory effects through cellular signaling pathways, such as those involving (ERK), glycogen synthase kinase-3b (GSK-3b), and (Akt), resulting in neuroprotection. In this review article, we have described the oxidative stress involved in PD and explained the therapeutic potential of flavonoids to protect the nigrostriatal DA system, which may be useful to prevent PD. ","Objective: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been proposed as signaling molecules mediating exercise training adaptation, but the ROS source has remained unclear. This study aimed to investigate the requirement for NADPH oxidase (NOX)2-dependent redox changes induced by acute and long-term high-intensity interval training (HIIT) in skeletal muscle in a mouse model lacking functional NOX2 complex due to deficient p47phox (Ncf1) subunit expression (ncf1* mutation).\nMethods: HIIT was investigated after an acute bout of exercise and after a chronic intervention (3x week for 6 weeks) in wildtype (WT) vs. NOX2 activity-deficient (ncf1*) mice. NOX2 activation during HIIT was measured using a genetically-encoded biosensor. Immunoblotting and single-fiber staining were performed to measure classical exercise-training responsive endpoints in skeletal muscle. \nResults: A single bout of HIIT increased NOX2 activity measured using electroporated p47roGFP oxidation immediately after exercise but not 1h after exercise. After a 6-week of HIIT regime, improvements in maximal running capacity and some muscle training-markers responded less to HIIT in the ncf1* mice compared to WT, including superoxide dismutase (SOD)2, catalase, hexokinase II (HK II), pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and protein markers of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation complexes. Strikingly, HIIT-training increased mitochondrial network area and decreased fragmentation in WT mice only.\nConclusion: This study provided evidence that HIIT exercise activates NOX2 complex in skeletal muscle and that the presence of functional NOX2 is required for specific skeletal muscle adaptations to HIIT relating to antioxidant defense, glucose metabolism, and mitochondria.","Extrachromosomal DNA plays an important role in oncogene amplification in tumour cells and poor outcomes across multiple cancers. However, the function of extrachromosomal DNA in gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA) is very limited. Here, we investigated the availability and function of extrachromosomal DNA in GCA from a Chinese cohort of GCA using whole-genome sequencing (WGS), whole-exome sequencing (WES), and immunohistochemistry. For the first time, we identified the ecDNA amplicons present in most GCA patients, and found that some oncogenes are present as ecDNA amplicons in these patients. We found that oncogene ecDNA amplicons in the GCA cohort were associated with the chromothripsis process and may be induced by accumulated DNA damage due to local dietary habits in the geographic region. Strikingly, we observed diverse correlations between the presence of ecDNA oncogene amplicons and prognosis, where ERBB2 ecDNA amplicons correlated with good prognosis, EGFR ecDNA amplicons correlated with poor prognosis, and CCNE1 ecDNA amplicons did not correlate with prognosis. Large-scale ERBB2 immunohistochemistry results from 1668 GCA patients revealed that there was a positive correlation between the presence of ERBB2 and prognosis in 2-7-year survival; however, there was a negative correlation between the presence of ERBB2 and prognosis in 0-2-year survival. Our observations indicate that the presence of ERBB2 ecDNA in GCA patients may represent a good prognosis marker.","Differentiation of stem cells into functional replacement cells and tissues is a major goal of the regenerative medicine field. However, one limitation has been organization of differentiated cells into multi-cellular, three-dimensional assemblies. The islets of Langerhans contain many endocrine and non-endocrine cell types, such as insulin-producing \u03b2 cells and endothelial cells. Transplantation of exogenous islets into diabetic patients can serve as a cell replacement therapy, replacing the need for patients to inject themselves with insulin, but the number of available islets from cadaveric donors is low. We have developed a strategy of assembling human embryonic stem cell-derived \u03b2 cells with endothelial cells into three-dimensional aggregates on a hydrogel. The resulting islet organoids express \u03b2 cell markers and are functional, capable of undergoing glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. These results provide a platform for evaluating the effects of the islet tissue microenvironment on human embryonic stem cell-derived \u03b2 cells and other islet endocrine cells to develop tissue engineered islets.","Standard cell culture practices require addition of animal-derived serum to culture media to achieve adequate cell growth. Typically, 5-10% by volume of fetal bovine serum (FBS) is used, which accounts for a vast majority of the cost of media while also imposing environmental and ethical concerns associated with the use of animal serum. Here we tested the efficacy of culturing cells by replacing serum in the media with algae extract and select additives. Using LC-MS, we compared molecular signatures of FBS to Chlorella algae extracts and identified NAD(H)/NADP(H) as common and relatively abundant features in their characteristic profiles. Bovine fibroblasts, cultured in serum-free media supplemented with C. vulgaris extract and just two growth factors plus insulin, showed significant growth with enhanced viability compared to control cells cultured without serum, albeit still lower than that of controls cultured with 10% FBS. Moreover, C. vulgaris extract enhanced cell viability beyond that of cells cultured with the two growth factors and insulin alone. These results suggest that key components in serum which are essential for cell growth may also be present in C. vulgaris extract, demonstrating that it may be used at least as a partial alternative to serum for cell culture applications.","Midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons are associated with locomotor and psychiatric disorders. DA subtype is specified in ancestral neural precursor cells (NPCs) and maintained throughout neuronal differentiation. Here we show that endogenous expression of MeCP2 coincides with DA subtype specification in mouse mesencephalon, and premature expression of MeCP2 prevents in vitro cultured NPCs from acquiring DA subtype through interfering NURR1 transactivation of DA phenotype genes. By contrast, MeCP2 overexpression does not disturb DA subtype in DA neurons. By analyzing the dynamic change of DNA methylation along DA neuronal differentiation at the promoter of DA phenotype gene tyrosine hydroxylase (Th), we show that Th expression is determined by TET1-mediated de-methylation of NURR1 binding sites within Th promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that MeCP2 dominates the DNA binding of the corresponding sites thereby blocking TET1 function in DA NPCs, whereas TET1-mediated de-methylation prevents excessive MeCP2 binding in DA neurons. The significance of temporal DNA methylation status is further confirmed by targeted methylation/demethylation experiments showing that targeted de-methylation in DA NPCs protects DA subtype specification from MeCP2 overexpression, whereas targeted methylation disturbs subtype maintenance in MeCP2-overexpressed DA neurons. These findings suggest the appropriate timing of MeCP2 expression as a novel determining factor for guiding NPCs into DA lineage.","Preeclampsia (PE), a leading cause of maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity, is characterized by an increase in S-nitrosylated (SNO) proteins and reactive oxygen species (ROS), suggesting a pathophysiologic role for dysregulation in nitrosylation and nitrosative stress. Here we show that mice lacking S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR\u2212/\u2212), a denitrosylase regulating protein S-nitrosylation, exhibit a PE phenotype, including hypertension, proteinuria, renal pathology, cardiac concentric hypertrophy, decreased placental vascularization, and fetal growth retardation. ROS, nitric oxide (NO) and peroxynitrite levels are elevated. Importantly, mass spectrometry reveals elevated placental SNO-amino acid residues in GSNOR\u2212/\u2212 mice. Ascorbate reverses the phenotype except for fetal weight, reduces the difference in the S-nitrosoproteome, and identifies a unique set of SNO-proteins in GSNOR\u2212/\u2212 mice. Therefore, deficiency of GSNOR creates dysregulation of placental S-nitrosylation and preeclampsia in mice, which can be rescued by ascorbate. These findings offer valuable insights and therapeutic implications for PE.","","Background Particulate matter (PM) pollutant exposure, which induces oxidative stress and inflammation, and vitamin D insufficiency, which compromises immune regulation, are detrimental in asthma.","Lemon (Citrus limon (L.) Burm. f.) is an evergreen tree belonging to the genus Citrus. The fruits are particularly prized for their organoleptic and nutraceutical properties of the juice.","CDK5 belongs to the cycling dependent kinase family, which is multifunctional and plays an important role in neural differentiation. However, the role of CDK5 in osteoblastic differentiation remains unclear. The present study investigated functions and molecular mechanism of CDK5 in osteoblastic differentiation. It was found that, the addition of CDK5 inhibitor Seliciclib promoted the expression of Runx2, ALP, OCN and OPN of MSCs and the mineralization of MC-3T3E1 cells. Seliciclib enhanced the development of F-actin, nuclear localization of \u03b2-catenin and YAP, as well as the expression of RMRP RNA. When F-actin was suppressed by Blebbistatin, the nuclear localization of YAP and \u03b2-catenin, and expression of RMRP RNA as well as Runx2 and ALP were decreased. These indicate Seliciclib promotes osteoblastic differentiation mainly by F-actin. Moreover, Seliciclib also suppressed the migration of MG-63, suggesting a potential application for Seliciclib in bone defect repair and inhibition of the migratiion of osteosarcoma cells.","Nineteenth century medical understanding of human metabolism was limited, therefore, the incidence of metabolic deficiencies was not fully recorded. In addition, the transition from agricultural based mode of life to the industrial one significantly changed the pattern of these metabolic deficiencies. They were further altered by colonisation of distant continents. Palaeopathological study of skeletal remains from the early industrialised colonial era allowed light to be shed on the metabolic stresses produced by this new mode of life. Aims of this study were to investigate manifestations of disease in skeletal remains from 65 (20 adults, 45 sub-adults) migrant settlers buried in the \u201cfree ground\u201d of St Mary\u2019s Anglican Church Cemetery (1847 to 1927). An area allocated for burials paid for by the South Australian Government. Skeletal manifestations were determined and interpreted in terms of their multiple aetiologies. Findings were compared with those published for two 19th century British samples. Skeletal manifestations, commonly related to metabolic deficiencies, were observed. Areas of abnormal porosity of bone cortices were seen in 9 adults and 12 sub-adults, flaring of metaphyses was seen in one sub-adult, flaring of costochondral junctions of the ribs was seen in one sub-adult. Porous lesions of orbital roof bones (Types 3 to 5) were seen on three sub-adults. Micro-CT scans of tooth samples located interglobular dentine in three individuals. Comparison of St Mary\u2019s findings with St Martins, Birmingham, and St Peter\u2019s, Wolverhampton, UK, showed more individuals from St Mary\u2019s had areas of abnormal porosity of bone cortices possibly related to vitamin C deficiency. However, St Mary\u2019s sample displayed fewer changes attributable to vitamin D deficiency as expected in a country with greater UV irradiation. This indicates that, although the early industrialisation produced metabolic stresses, change of the environment through colonisation of new continents altered the distribution of metabolic deficiencies.","Insulin-producing human embryonic stem cell-derived \u03b2 (SC-\u03b2) cells are a promising cell source for diabetes cell replacement therapy. We have recently reported a differentiation strategy that produces SC-\u03b2 cells in islet organoids that not only undergo glucose-stimulated insulin secretion but also have an islet-like dynamic insulin release profile, displaying both first and second phase insulin secretion. The goal of this study was to further characterize the functional profile of these SC-\u03b2 cells in vitro. We utilized a Seahorse extracellular flux analyzer to measure mitochondrial respiration of SC-\u03b2 cells at low and high glucose. We also used photolithography to fabricate a microfluidic device containing microwells to immobilize SC-\u03b2 cells for perfusional analysis, monitoring cytoplasmic calcium using Fluo-4 AM at low and high glucose. Here we find that in addition to increased insulin secretion, SC-\u03b2 cells have increased cellular respiration and cytoplasmic calcium ion concentration in response to a high glucose stimulation. Our results indicate that SC-\u03b2 cells have similar function to that reported for islets, providing further performance characterization that could help with eventual development for diabetes cell therapy and drug screening.","Novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a severe respiratory infection leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS] accounting for thousands of cases and deaths across the world. Several alternatives in treatment options have been assessed and used in this patient population. However, when mechanical ventilation and prone positioning are unsuccessful, venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [VV-ECMO] may be used. We present a case of a 62-year-old female, diabetic, admitted to the intensive care unit with fever, flu-like symptoms and a positive COVID-19 test. Ultimately, she worsened on mechanical ventilation and prone positioning and required VV-ECMO. The use of VV-ECMO in COVID-19 infected patients is still controversial. While some studies have shown a high mortality rate despite aggressive treatment, such as in our case, the lack of large sample size studies and treatment alternatives places healthcare providers against a wall without options in patients with severe refractory ARDS due to COVID-19. ","Leptin is a body weight regulatory hormone, but it is arguably even more potent at regulating blood glucose levels. To further our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which leptin controls glucose homeostasis, we have used transgenic zebrafish models and conditional deletion of beta catenin in the mediobasal hypothalamus of adult mice to show that Wnt signalling in the brain mediates glucoregulatory effects of leptin. In zebrafish, under normal feeding conditions, leptin regulates glucose homeostasis but not adipostasis. In times of nutrient excess, we found that leptin also regulates body weight and size in this species. Using a Wnt signalling reporter fish, we show that leptin directly activates the canonical Wnt pathway in vivo. Pharmacological inhibition of this pathway prevented the leptin-induced improvement in glucose tolerance. In adult mice, conditional deletion of the key Wnt effector molecule, \u03b2-catenin, in the mediobasal hypothalamus of male mice confirmed the essential role of the Wnt pathway in mediating leptin action and the neuroendocrine regulation of glucose homeostasis. Adult-onset \u03b2-catenin deletion in the mediobasal hypothalamus led to glucose intolerance, exacerbation of caloric intake and body weight gain under high fat diet, as well as resistance to exogenous leptin.","","DNA methylation is essential for heterochromatin formation and repression of DNA repeat transcription, both of which are essential for genome integrity. Loss of DNA methylation is associated with disease, including cancer, but is also required for development. Alternative pathways to maintain heterochromatin are thus needed to limit DNA damage accumulation. Here, we find that DAXX, an H3.3 chaperone, protects pericentromeric heterochromatin and is essential for embryonic stem cells (ESCs) maintenance in the ground-state of pluripotency. Upon DNA demethylation-mediated damage, DAXX relocalizes to pericentromeric regions, and recruits PML and SETDB1, thereby promoting heterochromatin formation. In the absence of DAXX, the 3D-architecture and physical properties of pericentric heterochromatin are disrupted, resulting in derepression of major satellite DNA. Using epigenome editing tools, we demonstrate that H3.3, and specifically H3.3K9 modification, directly contribute to maintaining pericentromeric chromatin conformation. Altogether, our data reveal that DAXX and H3.3 unite DNA damage response and heterochromatin maintenance in ESCs.","","The Kr\u00fcppel-associated box zinc finger protein (KRAB-ZFP) family amplified and diversified in mammals by segmental duplications, but the function of the majority of this gene family remains largely unexplored due to the inaccessibility of the gene clusters to conventional gene targeting. We determined the genomic binding sites of 61 murine KRAB-ZFPs and genetically deleted in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells five large KRAB-ZFP gene clusters encoding nearly one tenth of the more than 700 mouse KRAB-ZFPs. We demonstrate that clustered KRAB-ZFPs directly bind and silence retrotransposons and block retrotransposon-borne enhancers from gene activation in ES cells. Homozygous knockout mice generated from ES cells deleted in one of two KRAB-ZFP clusters were born at sub-mendelian frequencies in some matings, but heterozygous intercrosses could also yield knockout progeny with no overt phenotype. We further developed a retrotransposon capture-sequencing approach to assess mobility of the MMETn family of endogenous retrovirus like elements, which are transcriptionally activated in KRAB-ZFP cluster KOs, in a pedigree of KRAB-ZFP cluster KO and WT mice. We identified numerous somatic and several germ-line MMETn insertions, and found a modest increase in activity in mutant animals, but these events were detected in both wild-type and KO mice in stochastic and highly variable patterns. Our data suggests that the majority of young KRAB-ZFPs play a non-essential role in transposon silencing, likely due to the large redundancy with other KRAB-ZFPs and other transposon restriction pathways in mice.","Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are still waiting for curative treatments. Considering the environmental cause of COPD (e.g., cigarette smoke) and disease phenotypes, including stem-cell senescence and impaired differentiation, we hypothesized that COPD will be associated with altered epigenetic signaling in lung cells. We generated genome-wide DNA methylation maps at single CpG resolution of primary human lung fibroblasts (HLFs) isolated from distal parenchyma of ex-smoker controls and COPD patients, with both mild and severe disease. The epigenetic landscape is markedly changed in lung fibroblasts across COPD stages, with DNA methylation changes occurring predominantly in regulatory regions, including promoters and enhancers. RNA sequencing of matched fibroblasts demonstrated dysregulation of genes involved in proliferation, DNA repair, and extracellular matrix organization. Notably, we identified epigenetic and transcriptional dysregulation already in mild COPD patients, providing unique insights into early disease. Integration of profiling data identified 110 candidate regulators of disease phenotypes, including epigenetic factors. Using phenotypic screens, we verified the regulator capacity of multiple candidates and linked them to repair processes in the human lung.","Objectives Maternal nutrition plays a crucial role in influencing fetal growth and birth outcomes. The government of Indonesia has provided a manufactured fortified food supplementation program for undernourished pregnant mothers. We hypothesized a low-cost local food supplementation (LFS) would improve maternal and birth outcomes compared with government food supplementation (GFS).","Around 60% of in vitro fertilized (IVF) human embryos irreversibly arrest before compaction between the 3-8-cell stage, posing a significant clinical problem. The mechanisms behind this arrest are unclear. Here, we show that the arrested embryos enter a quiescent-like state, marked by cell cycle arrest, the downregulation of ribosomes and histones and downregulation of MYC and p53 activity. Mechanistically, the arrested embryos can be divided into three types. Type I embryos fail to complete the maternal-zygotic transition, and type II/III embryos have erroneously low levels of glycolysis and variable levels of oxidative phosphorylation. Treatment with resveratrol or nicotinamide riboside (NR) can partially rescue the arrested phenotype. The mechanism of reactivation involves the upregulation of SIRT1, and activation of glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation which forces the embryos out of a quiescent state. Overall, our data reveal how human embryo arrest can be overcome by modulating metabolic pathways.","Induced pluripotent stem cell reprogramming is inherently inefficient and understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying this inefficiency holds the key to successfully control cellular identity. Here, we report 16 novel reprogramming roadblock genes identified by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome-wide knockout (KO) screening. Of these, depletion of the predicted KRAB zinc finger protein (KRAB-ZFP) Zfp266 strongly and consistently enhanced iPSC generation in several iPSC reprogramming settings, emerging as the most robust roadblock. Further analyses revealed that ZFP266 binds Short Interspersed Nuclear Elements (SINEs) adjacent to binding sites of pioneering factors, OCT4 (POU5F1), SOX2 and KLF4, and impedes chromatin opening. Replacing the KRAB co-suppressor with a co-activator domain converted ZFP266 from a reprogramming inhibitor to a potent reprogramming facilitator. This work proposes SINE-KRAB-ZFP interaction to be a critical regulator of chromatin accessibility at enhancers for efficient cellular identity changes and also serves as a resource to further illuminate molecular mechanisms hindering reprogramming.","Citrus is a valuable crop in Pakistan because it is rich in vitamin C and antioxidants. Huanglongbing (HLB) has an influence on citrus production around the world caused by a bacterium \u201cCandidatus liberibacter asiaticus\u201d (CLas), africanus and americanus. The structure and diversity of bacterial species in various ecosystems can be quickly examined using NGS. This approach is considerably quicker and more precise than outdated methods. Healthy or citrus greening infected leaf samples of Grapefruit, Citrus aurantifolia, and Citrus reticulata Blanco was used for diversity analysis. In this study high throughput, NGS technique was used to access the population of both cultivable and non-cultivable bacterial endophytes from citrus leaves, by using PCR amplicons of 16S rDNA sequences (V5\u2013V7 regions) with Illumina Hi seq. As a result, a total number of 68,722 sequences were produced from the test samples. According to the NGS-based diversity classification, the most common genera of exploited bacterial endophytes were Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroides, Cyanobacteria, and Actinobacteria. Citrus aurantifolia and Citrus paradisi showed almost equal diversity, whereas Citrus reticulata Blanco had a higher proportion of Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria in their leaves. To determine alpha diversity (AD), additional data was analyzed using statistical indices such as Shannon, Chao1, and Simpson. According to the inverse Simpson diversity index, the abundance of the microbial population in six different citrus samples was 0.48, 0.567, and 0.163, respectively. The metagenomics of microbiota in plant tissues was successfully recorded by NGS technology, which can help us learn more about the interactions between plants and microbes. This research is the first step toward a better understanding of 16SrRNA-based metagenomics from citrus in Pakistan using Illumina (Hi seq) Technology.","Pesticide exposure is associated with cognitive and psychomotor disorders. Glyphosate-based herbicides (GlyBH) are among the most used agrochemicals, and inhalation of GlyBH sprays may arise from frequent aerial pulverizations. Previously, we described that intranasal (IN) administration of GlyBH in mice decreases locomotor activity, increases anxiety, and impairs recognition memory. Then, the aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanisms involved in GlyBH neurotoxicity after IN administration. Adult male CF-1 mice were exposed to GlyBH IN administration (equivalent to 50 mg/kg/day of Gly acid, 3 days a week, during 4 weeks). Total thiol content and the activity of the enzymes catalase, acetylcholinesterase and transaminases were evaluated in different brain areas. In addition, markers of the cholinergic and the nigrostriatal pathways, as well as of astrocytes were evaluated by fluorescence microscopy in coronal brain sections. The brain areas chosen for analysis were those seen to be affected in our previous study. GlyBH IN administration impaired the redox balance of the brain and modified the activities of enzymes involved in cholinergic and glutamatergic pathways. Moreover, GlyBH treatment decreased the number of cholinergic neurons in the medial septum as well as the expression of the \u03b17-acetylcholine receptor in the hippocampus. Also, the number of astrocytes increased in the anterior olfactory nucleus of the exposed mice. Taken together, these disturbances may contribute to the neurobehavioural impairments reported previously by us after IN GlyBH administration in mice.","The brain has a remarkable capacity to acquire and store memories that can later be selectively recalled. These processes are supported by the hippocampus which is thought to index memory recall by reinstating information stored across distributed neocortical circuits. However, the mechanism that supports this interaction remains unclear. Here, in humans, we show that recall of a visual cue from a paired associate is accompanied by a transient increase in the ratio between glutamate and GABA in visual cortex. Moreover, these excitatory-inhibitory fluctuations are predicted by activity in the hippocampus. These data suggest the hippocampus gates memory recall by indexing information stored across neocortical circuits using a disinhibitory mechanism.","Rationale Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by repetitive behaviors exacerbated by stress. Many OCD patients do not respond to available pharmacotherapies, but neurosurgical ablation of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) can provide symptomatic relief. Although the ACC receives noradrenergic innervation and expresses adrenergic receptors (ARs), the involvement of norepinephrine (NE) in OCD has not been investigated.","Background Small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (SQ-LNS) have been shown to reduce the prevalence of anemia and iron deficiency among infants and young children, but effects on other micronutrients are less well known. Identifying subgroups who may experience greater benefits from SQ-LNS, or who are more likely to respond to the intervention, may facilitate the development of public health policies and programs.","","","","Soft bioelectronic interfaces for mapping and modulating excitable networks at high resolution and at large scale can enable paradigm-shifting diagnostics, monitoring, and treatment strategies. Yet, current technologies largely rely on materials and fabrication schemes that are expensive, do not scale, and critically limit the maximum attainable resolution and coverage. Solution processing is a cost-effective manufacturing alternative, but biocompatible conductive inks matching the performance of conventional metals are lacking. Here, we introduce MXtrodes, a novel class of soft, high-resolution, large-scale bioelectronic interfaces enabled by Ti3C2 MXene and scalable solution processing. We show that the electrochemical properties of MXtrodes exceed those of conventional materials, and do not require conductive gels when used in epidermal electronics. Furthermore, we validate MXtrodes in a number of applications ranging from mapping large scale neuromuscular networks in humans to delivering cortical microstimulation in small animal models. Finally, we demonstrate that MXtrodes are compatible with standard clinical neuroimaging modalities.","Differentiated cell nuclei can be reprogrammed after nuclear transfer (NT) to oocytes and the produced NT embryos can give rise to cloned animals. However, development of NT embryos is often hampered by recurrent reprogramming failures, including the incomplete activation of developmental genes, yet specific genes responsible for the arrest of NT embryos are not well understood. Here, we searched for developmentally important genes among the reprogramming-resistant H3K9me3-repressed genes, and identified Alyref and Gabpb1 by siRNA screening. Gene knockout of Alyref and Gabpb1 by the CRISPR/Cas9 system resulted in early developmental arrest in mice. Single embryo RNA-seq revealed that Alyref is needed for the formation of inner cell mass. The supplement of Alyref and Gabpb1 by mRNA injection supported efficient preimplantation development of cloned embryos. Thus, our study shows that the H3K9me3-repressed genes contain developmentally required genes and the incomplete activation of such genes results in preimplantation arrest of cloned embryos.","Soil microorganisms drive ecosystem function, but challenges of scale between microbe and ecosystem hinder our ability to accurately quantify and predictively model the soil microbe-ecosystem function relationship. Quantifying this relationship necessitates studies that systematically characterize multi-omics of soil microorganisms and their activity across sampling scales from spatially resolved to bulk measures, and structural complexity, from liquid pure culture to in situ. To address this need, we cultured two diazotrophic bacteria in liquid and solid media, with and without nitrogen (N) to quantify differences in extracellular metabolites associated with nitrogen fixation under increasing environmental structural complexity. We also quantified extracellular metabolites across sampling scales including bulk sampling via GC-MS analysis and spatially resolved analysis via MALDI mass spectrometry imaging. We found extracellular production of inorganic and organic N during free-living nitrogen fixation activity, highlighting a key mechanism of terrestrial N contributions from this process. Additionally, our results emphasize the need to consider the structural complexity of the environment and spatial scale when quantifying microbial activity. We found differences in metabolite profiles between culture conditions, supporting previous work indicating environmental structure influences microbial function, and across scales, underscoring the need to quantify microbial scale conditions to accurately interpret microbial function.","Coatomer complexes function in the sorting and trafficking of proteins between subcellular organelles. Pathogenic variants in coatomer subunits or associated factors have been reported in multi-systemic disorders, i.e., coatopathies, that can affect the skeletal and central nervous systems. We have identified loss-of-function variants in COPB2, a component of the coatomer complex I (COPI), in individuals presenting with osteoporosis, fractures and developmental delay of variable severity. Because the role of COPB2 in bone has not been characterized, we studied the effect of COPB2 deficiency on skeletal development in mice and zebrafish. Copb2+/\u2212 mice showed low bone mass and decreased bone strength. In zebrafish, larvae carrying a copb2 heterozygous frameshift variant showed delayed mineralization. copb2-null embryos showed endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi disorganization, and embryonic lethality. COPB2 siRNA-treated fibroblasts showed delayed collagen trafficking with retention of type I collagen in the ER and Golgi, and altered distribution of Golgi markers. Our data suggest that COPB2 haploinsufficiency leads to disruption of intracellular collagen trafficking and osteoporosis, which may improve with ascorbic acid supplementation. This work highlights the role of COPI complex as a critical regulator of bone mass and identifies a new form of coatopathy due to COPB2 deficiency.","Methylation of histone 3 at lysine 9 (H3K9) is widely regarded as a major roadblock for cellular reprogramming and interference with associated methyltransferases such as EHMT1 and EHMT2 (also known as GLP and G9A, respectively) increases the efficiencies at which induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be derived. Activation of histone and DNA demethylases by ascorbic acid (AA) has become a common approach to facilitate the extensive epigenetic remodeling required for iPSC formation, but possible functional interactions between the H3K9 methylation machinery and AA-stimulated enzymes remain insufficiently explored. Here we show that reduction of EHMT1/2 activity counteracts iPSC formation in an optimized reprogramming system in the presence of AA. Mechanistically, EHMT1/2 activity under these conditions is required for efficient downregulation of somatic genes and transition into an epithelial state. Of note, transient inhibition of EHMT1/2 during reprogramming yields iPSCs that fail to efficiently give rise to viable mice, suggesting persistent molecular defects in these cells. Genetic interference with the H3K9 demethylase KDM3B ameliorated the adverse effect of EHMT1/2 inhibition on iPSC formation. Together, our observations document novel functions of H3K9 methyltransferases during iPSC formation and suggest that the balancing of AA-stimulated enzymes by EHMT1/2 supports efficient and error-free iPSC reprogramming to pluripotency.","Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replicates in CD4+ T cells leading to profound T cell loss, immunological dysfunction and AIDS. Determining how HIV-1 shapes the immunological niche in which it resides to create a permissive environment is central to informing efforts to limit pathogenesis, disturb viral reservoirs and achieve a cure. A key roadblock in understanding HIV-T cell interactions is the requirement to activate CD4+ T cells in vitro in order to make them permissive to infection. This dramatically alters T cell biology, obscuring native virus-host interactions. Here we show that HIV-1 cell-to-cell spread permits efficient and productive infection of resting CD4+ T cells without the need for prior activation. Infection is preferential for resting memory T cells, is observed with both CXCR4-tropic virus and CCR5-tropic transmitter-founder viruses and results in virus production and onward spreading infection. Strikingly, we find that HIV-1 infection of resting memory CD4+ T cells primes for induction of a tissue-resident memory (TRM)-like phenotype evidenced by upregulation of TRM markers CD69/CXCR6 alongside co-expression of CD49a, PD-1, CD101 as well as transcription factor Blimp-1. Furthermore, we reveal that HIV-1 initiates a transcriptional program that overlaps with the core TRM transcriptional signature. This reprograming depends on the HIV-1 accessory protein Vpr. We propose that HIV-1 infection drives a CD4+ TRM-phenotype potentially sequestering infected cells within tissues to support viral replication and persistence.","Background Obesity has been identified as an emerging health concern for Chinese American children; however, very little is known about diets in Asian American children.","Striatal medium spiny neurons are highly susceptible in Huntington\u2019s disease (HD), resulting in progressive synaptic perturbations that lead to neuronal dysfunction and death. Non-invasive imaging techniques, such as proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS), are used in HD mouse models and patients with HD to monitor neurochemical changes associated with neuronal health. However, the association between brain neurochemical alterations and synaptic dysregulation is unknown, limiting our ability to monitor potential treatments that may affect synapse function. We conducted in vivo longitudinal 1H-MRS in the striatum followed by ex-vivo analyses of excitatory synapse density of two synaptic circuits disrupted in HD, thalamo-striatal (T-S) and cortico-striatal (C-S) pathways, to assess the relationship between neurochemical alterations and changes in synapse density. We used the zQ175(Tg/0) HD mouse model as well as zQ175 mice lacking one allele of CK2\u03b1\u2019(zQ175(Tg/0):CK2\u03b1\u2019(+/\u2212)), a kinase previously shown to regulate synapse function in HD. Longitudinal analyses of excitatory synapse density showed early and sustained reduction in T-S synapses in zQ175 mice, preceding C-S synapse depletion, which was rescued in zQ175:CK2\u03b1\u2019(+/\u2212). Changes in T-S and C-S synapses were accompanied by progressive alterations in numerous neurochemicals between WT and HD mice. Linear regression analyses showed C-S synapse number positively correlated with 1H-MRS-measured levels of GABA while T-S synapse number positively correlated with levels of alanine, phosphoethanolamine and lactate, and negatively correlated with total creatine levels.","","Oxidative stress is a potential cost of social dominance and reproduction, which could mediate life history trade-offs between current and future reproductive fitness. However, the evidence for an oxidative cost of social dominance and reproduction is mixed, in part because organisms have efficient protective mechanisms that can counteract oxidative insults. Further, previous studies have shown that different aspects of oxidative balance, including oxidative damage and antioxidant function, varies dramatically between tissue types, yet few studies have investigated oxidative cost in terms of interconnectedness and coordination within the system. Here, we tested whether dominant and subordinate males of the cichlid Astatotilapa burtoni differ in integration of different components of oxidative stress. We assessed 7 markers of oxidative stress, which included both oxidative damage and antioxidant function in various tissue types (total of 14 measurements). Across all oxidative stress measurements, we found more co-regulated clusters in dominant males, suggesting that components of oxidative state are more functionally integrated in dominant males than they are in subordinate males. We discuss how a high degree of functional integration reflects increased robustness or efficiency of the system (e.g. increased effectiveness of antioxidant machinery in reducing oxidative damage), but we also highlight potential costs (e.g. activation of cytoprotective mechanisms may have unwanted pleiotropic effects). Overall, our results suggest that quantifying the extent of functional integration across different components of oxidative stress could reveal insights into the oxidative cost of important life history events.","","Transplantation of pancreatic islet cells derived from human pluripotent stem cells is a promising treatment for diabetes. Despite progress in stem cell-derived islet (SC-islet) generation, detailed characterization of their functional properties has not been conducted. Here, we generated functionally mature SC-islets using an optimized protocol and comprehensively benchmarked them against primary adult islets. Biphasic glucose stimulated insulin secretion developed during in vitro maturation, associated with cytoarchitectural reorganization and increased alpha cells. Electrophysiology and exocytosis of SC-islets were comparable to adult islets. Glucose-responsive insulin secretion was achieved despite differences in glycolytic and mitochondrial glucose metabolism. Single-cell transcriptomics of SC-islets in vitro and throughout 6 months of murine engraftment revealed a continuous maturation trajectory culminating in a transcriptional landscape closely resembling that of primary islets. Our thorough evaluation of SC-islet maturation highlights their advanced degree of functionality and supports their use in further efforts to understand and combat diabetes.","Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a complex inflammatory and debilitating skin disease for which no effective treatment is available. This is partly because of the unavailability of suitable human or animal models with which exact pathobiology of the disease can be defined. Here, we describe the development of air-liquid (A-L) interface, liquid-liquid/liquid-submersion (L-S) and bioreactor (Bio) ex vivo skin culture models. All three ex vivo platforms were effective for culturing skin samples up to day-14, with the tissue architecture and integrity remaining intact for at least 3 days for healthy skin while for 14 days for HS skin. Up to day-3, no significant differences were observed in % early apoptotic cells among all three platforms. However, an increase was observed in late apoptotic/necrotic cells in HS skin at day-3 in A-L and Bio culture of HS skin. These cultures efficiently support the growth of various cells populations, including keratinocytes and immune cells. Profiling of the inflammatory genes using HS skin from these ex vivo cultures showed dynamic expression changes at day-3 and day-14. All of these cultures are necessary to represent the inflammatory gene status of HS skin at day-0 suggesting that not all gene clusters are identically altered in each culture method. Similarly, cytokine/chemokine profiling of the supernatant from vehicle- and drug-treated ex vivo HS cultures again showed better prediction of drug efficacy against HS. Overall, development of these three systems collectively provide a powerful tool to uncover the pathobiology of HS progression and screen various drugs against HS.","Differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into insulin-producing stem cell-derived beta cells harbors great potential for research and therapy of diabetes. The SOX9 gene plays a crucial role during development of the pancreas and particularly in the development of insulin-producing cells as SOX9+ cells form the source for NEUROG3+ endocrine progenitor cells. For the purpose of easy monitoring of differentiation efficiencies into pancreatic progenitors and insulin-producing cells, we generated new reporter lines by knocking in a P2A-H-2Kk-F2A-GFP2 reporter genes into the SOX9 locus and a P2A-mCherry reporter gene into the INS locus mediated by CRISPR/CAS9-technology. The knock-ins enable co-expression of the endogenous genes and reporter genes, report the endogenous gene expression and enable the purification of pancreatic progenitors and insulin-producing cells using FACS or MACS. Using these cell lines we established a new differentiation protocol geared towards SOX9+ cells to efficiently drive human pluripotent stem cells into glucose-responsive beta cells.","Recent studies have indicated that consumption of amino acid-rich compounds can increase tendon collagen content and enhance biomechanical function. Still, it is not clear as to what extent oral consumption of amino acids alters peritendinous amino acid concentrations. Whether aging alters the delivery of amino acids to tendon tissue after oral consumption is also not known. Using microdialysis, we determined the impact of a single oral essential amino acid bolus on Achilles peritendinous amino acid concentrations in younger (n=7; 27\u00b11 yr.) and older adults (n=6; 68\u00b12 yrs.) over four hours. The peritendinous concentration of all amino acids in the beverage except methionine (p=0.136) and glycine (p=0.087) increased with time (p&lt;0.05). Additionally, the concentrations of glycine and arginine were greater in older adults (p\u22640.05). We also accessed the impact of amino acid consumption on peritendinous concentrations of pro-collagen I\u03b11, a marker of collagen synthesis. Pro-collagen I\u03b11 tended to change with time (p=0.071) but was not altered age (p=0.226). We demonstrate that an oral amino acid bolus leads to modest increases in Achilles peritendinous amino acid concentrations in young and older adults. The concentration of some amino acids was also greater in older adults. However, the amino acid bolus did not significantly impact peritendinous pro-collagen concentrations.","KCNMA1 forms the pore of BK K+ channels, which regulate neuronal and muscle excitability. Recently, genetic screening identified heterozygous KCNMA1 variants in a subset of patients with debilitating paroxysmal non-kinesigenic dyskinesia, presenting with or without epilepsy (PNKD3). However, the relevance of KCNMA1 mutations and the basis for clinical heterogeneity in PNKD3 has not been established. Here we evaluate the relative severity of three KCNMA1 patient variants in BK channels, neurons, and mice. In heterologous cells, BKN999S and BKD434G channels displayed gain-of-function (GOF) properties, whereas BKH444Q channels showed loss-of-function (LOF) properties. The relative degree of channel activity was BKN999S &gt; BKD434G &gt; WT &gt; BKH444Q. BK currents and action potential firing were increased, and seizure thresholds decreased, in Kcnma1N999S/WT and Kcnma1D434G/WT transgenic mice but not Kcnma1H444Q/WT mice. In a novel behavioral test for paroxysmal dyskinesia, the more severely affected Kcnma1N999S/WT mice became immobile after stress, consistent with stress-induced immobility episodes observed in PNKD3-affected individuals. Homozygous Kcnma1D434G/D434G mice showed similar immobility, but in contrast, homozygous Kcnma1H444Q/H444Q mice displayed hyperkinetic behavior. These data establish the relative pathogenic potential of patient alleles as N999S &gt; D434G &gt; H444Q and validate Kcnma1N999S/WT mice as a model for PNKD3 with increased seizure propensity.","Cells of the trophoblast lineage constitute the major part of placental tissues in higher mammals. Recent derivation of human trophoblast stem cells (TSC) from placental cytotrophoblasts (CT) and from human naive PSCs opens new opportunities for studying development and function of human placenta. Several recent reports have suggested that naive human PSCs retain an exclusive potential to give rise to bona fide TSCs. Here we report that inhibition of TGFbeta pathway and avoiding WNT stimulation, leads to direct and robust conversion of primed human pluripotent stem cells into TSCs. Systematic side by side comparative analysis showed that the latter are equivalent to previously derived TSC lines. Primed PSC derived TSC lines exhibit self-renewal, are able to differentiate into the main trophoblast lineages, and present RNA and epigenetic profiles that are indistinguishable from the TSC lines derived from placenta or naive PSCs. Our findings underscore a residual plasticity in primed human PSCs that allows converting directly into pre-implantation extra-embryonic cell lineages.","Nutritional intake impacts the human epigenome by directing epigenetic pathways in normal cell development via as yet unknown molecular mechanisms. Consequently, imbalance in the nutritional intake is able to dysregulate the epigenetic profile and drive cells towards malignant transformation. Herein, we present a novel epigenetic effect of the essential nutrient, NAD. We demonstrate that impairment of DNMT1 enzymatic activity by NAD-promoted ADP-ribosylation, leads to demethylation and transcriptional activation of CEBPA gene, suggesting the existence of an unknown NAD-controlled region within the locus. In addition to the molecular events, NAD treated cells exhibit significant morphological and phenotypical changes that correspond to myeloid differentiation.","Excessive ethanol exposure can cause mitochondrial and cellular toxicity. In order to discover potential counteracting interventions, it is essential to develop assays capable of capturing the consequences of ethanol exposure in human dopaminergic (DA) neurons, which are crucial for the development and maintenance of alcohol use disorders (AUD). Here, we developed a novel high-throughput (HT) assay to quantify mitochondrial and neuronal toxicity in human DA neurons from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). The assay, dubbed mitochondrial neuronal health (MNH) assay, combines live-cell measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) with quantification of neuronal branching complexity post-fixation. Using the MNH assay, we demonstrated that chronic ethanol exposure in human iPSC-derived DA neurons decreases MMP and branching complexity in a dose-dependent manner. The toxic effect of ethanol on DA neurons was already detectable after 1 hour of exposure, and occurred similarly in DA neurons derived from healthy individuals and from patients with AUD. We next used the MNH assay to carry out a proof-of-concept compound screening using FDA-approved drugs. We identified potential candidate drugs modulating acute ethanol toxicity in human DA neurons. Among these drugs, flavoxate and disulfiram influenced mitochondrial neuronal health independently from ethanol, leading to amelioration and worsening, respectively. Altogether, we developed an HT assay to probe human mitochondrial neuronal health and used it to assess ethanol neurotoxicity and to identify modulating agents. The MNH assay represents an effective new tool for discovering modulators of mitochondrial neuronal health and toxicity in live human neurons.","Background Reprogramming of somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and subsequent differentiation into iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iCM) seems to be a promising strategy for cardiac regenerative therapy. However, recent failure or poor outcomes in cardiac cell therapy warrants further investigation focusing on the infarction/wound environment (site of healing) to improve the cardiac regenerative medicine. Here, using next generation sequencing (NGS), we analyzed the global transcriptome to discover the unidentified genes/pathways that are crucial for cell survival, cytoprotection and mitochondrial dynamics during the differentiation of iPSC into iCM.","Eastern Himalayan foothills are known to have optimal agro-climatic conditions for production of quality citrus fruits including oranges. Among the citrus growing regions of eastern Himalayas, Wakro in the far eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh is known for its superior quality oranges, popular as the Wakro orange or the Arunachal orange, which has been included in Geographical Indication Registry by the Government of India. However, during last few years, Arunachal orange orchards have been experiencing severe infestation of aphid associated with rapid decline disease, causing catastrophe to the farmers as well as state economy. Therefore, in 2015, an intensive survey of severely affected orange orchards was carried out to investigate the aetiological factors of citrus decline. RNA samples extracted from leaf and aphid specimens collected from Wakro orchards were subjected to CTV detection through 3\u2019-UTR specific RT-PCR. Subsequently, ORF1 and CP genetic regions were amplified and clonal-sequencing was performed. Although, BLAST search showed close homology of the present sequences with other virulent genotype VT sequences, detailed phylogenetic analysis demonstrated affinity and clustering of present sequences with VT sequences belonging to the \u2018western\u2019 lineage. This finding is considerably distinct from CTV sequences reported from citrus growing orchards in India and other neighbouring countries. Additionally, low diversity of CP gene sequences, recombination patterns and presence of sequence segments identical to the present ones in other CTV genotypes was also revealed. Collectively, these observations indicate pristine and primeval nature of present CTV sequences, corroborating well with the proposed origin of CTV in this part of the globe. We here report our finding of western lineage of CTV virulent genotype VT, which is distinct from CTV molecular epidemiology in other parts of India and discuss the implications of these findings.","Neurocognitive development is a dynamic process over the life course and is influenced by intrauterine factors as well as later life environment. Using data from the Pune Maternal Nutrition Study (PMNS) from 1994 to 2008, we investigate the association of in-utero, birth, and childhood conditions with offspring neurocognitive development in 686 participants of the cohort, at age 12 years. The life course exposure variables in the analysis include maternal pre-pregnancy size and nutrition during pregnancy, offspring birth measurements, nutrition and physical growth at age 12 years along with parental education and socio-economic status. We used the novel Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) approach; which has been shown to have better predictive performance over traditional tests of associations. Our study employs 8 standard neurocognitive tests that measure intelligence, working memory, visuo-conceptual and verbal learning, and decision-making/attention at 12 years of age. We control for nutritional-metabolic information based on blood measurements from the pregnant mothers and the children at 12 years of age. Our findings highlight the critical role of parental education and socioeconomic background in determining child neurocognitive performance. Maternal characteristics (pre-pregnancy BMI, fasting insulin during pregnancy) and child height at 12 years were also robust predictors on the BMA. A range of early factors \u2013 such as maternal folate and ferritin concentrations during pregnancy, and child\u2019s head circumference at birth \u2013 remained important determinants of some dimensions of child\u2019s neurocognitive development, but their associations were not robust once we account for model uncertainty. Our results suggest that intrauterine influences on long term neurocognitive outcomes may be potentially reversible by post birth remediation. In addition to the current nutritional interventions, public health policy should also consider social interventions in children born into families with low socio-economic status to improve human capital.","Genome stability is essential for brain development and function. However, the contribution of DNA repair to genome stability in neurons remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the base excision repair protein Pol\u03b2 is involved in hippocampal neuronal differentiation via a TET-mediated active DNA demethylation during early postnatal stages. Pol\u03b2 deficiency induced extensive DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in hippocampal neurons, and a lesser extent in cortical neurons, during a period in which decreased levels of 5-methylcytosine were observed in genomic DNA. Inhibition of the hydroxylation of 5-methylcytosine by microRNAs miR29a/b-1 expression diminished DSB formation. Conversely, its induction by TET1 overexpression increased DSBs. The damaged hippocampal neurons exhibited aberrant neuronal gene expression profiles and dendrite formation. Behavioral analyses revealed impaired spatial learning and memory in adulthood. Thus, Pol\u03b2 maintains genome stability in the active DNA demethylation that occurs during postnatal neuronal development, thereby contributing to differentiation and subsequent behavior.","Exposure to unfamiliar odorants induces an array of repetitive defensive and non-defensive behaviors in rodents which likely reflect adaptive stress responses to the uncertain valence of novel stimuli. Mice genetically deficient for dopamine \u03b2-hydroxylase (Dbh\u2212/\u2212) lack the enzyme required to convert dopamine (DA) into norepinephrine (NE), resulting in globally undetectable NE and supranormal DA levels. Because catecholamines modulate novelty detection and reactivity, we investigated the effects of novel plant-derived odorants on repetitive behaviors in Dbh\u2212/\u2212 mice and Dbh+/\u2212 littermate controls, which have catecholamine levels comparable to wild-type mice. Unlike Dbh+/\u2212 controls, which exhibited vigorous digging in response to novel odorants, Dbh\u2212/\u2212 mice displayed excessive grooming. Drugs that block NE synthesis or neurotransmission suppressed odorant-induced digging in Dbh+/\u2212 mice, while a DA receptor antagonist attenuated grooming in Dbh\u2212/\u2212 mice. The testing paradigm elicited high circulating levels of corticosterone regardless of Dbh genotype, indicating that NE is dispensable for this systemic stress response. Odorant exposure increased NE and DA abundance in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of Dbh+/\u2212 mice, while Dbh\u2212/\u2212 animals lacked NE and had elevated PFC DA levels that were unaffected by novel smells. Together, these findings suggest that novel odorant-induced increases in central NE tone contribute to repetitive digging and reflect psychological stress, while central DA signaling contributes to repetitive grooming. Further, we have established a simple method for repeated assessment of stress-induced repetitive behaviors in mice, which may be relevant for modeling neuropsychiatric disorders like Tourette syndrome or obsessive-compulsive disorder that are characterized by stress-induced exacerbation of compulsive symptoms.","Objective One-carbon metabolism is a metabolic network that integrates nutritional signals with biosynthesis, redox homeostasis, and epigenetics. There are sex differences in hepatic one-carbon metabolism. However, it is unclear whether there are sex differences in dietary deficiencies of one-carbon metabolism in the brain. The aim of this study was to investigate if sex modulates the effects of dietary folic acid deficiency in brain tissue using a mouse model.","The relationship between vitamin D and reactive oxygen species (ROS), two integral signaling and damaging molecules of the cell, is poorly understood. This is striking, given that both factors are involved in cancer cell regulation and metabolism. Mitochondria (mt) dysfunction is one of the main drivers of cancer, producing higher cellular energy and ROS that can enhance oxidative stress and stress tolerance responses. To study the effects of vitamin D on metabolic and mt dysfunction, we used the vitamin D receptor (VDR)-sensitive MG-63 osteosarcoma cell model. Using biochemical approaches, active vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, 1,25(OH)2D3) decreased mt ROS levels, membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8mt), biogenesis, and translation, while enforcing endoplasmic reticulum/mitohormetic stress tolerance responses. Using a mitochondria-focused transcriptomic approach, gene set enrichment and pathway analyses show that 1,25(OH)2D3 lowered mt fusion/fission and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). By contrast, mitophagy, ROS defense, and epigenetic gene regulation were enhanced after 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment, as well as key metabolic enzymes that regulate fluxes of substrates for cellular architecture and a shift toward non-oxidative energy metabolism. ATACseq revealed putative oxi-sensitive and tumor-suppressing transcription factors that may regulate important mt functional genes such as the mTORC1 inhibitor, DDIT4/REDD1. DDIT4/REDD1 was predominantly localized to the outer mt membrane in untreated MG-63 cells yet sequestered in the cytoplasm after 1,25(OH)2D3 and rotenone treatments, suggesting a level of control by membrane depolarization to facilitate its cytoplasmic mTORC1 inhibitory function. The results show that vitamin D activates distinct adaptive metabolic responses involving mitochondria to regain redox balance and control the growth of cancer cells.","Cloned animal have been reported by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) for many years. However, the SCNT is extremely inefficient, and zygotic genome activation (ZGA) is required for SCNT and chemical mediated reprogramming. To identify candidate factors that facilitate ZGA in reprogramming, we performed siRNA-repressor and mRNA-inducer screening, which revealed Dux, Dppa2, and Dppa4 as key factors enhancing the ZGA in SCNT. Direct injection of ZGA-inducers had no significant effect on the SCNT blastocyst formation, and even destroyed the ZGA. Through a inducible Dux transgenic mouse model, we demonstrate that transient overexpression of Dux not only improved SCNT efficiency, but also increased the efficiency of chemical reprogramming. Transcriptome profiling revealed that Dux treated SCNT embryos were similar to fertilized embryos. Furthermore, transient overexpression of Dux combined with inactivation of DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts) further promote the overall development of SCNT-derived animals. These findings enhance our understanding of ZGA-regulators in somatic reprogramming.","","Ascorbate (vitamin C) is an essential micronutrient in humans. The chronic severe deficiency of ascorbate, termed scurvy, has long been associated with increased susceptibility to infections. How ascorbate affects the immune system at the cellular and molecular levels remained unclear. Here, from a micronutrient screen, we identified ascorbate as a potent enhancer for antibody response by facilitating the IL-21/STAT3-dependent plasma cell differentiation in mouse and human B cells. The effect of ascorbate is unique, as other antioxidants failed to promote plasma cell differentiation. Ascorbate is critical during early B cell activation by poising the cells to plasma cell lineage without affecting the proximal IL-21/STAT3 signaling and the overall transcriptome. Consistent with its role as a cofactor for epigenetic enzymes, ascorbate potentiates plasma cell differentiation by remodeling the epigenome via TET (Ten Eleven Translocation), the enzymes responsible for DNA demethylation by oxidizing 5-methylcytosines into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). Genome-wide 5hmC profiling identified ascorbate responsive elements (EAR) at the Prdm1 locus, including a distal element with a STAT3 motif overlapped with a CpG that was methylated and modified by TET in the presence of ascorbate. The results suggest that an adequate level of VC is required for antibody response and highlight how micronutrients regulate the activity of epigenetic enzymes to regulate gene expression. Our findings imply that epigenetic enzymes can function as sensors to gauge the availability of metabolites and influence cell fate decisions.","Many studies have shown that socio-economic status (SES) contributes to health inequalities, with nutrition as one of the major risk factors. Iodine intake entirely depends on external sources, and deficiencies are known to be more prevalent in lower social groups, especially in countries with limited access to iodized salt. This study aimed to determine the influence of SES on iodine status and iodine availability from household salt in North Macedonia. Using cluster sampling, 1,200 children were recruited, and 1,191 children participated (response rate: 99.2%). Iodine status was assessed through urinary iodine concentration (UIC), and iodine availability through iodine content in household salt requested from participants. SES was assessed using standardized Family Affluence Score (FAS). No statistically significant correlation was found between FAS and iodine in salt. Median regression revealed no significant associations of middle vs. low FAS (\u03b2=0.00; 95%-confidence interval (CI)=[\u22120.61, 0.62]; p=0.999) or high vs. low affluence (\u03b2=0.48; 95%CI=[\u22121.37, 0.41]; p=0.291) with iodine content in household salt. UIC levels were significantly lower in middle FAS children compared to low FAS children (\u03b2=-16.4; 95%CI=[\u221232.3,-0.5]; p=0.043). No statistically significant differences in UIC were found between children with high and low affluence (\u03b2=-12.5; 95%CI=[\u221235.5, 10.5]; p=0.287), possibly due to lowered statistical power for this comparison. Universal salt iodization (USI) proves to be cost-effective measure for appropriate iodine intake in healthy children and adults, irrespective of their social status. It can thus be concluded that USI contributes to reducing health inequalities related to iodine status among population of different social strata.","BACKGROUND Dermal atrophy (DA) or skin \u201cthinning\u201d can cause a substantial impact on quality of life and, due to barrier function damage, further health problems including cutaneous infection, skin tears and lacerations from minor trauma, impaired wound healing and chronic dermal inflammation. Some dietary products are targeted at therapeutic and functional treatments for skin ageing (of which mild DA is a component); however, while dietary collagen is amongst the most popular, particularly in the form of collagen peptides (CPs), in contrast to reviews for both over-the-counter and under prescription topical treatments for DA (e.g. Tretinoin), there is no reviewed literature of human trials testing the efficacy of orally administered collagen treatments applicable to DA; hence this review.","Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and known carcinogen in the Top 10 on the United States\u2019 list of priority pollutants. Humans are exposed through a variety of sources including tobacco smoke, grilled foods and fossil fuel combustion. Recent studies of children exposed to higher levels of PAHs during pregnancy and early life have identified numerous adverse effects on the brain and behavior that persist into school age and adolescence. Our studies were designed to look for genotype and sex differences in susceptibility to gestational and lactational exposure to BaP using a mouse model with allelic differences in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and the xenobiotic metabolizing enzyme CYP1A2. Pregnant dams were exposed to 10 mg/kg/day of BaP in corn oil-soaked cereal or the corn oil vehicle alone from gestational day 10 until weaning at postnatal day 25. Neurobehavioral testing began at P60 using one male and one female per litter. We found main effects of sex, genotype and treatment as well as significant gene x treatment and sex x treatment interactions. BaP-treated female mice had shorter latencies to fall in the Rotarod test. High-affinity AhrbCyp1a2(\u2212/\u2212) mice had greater impairments in Morris water maze. Interestingly, poor-affinity AhrdCyp1a2(\u2212/\u2212) mice also had deficits in spatial learning and memory regardless of treatment. We believe our findings provide future directions in identifying human populations at highest risk of early life BaP exposure, because our model mimics known human variation in our genes of interest. Our studies also highlight the value of testing both males and females in all neurobehavioral studies.","Alzheimer\u2019s disease is a neuropathological condition with abnormal formation of extracellular Amyloid-\u03b2 plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) of Microtubule-associated protein Tau (Tau) in brain. In pathological condition, MAP-Tau can undergo various post-translational modifications such as hyperphosphorylation by the activity of cellular kinases which eventually leads to protein aggregation in neurons. Melatonin is a hormone which mainly secreted from pineal gland, functions to modulate cellular kinases. In our study, we elucidated that Melatonin has inhibited the Tau aggregates mediated cytotoxicity and membrane leakage by MTT and LDH assay respectively in neuro2A cells. Melatonin has found to reduce the GSK3\u03b2 mRNA expression and protein level by western blot and immunofluorescence assay. Melatonin has also decreased phospho-Tau level (pThr181 and pThr212-pSer214) in neuron cell line upon OA induction as seen by microscopic analysis.. Melatonin treatment has associated with ROS quenching by DCFDA assay, reduced caspase 3 activity in neuronal cells. Further, Melatonin has increased Nrf2 level and nuclear translocation as oxidative stress response in Tauopathy. Together, these findings clearly signifies that Melatonin remediate the Tau-induced neuronal cytotoxicity and reduce Tau hyperphosphorylation via downregulating GSK3\u03b2 expression. Melatonin can combat oxidative damage by Nrf2 activation and nuclear translocation in AD condition.","Wild relatives of tomato are a valuable source of natural variation in tomato breeding, as many can be hybridized to the cultivated species (Solanum lycopersicum). Several, including Solanum lycopersicoides, have been crossed to S. lycopersicum for the development of ordered introgression lines (ILs). Despite the utility of these wild relatives and their associated ILs, limited finished genomes have been produced to aid genetic and genomic studies. We have generated a chromosome-scale genome assembly for Solanum lycopersicoides LA2951 using PacBio sequencing, Illumina, and Hi-C. We identified 37,938 genes based on Illumina and Isoseq and compared gene function to the available cultivated tomato genome resources, in addition to mapping the boundaries of the S. lycopersicoides introgressions in a set of cv. VF36 x LA2951 introgression lines (IL). The genome sequence and IL map will support the development of S. lycopersicoides as a model for studying fruit nutrient/quality, pathogen resistance, and environmental stress tolerance traits that we have identified in the IL population and are known to exist in S. lycopersicoides.","Transfusion of donor-derived red blood cells (RBCs) is the most common form of cell therapy. Production of transfusion-ready cultured RBCs (cRBCs) is a promising replacement for the current fully donor-dependent therapy. However, very large number of cells are required for transfusion. Here we scale-up cRBC production from static cultures to 0.5 L stirred tank bioreactors, and identify the effect of operating conditions on the efficiency of the process. Oxygen requirement of proliferating erythroblasts (0.55-2.01 pg/cell/h) required sparging of air to maintain the dissolved oxygen concentration at the tested setpoint (2.88 mg O2/L). Erythroblasts could be cultured at dissolved oxygen concentrations as low as 0.7 O2 mg/mL without negative impact on proliferation, viability or differentiation dynamics. Stirring speeds of up to 600 rpm supported erythroblast proliferation, while 1800 rpm led to a transient halt in growth and accelerated differentiation followed by a recovery after 5 days of culture. Erythroblasts could also be differentiated in bioreactors, with final enucleation levels and hemoglobin content similar to parallel cultures under static conditions. After defining optimal mixing and aeration strategies, erythroblast proliferation cultures were successfully scaled up to 3 L bioreactors.","Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is characterised by descending skeletal muscle weakness and wasting. FSHD is caused by mis-expression of the transcription factor DUX4, which is linked to oxidative stress, a condition especially detrimental to skeletal muscle with its high metabolic activity and energy demands. Oxidative damage characterises FSHD and recent work suggests metabolic dysfunction and perturbed hypoxia signalling as novel pathomechanisms. However, redox biology of FSHD remains poorly understood, and integrating the complex dynamics of DUX4-induced metabolic changes is lacking.","Metabolic aberrations are a prominent feature of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD). Different neuronal subtypes have selective vulnerability in AD. Despite the recent advance of single cell and single nucleus RNA-seq of AD brains, genome-scale metabolic network changes in neuronal subtypes have not been systematically studied with detail. To bridge this knowledge gap, I developed a computational method called perturb-Met that can uncover transcriptional dysregulation centered at hundreds of metabolites in a metabolic network. perturb-Met successfully recapitulated known glycolysis, cholesterol, and other metabolic defects in APOE4-neurons and microglia, many of which are missed by current methods. Applying perturb-Met on AD snRNA-seq data, I revealed that the four neuronal subtypes in the entorhinal cortex shows subtype-specific metabolic changes, namely mitochondrial complex I metabolism, ganglioside metabolism, galactose and heparan sulfate metabolism, as well as glucose and lipid metabolism, respectively. perturb-Met also revealed significant changes in protein glycosylation in the neuron subtype specifically found in AD brains. These subtype-specific metabolic changes may potentially underlie their selective vulnerability in AD. perturb-Met is a valuable tool to discover potential metabolic network changes in many other single cell or bulk transcriptomic studies.","Insulin-secreting \u03b2-cells within the pancreatic islets of Langerhans are lost in patients with type 1 diabetes1. Islets can be generated in vitro by differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells2\u20135, but understanding of the molecular events governing this process is limited. Here, we use single-cell multiomics to measure chromatin accessibility and transcriptional profiles of 120,064 cells to characterize and delineate maturation of islets from in vitro differentiation. We find distinguishing chromatin accessibility and gene expression signatures as well as dynamic profiles for each major islet cell type produced from in vitro differentiation. Furthermore, based on chromatin accessibility, \u03b2, \u03b1, and \u03b4 cells from in vitro differentiation are more ambiguous in their cellular identity than from isolated primary islets. However, extended time in vitro or with transplantation into mice drives more distinct states of chromatin accessibility for each cell type. Modulation of CTCF expression redirects cell fate from pancreatic islet endocrine to an intestinal enteroendocrine-like cell type. Additionally, knockdown of ARID1B enhances \u03b2-cell maturation transcriptionally and by chromatin accessibility. These results provide a comprehensive atlas and insights into cell fate identity and maturation of stem cell-derived islets, which will inform on their utility for therapy and disease modeling6\u20138.","The support of pluripotent cells over time is an essential feature of development. In eutherian embryos, pluripotency is maintained from na\u00efve states in peri-implantation to primed pluripotency at gastrulation. To understand how these states emerged, we reconstruct the evolutionary trajectory of the Pou5 gene family, which contains the central pluripotency factor OCT4. By coupling evolutionary sequence analysis with functional studies in mouse Embryonic Stem Cells (ESCs), we found that the ability of POU5 proteins to support pluripotency originated in the gnathostome lineage, prior to the generation of two paralogues, Pou5f1 and Pou5f3 via gene duplication. In osteichthyans, retaining both genes, the paralogues differ in their support of na\u00efve and primed pluripotency. This specialization of these duplicates enables the diversification of function in self-renewal and differentiation. By integrating sequence evolution, ESC phenotypes, developmental contexts and structural modelling, we pinpoint OCT4 regions sufficient for na\u00efve pluripotency and describe their adaptation over evolutionary time.","Neural stem cells (NSCs) have great potential in the application of neurodegenerative disease therapy, drug screening and disease modeling. NSC can be generated by reprogramming from terminally differentiated cells with transcription factors or small molecules. However, current methods for producing NSCs involve the danger of integrating foreign genes into the genome and the problem of low efficiency. Here, we report an efficient method to generate NSCs from human skin-derived fibroblasts with microRNA (mir-302a) in 2-3 days. The induced NSCs (iNSCs) have more than 90% of purity. Their morphology is similar to regular NSCs, expressing key markers including Nestin, Pax6 and Sox2, and can be expanded for more than 20 passages in vitro. They can also differentiate into functional neuron progeny, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes as well. Those cells can elicit action potential, can be xeno-transplanted into the brain of immune-deficient mice, and can survive and differentiate in vivo without tumor formation. This study shows that a single part of pluripotency-inducing mir-302 cluster can drive fibroblasts reprogramming, providing a general platform for high-efficiency generation of individual-specific human NSCs for studies of neuron system development and regenerative cell therapy.","Chronic inflammatory diseases are characterized by complex interactions between genetic predisposition and tissue-specific immune responses. This heterogeneity complicates diagnoses and the ability to exploit omics approaches to improve disease management, develop more effective therapeutics, and apply precision medicine. Using skin inflammation as a model, we developed a method that integrates deep clinical phenotyping information (phenomics) with transcriptome data of lesional and non-lesional skin (564 samples) to identify clinically-relevant gene signatures. It led us to discover so-far unexplored factors, including CCAAT Enhancer-Binding Protein Beta (CEBPB) in neutrophil invasion, and Pituitary Tumor-Transforming 2 (PTTG2) in the pathogenic epithelial response to inflammation. These factors were validated using genetically-modified human skin equivalents, migration assays, and in situ imaging. Thus, by meaningful integration of deep clinical phenotyping and omics data we reveal hidden drivers of clinically-relevant biological processes.","Microvessels are essential for tissue engineering and regeneration. In current methods, endothelial cells are usually cultured in commercially available media and form a monolayer of cell sheets on stiff substrates and a tubular structure when cultured with soft hydrogels. To mimic the microvessels in vivo, researchers usually coculture the endothelial cells and pericytes from different adult tissues or derived from pluripotent stem cells in a three-dimensional hydrogel. However, there is a challenge for these models to reflect tissue-specific characteristics due to the vascular heterogeneity throughout the body. Here, we established a culture model for expanding adult tubular microvessels on stiff substrates with endothelial cells and pericytes derived from the same tissue. We isolated microvessels from adult rat subcutaneous soft connective tissue and cultured them on regular plastic dishes. We performed a series of screenings and formulated a custom-made medium (Medium-X), containing mainly antioxidants and three small molecules, Chir99021, A83-01, and Y27632. Medium-X significantly promoted adult microvessel growth while maintaining their characteristic tubular morphology up to 8 weeks in vitro, contrary to the monolayer of endothelial cell sheets in the commercially available medium EGM2MV. Transcriptomic analysis showed that Medium-X maintained the tubular morphology of microvessels by promoting angiogenesis and vascular remodeling while suppressing oxidation and lipid metabolic pathways. The model presented in this study can be applied to other organs for expanding organ-specific microvessels for tissue engineering and vascular regeneration.","","","","","Post-fabrication formation of a proper vasculature remains an unresolved challenge in bioprinting. Established strategies focus on the supply of the fabricated structure with nutrients and oxygen and either rely on the mere formation of a channel system using fugitive inks, or additionally use mature endothelial cells and/or peri-endothelial cells such as smooth muscle cells for the formation of blood vessels in vitro. Functional vessels, however, exhibit a hierarchical organization and multilayered wall structure that is important for their function. Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived mesodermal progenitor cells (hiMPCs) have been shown to possess the capacity to form blood vessels in vitro, but have so far not been assessed for their applicability in bioprinting processes. Here, we demonstrate that hiMPCs, after formulation into an alginate / collagen type 1 bioink and subsequent extrusion, retain their ability to give rise to the formation of complex vessels that display a hierarchical network in a process that mimicks the embryonic steps of vessel formation by vasculogenesis. Histological evaluations at different time points of extrusion revealed initial formation of spheres, followed by lumen formation and further structural maturation as evidenced by building a multilayered vessel wall and a vascular network. These findings are supported by immunostainings for endothelial and peri-endothelial cell markers as well as electron microscopic analyses at the ultrastructural level. Moreover, capillary-like vessel structures deposited a basement membrane-like matrix structure at the basal side between the vessel wall and the alginate-collagen matrix. These results evidence the applicability and great potential of hiMPCs for the bioprinting of vascular structures mimicking the basic morphogenetic steps of de novo vessel formation during embryogenesis.","","Deficiency of Glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is the single most common enzymopathy, present in approximately 400 million humans (e.g. 5% of humans). Its prevalence is hypothesized to be due to conferring resistance to malaria. However, G6PD deficiency also results in hemolytic sequelae from oxidant stress. Moreover, G6PD deficiency is associated with kidney disease, diabetes, pulmonary hypertension, immunological defects, and neurodegenerative diseases. To date, the only available mouse models have decreased levels of G6PD due to promoter mutations, but with stable G6PD. However, human G6PD mutations are missense mutations that result in decreased enzymatic stability. As such, this results in very low activity in red blood cells and platelets that cannot synthesize new protein. To generate a more accurate model, the human sequence for a severe form of G6PD deficiency (Med -) was knocked into the murine G6PD locus. As predicted, G6PD levels were extremely low in RBCs and deficient mice have increased hemolytic sequalae to oxidant stress. G6PD levels were mildly decreased in non-erythroid organs, consistent with what has been observed in humans. Juxtaposition of G6PD deficient and wild-type mice revealed altered lipid metabolism in multiple organ systems. Together, these findings both establish a new mouse model of G6PD deficiency that more accurately reflects human G6PD deficiency and also advance our basic understanding of altered metabolism in this setting.","Background A diet rich in cruciferous vegetables is reported to have beneficial health effects, partially mediated by 4-methylsulfinylbutyl glucosinolate, or glucoraphanin, which is predominantly found within broccoli (Brassica oleracea var italica). We describe the downstream effects on transcription and metabolism in broccoli following the introgression of a genetic variant of MYB28 into broccoli from a wild Brassica relative which has previously been associated with enhancement of glucoraphanin.","Pluripotent cells of the mammalian embryo undergo extensive chromatin rewiring to prepare for lineage commitment after implantation. Repressive H3K27me3, deposited by Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), is reallocated from large gene-distal blankets in pre-implantation embryos to mark promoters of developmental genes. The factors that mediate this global redistribution of H3K27me3 are unknown. Here we report a post-translational mechanism that destabilizes PRC2 to constrict H3K27me3 during lineage commitment. Using an auxin-inducible degron system, we show that the deubiquitinase Usp9x is required for mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell self-renewal. Usp9x-high ES cells have high PRC2 levels and bear a chromatin and transcriptional signature of the pre-implantation embryo, whereas Usp9x-low ES cells resemble the post-implantation, gastrulating epiblast. We show that Usp9x interacts with, deubiquitinates and stabilizes PRC2. Deletion of Usp9x in post-implantation embryos results in the derepression of genes that normally gain H3K27me3 after gastrulation, followed by the appearance of morphological abnormalities at E9.5, pointing to a recurrent link between Usp9x and PRC2 during development. Usp9x is a marker of \u201cstemness\u201d and is mutated in various neurological disorders and cancers. Our results unveil a Usp9x-PRC2 regulatory axis that is critical at peri-implantation and may be redeployed in other stem cell fate transitions and disease states.","MicroRNA-155 (miR155) is overexpressed in various inflammatory diseases and cancer, in which bone resorption and osteolysis are frequently observed. However, the role of miR155 on osteogenesis and bone mass phenotype is still unknown. Here, we report a low bone mass phenotype in the long bone of miR155-Tg mice compared with control mice. In contrast, miR155-KO mice showed a high bone mass phenotype. miR155-KO mice showed robust bone regeneration in the ectopic and orthotopic model, but miR155-Tg mice showed compromised bone regeneration compared with the control mice. Similarly, the osteogenic differentiation potential of bone marrow stromal stem cells (BMSCs) from miR155-KO mice was robust and miR155-Tg was compromised compared with that of control mice. Moreover, miR155 knockdown in BMSCs from control mice showed higher osteogenic differentiation potential, supporting the results from miR155-KO mice. TargetScan analysis predicted S1PR1 as a target gene of miR155, which was further confirmed by luciferase assay and miR155 knockdown. S1PR1 overexpression in BMSCs robustly promoted osteogenic differentiation without affecting cell viability and proliferation. Thus, miR155 showed a catabolic effect on osteogenesis and bone mass phenotype via interaction with the S1PR1 gene, suggesting inhibition of miR155 as a potential strategy for bone regeneration and bone defect healing.","","Background Nutritional deficiencies have many immediate and long-term effects on physical and cognitive development outcomes, with the children not achieving their full potential. A milk-based health drink fortified with micronutrients as a part of a daily balanced diet can promote physical and cognitive growth in children by increasing macronutrients and micronutrients availability in the body. The systematic analysis aims to quantify the effect of a formulated health drink on children\u2019s physical, clinical, and cognitive development outcomes.","The suture strings is a particularly important pod trait that determines the quality and texture of snap bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). The St locus on chromosome 2 has been described as a major locus associated with suture strings. However, the gene and genetic basis underlying this locus remain unknown. Here, we investigated the suture strings of 138 snap bean accessions across two years. A total of 3.66 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were obtained by deep resequencing. Based on these SNPs, we identified a strong association signal on Chr02 and a promising candidate gene, PvGUX1_1. Further analysis revealed that the 2-bp deletion in exon of PvGUX1_1 was significantly associated with stringlessness. Comparative mapping indicated that PvGUX1_1 was a domesticated locus and diverged from PvGUX1_2 during an early stage. Our study provides important insights into the genetic mechanism of suture string formation and useful information for snap bean improvement.","Recent studies demonstrated that human trophoblast stem-like cells (hTS-like cells) can be derived from na\u00efve embryonic stem cells or be induced from somatic cells by the pluripotency factors, OSKM. This raises two main questions; (i) whether human induced TSCs (hiTSCs) can be generated independently to pluripotent state or factors and (ii) what are the mechanisms by which hTSC state is established during reprogramming. Here, we identify GATA3, OCT4, KLF4 and MYC (GOKM) as a pluripotency-independent combination of factors that can generate stable and functional hiTSCs, from both male and female fibroblasts. By using single and double knockout (KO) fibroblasts for major pluripotency genes (i.e. SOX2 or NANOG/PRDM14) we show that GOKM not only is capable of generating hiTSCs from the KO cells, but rather that the efficiency of the process is increased. Through H3K4me2 and chromatin accessibility profiling we demonstrate that GOKM target different loci and genes than OSKM, and that a significant fraction of them is related to placenta and trophoblast function. Moreover, we show that GOKM exert a greater pioneer activity compared to OSKM. While GOKM target many specific hTSC loci, OSKM mainly target hTSC loci that are shared with hESCs. Finally, we reveal a gene signature of trophoblast-related genes, consisting of 172 genes which are highly expressed in blastocyst-derived TSCs and GOKM-hiTSCs but absent or mildly expressed in OSKM-hiTSCs.","Global warming is escalating with increased temperatures reported worldwide. Given the enormous land mass on the planet, biological capture of CO2 remains a viable approach to mitigate the crisis as it is economical and easy to implement. In this study, a gene capable of CO2 capture was identified via selection in minimal media. This mitochondrial gene named as OG1 encodes the OK/SW-CL.16 protein and shares homology with cytochrome oxidase subunit III of various species and PII uridylyl-transferase from Loktanella vestfoldensis SKA53. CO2 capture experiments indicate that \u03b413C was substantially higher in the cells harboring the gene OG1 than the control in the nutrition-poor media. This study suggests that CO2 capture using engineered microorganisms in barren land can be exploited to address the soaring CO2 level in the atmosphere, opening up vast land resources to cope with global warming.","The facts of postharvest food loss and waste and the resulting consequences affect us in many ways, ranging from important economic and social issues to lasting and detrimental environmental problems. We are using genomic tools to understand senescence in postharvest broccoli florets when stored at room temperature or 4 \u00b0C. The RNA-sequencing approaches provide key insights into the gradual changes in transcriptome profiling in broccoli during postharvest storage. Identification of those key factors could lead to a better understanding of gene regulation of postharvest senescence. Those genes could serve as \u2018freshness-indicators\u2019 that have the potential to mediate senescence and to generate germplasm for breeding new varieties with longer shelf-life in Brassica vegetables. Such a tool would also allow a new level of postharvest logistics based on physiological age, supporting improved availability of high-quality, nutritious, fresh vegetables and fruits.","","The critical cellular transitions that govern human pancreas development are largely unknown. We performed large-scale single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq) to interrogate human fetal pancreas development from 8-20 weeks post conception. We identified 103 distinct cell types, including four novel endocrine progenitor subtypes displaying unique transcriptional features and differentiation potency. Integration with single-nucleus Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin Sequencing (snATAC-Seq) identified candidate regulators of human endocrine cell fate and revealed development-specific regulatory annotation at diabetes risk loci. Comparison of in vitro stem cell-derived and endogenous endocrine cells predicted aberrant genetic programs leading to the generation of off-target cells. Finally, knock-out studies revealed that the gene FEV regulates human endocrine differentiation. This work establishes a roadmap of human pancreatic development, highlights previously unappreciated cellular diversity and lineage dynamics, and provides a blueprint for understanding pancreatic disease and physiology, as well as generating human stem cell-derived islet cells in vitro for regenerative medicine purposes.","Background Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck peels are usually discarded as wastes; however, they are rich sources of Vitamin C, fibre, and many nutrients including phenolics and flavonoids which are also good antioxidant agents. This study aimed to examine phytochemical composition, antioxidant capabilities, cytotoxicity of C. sinensis (L.) Osbeck peel extract and and to compare the antibacterial activity with zinc nanoparticles of Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck peels with its extract. GC-MS analysis of the compounds present in the peels extract of Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck was also done.","Increasing weather aberrations cause frequent crop failure in monoculture cropping system. Specialized crop production systems, where few seasonal crops occupy vast arable lands, resulting in more biotic and abiotic stresses in agri-ecosystem. Therefore a diversified agroforestry systemwas evaluated to ensure resilience underlimited water conditions, with an aim to augment carbon footprint with enhanced productivity and profitability. The study hypothesised that integration of perennial fruits trees with seasonal crops will have benign effect for sequestering more carbon and improving livelihood of the farmers. This is one of the first timesthat arid fruits tress along with leguminous,and other low water requiring crops were studied for improved carbon sequestration, livelihood of the farmers andfor better resilience in production system. The experimental findings showed that arid fruit trees along with leguminous, oilseeds and cash crops resulted in higher profitability and thus improved livelihood of the farmersin arid and semi-arid areas of South Asia. Diversified phalsa-mung bean-potato and moringa-mung bean-potato were the most productive agroforestry system (36.7t/ha and 36.2 t/ha respectively. Under limited irrigation conditions, Karonda (Carisa spp.)-mung bean potato system was found best in improving livelihood with maximum net return of $ 3529.1/ha with higher profitability/day ($ 19.9/day). Phalsa -MB-potato system was also recorded maximum water use efficiency (33.0 kg/ha-mm), whereas density of SOC was in Phalsa-cowpea-mustard (9.10 Mg/ha) and moringa-mung bean -potato AFS (9.16 Mg/ha). Carbon footprint analysis revealed that maximum net C gain was in Phalsa-mung bean -potato system (7030 Carbon equivalent kg CE/ha/year).","This study evaluated the larvicidal activity of O. majorana essential oil, identified the chemical composition, evaluated the antimicrobial, cytotoxic and antioxidant potential. The larvicidal activity was evaluated against larvae of the third stage of Aedes aegypti, whereas the chemical composition was identified by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometer, the antimicrobial activity was carried out against the bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus auereus, the antioxidant activity was evaluated from of 2.2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazila sequestration and Artemia salina cytotoxicity. Regarding to the results, the larvicidal activity showed that O. majorana essential oil caused high mortality in A. aegypti larvae. In the chromatographic analysis, the main component found in O. majorana essential oil was pulegone (57.05%), followed by the other components verbenone (16.92%), trans-p-menthan-2-one (8.57%), iso-menthone (5.58%), piperitone (2.83%), 3-octanol (2.35%) and isopulegol (1.47%). The antimicrobial activity showed that E. coli and P. aeruginosa bacteria were more sensitive to oil than S. aureus, which was resistant at all concentrations. Essential oil did not present antioxidant activity, but it has high cytotoxic activity against A. salina.","A significant amount of vascular thrombotic events is associated with rupture of the fibrous cap that overlie atherosclerotic plaques. Cap rupture is however difficult to predict due to the heterogenous composition of the plaque, unknown material properties, and the stochastic nature of the event. Here, we aim to create tissue engineered human fibrous cap models with a variable but controllable collagen composition, suitable for mechanical testing, to scrutinize the reciprocal relationships between composition and mechanical properties.","","The Erzincan plain is one of the richest regions in Turkey in terms of plant biodiversity. In this region, the famous grape cultivar 'Karaerik' has always dominated grape production due to its berry characteristics. The cultivar shows great morphological variation at clonal level. In this study, the total phenolic content and antioxidant activity of peel, pulp and seed extracts of nine 'Karaerik' clones sampled from same location were investigated. The Folin-Ciocalteu method was used to determine the total phenolic content of peel, pulp and seed extracts of nine clones. To determine antioxidant activity, three well known assays such as DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate), FRAP (Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power) and TEAC (Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity) were used. In addition, the correlation between total phenol content and DPPH, FRAP and TEAC was determined. Results showed that among the tissues, seed samples in berries of all clones had the highest total phenol content and antioxidant activity determined by three assays. Seed samples were followed by peel and pulp for total phenolic content and antioxidant activity. Among the nine 'Karaerik' clones, Clone 8 had the highest total phenolic content (149 mg GAE/100 g FW) while Clone 3 had the lowest (111 mg GAE/100 g FW). Peel, pulp and seed samples of nine 'Karaerik' clones showed strong antioxidant activity in DPPH, FRAP and TEAC assays. In particular, grape seeds were found rich for better in phenolic compounds including gallic acid, quercetin, catechin, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid and p-coumaric acid. Clones such as 7, 8 and 9 higher antioxidant activity may present great potential for grape breeders and the food industry as well as health-conscious consumers. ","","Date fruits are endowed with medicinal values, including boosting the male fertility status, but with meagre empirical evidence. Thus, the current study was designed to assess the ameliorative and potential adverse effects of date fruit extracts (Phoenix dactylifera) on cypermethrin-induced male infertility. The study was conducted in two phases using adult male Wistar rats (n = 42, 180 \u2013 220 g and aged 14 - 16 weeks). The first phase was a single oral dose toxicity study to ascertain the suitability of date fruit extract and cypermethrin administered at 250 mg/kg and 60 mg/kg, respectively. The second phase, which included four treatment groups of six animals per group, assessed the effects of date fruits on cypermethrin-induced infertility. At the termination of the experiment, semen was collected by epididymal extraction for the assessment of sperm abnormalities, motility, mass activity, semen pH, and percentage live. Serum samples were also collected for testosterone and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) profiling, and the collected data was subjected to statistical analysis. The group administered only cypermethrin showed a decrease in percentage motility, live, mass activity and an increase in total abnormalities over the control group while the group exposed to only date fruits extracts showed increased percentage motility, live, mass activity and a decrease in total abnormalities over the control. The results of a combined administration of date fruit extracts and cypermethrin on a separate group showed a consistently reduced percentage of anatomically abnormal sperm cells and a general improvement of sperm motility and mass activity. There was no significant difference in the weight of the Wister rats in all the groups (p &gt; 0.05). However, testosterone and FSH levels were significantly reduced (p &lt; 0.05) by date fruit extract treatment. The current report provides evidence of the potential ameliorative effects of date fruit extracts in cypermethrin-induced male infertility and cautions excessive use or abuse since some adverse effects were observed.","","It is important to search for new sources of bioactive, natural compounds because customers pay more attention to food quality. Fruits and berries from horticultural plants are known to be good sources of agents beneficial for human well-being and could serve as natural preservatives in the food industry. However, more recent research indicates that other plant organs can also be rich in nutrients. Our study focused on characterizing an unexplored source: leaf and twig extracts from Rosa canina. The chemical composition of these extracts was analyzed and their in vitro activity measured. HPLC analysis of the content of phenolics, vitamins and amino acids revealed that the leaf and twig extracts are rich in bioactive compounds with potent antioxidant properties. The greatest differences between bioactive phenolic compounds in leaf and twig extracts related mainly to p-coumaric acid, myricetin, ellagic acid, cyanidin, procyanidin and quercetin, whereas salicylic acid levels were similar in both types of extract.","Background Micronutrients are essential for the body to produce enzymes, hormones and other substances essential for proper growth and development. Iodine, potassium iodide and ascorbic acid are ones of the most important in global public health terms. However, their lack represents a major threat to the human and animal health.","The non-animal peroxidases belong to a superfamily of oxidoreductases that reduce the hydrogen peroxide and oxidize numerous substrates. Since their initial characterization in 1992, several advances have provided an understanding into the origin and evolutionary history of this family of proteins. Here, we report for the first time an exhaustive evolutionary analysis of non-animal peroxidases using integrated in silico and biochemical strategies. Thanks to the availability of numerous genomic sequences from many species belonging to different kingdoms together with expert and exhaustive annotation of peroxidase sequences centralized in a dedicated database, we have deepened our understanding of the evolutionary process underlying non-animal peroxidases through phylogenetic reconstructions. We analysed the distribution of all non-animal peroxidases in more than 200 eukaryotic organisms in silico. First, we show that the presence or absence of non-animal peroxidases can be correlated with the presence or absence of certain organelles or with specific biological processes. Examining a wide range of organisms, we confirmed that ascorbate peroxidases (APx) and cytochromes c peroxidases (CcP) were detected respectively in chloroplast and mitochondria containing organisms. Plants, which contain both organelles, are an exception and contain only APxs without CcP. Class III peroxidases (CIII Prx) were only detected in plants and Class II peroxidases (CII Prx) in fungi related to wood decay and plant degradation.","The coronaviral pandemic is exerting a tremendously detrimental impact on global health, quality of life and the world economy, emphasizing the need for effective medications for current and future coronaviral outbreaks as a complementary approach to vaccines. The Spike protein, responsible for cell receptor binding and viral internalization, possesses multiple disulfide bonds raising the possibility that disulfide-reducing agents might disrupt Spike function, prevent viral entry and serve as effective drugs against SARS-CoV-2. Here we show the first experimental evidence that reagents capable of reducing disulfide bonds can inhibit viral infection in cell-based assays. Molecular dynamics simulations of the Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) predict increased domain flexibility when the four disulfide bonds of the domain are reduced. This flexibility is particularly prominent for the surface loop, comprised of residues 456-490, which interacts with the Spike cell receptor ACE2. Consistent with this finding, the addition of exogenous disulfide bond reducing agents affects the RBD secondary structure, lowers its melting temperature from 52 to 36-39\u00b0C and decreases its binding affinity to ACE2 by two orders of magnitude at 37\u00b0C. Finally, the reducing agents dithiothreitol (DTT) and tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) inhibit viral replication at high \u00b5M \u2013 low mM levels with a negligible effect on cell viability at these concentrations. The antiviral effect of monothiol-based reductants N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and reduced glutathione (GSH) was not observed due to decreases in cell viability. Our research demonstrates the clear potential for medications that disrupt Spike disulfides as broad-spectrum anticoronaviral agents and as a first-line defense against current and future outbreaks.","Background Acrylamide (ACR) is a naturally occurring, widely used compound, it is generated during cocking carbohydrate rich food at high temperature. Ingestion of large amounts of ACR underlies several health concerns and teratogenicity. Ascorbic acid (vit C) is a strong reducing agent greatly used to clean free radicals.","The biodiversity of Ecuadorian stingless bees is almost 200 species. Traditional pot-honey harvest in Ecuador is mostly done from nests of the three genera selected here Geotrigona Moure, 1942, Melipona, Illiger, 1806 and Scaptotrigona, Moure 1943. The 20 pot-honey samples collected from cerumen pots and three ethnic honeys Abeja de tierra, Bermejo, and Cushillomishki were analyzed for qualitative and quantitative 1H-NMR honey profiling and for the Honey Authenticity Test by Interphase Emulsion (HATIE). Extensive data of targeted organic compounds (41 parameters) was identified, quantified and described. The three honey types were compared by ANOVA. Amino acids, ethanol, hydroxymethylfurfural, aliphatic organic acids, sugars, and markers of botanical or entomological origin. The number of phases observed with the HATIE was one in Scaptotrigona and three in Geotrigona and Melipona honeys. Acetic acid (19.60 g/kg) and lactic acid (24.30 g/kg) were particularly high in Geotrigona honey (in contrast to 1.3 g/kg acetic acid and 1.6 g/kg lactic acid in Melipona and Scaptotrigona), with the lowest fructose + glucose (18.39) g/100g honey compared to Melipona (52.87) and Scaptotrigona (52.17). Three local honeys were tested using PCA (Principal Component Analysis), two were assigned with a correct declared bee origin, but Bermejo was not a Melipona and grouped with the Scaptotrigona cluster. However, after HCA (Hierarchical Cluster Analysis), the three kinds of honey were positioned in the Melipona-Scaptotrigona cluster. This research supports the targeted NMR-based profiling in pot-honey metabolomics approach for multi-parameter visualization of organic compounds, descriptive and pertained multivariate statistics (Hierarchical Cluster Analysis HCA, and Principal Component Analysis PCA) to discriminate the stingless bee genus in a set of Geotrigona, Melipona, and Scaptotrigona honey types. The NMR characterization of Ecuadorian honey produced by stingless bees is a contribution to the needed regulatory norms. A final note on searching stingless bee markers in pot-honey metabolites that may become nutritional trait candidates for phylogeny. Scaptotrigona honey revealed biosurfactant activity in the HATIE, originating a fingerprint Honey Biosurfactant Test (HBT) for the genus in this set of pot-honeys.","Lycium barbarum, commonly known as goji berry, Chinese berry, or Tibetian berry, is emerging as a popular \u201csuperfood\u201d with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Goji berry is being used for the treatment of various cancers, gastrointestional disorders, stroke, diabetes, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and glaucoma. However, its use for management of oral inflammatory diseases has not been explored. Therefore, the present study aims to evaluate the antimicrobial, anti-adhesion, and anti-biofilm, and cytotoxic properties of an ethanolic extract of Lycium barbarum (LBE) against oral and periodontal pathogens. The antimicrobial properties of LBE against five microorganisms were tested and compared against Chlorhexidine and doxycycline along with cytotoxicity and cell viability on the gingival fibroblast and modified keratinocyte cell lines. The anti-adhesion and anti-biofilm properties of LBE against Porphyromonas gingivalis, at its minimal bactericidal value, were evaluated. The antimicrobial, anti-adhesion and antibiofilm properties of LBE were found to be comparable to chlorhexidine but less than that of doxycycline. The LBE extract was also compactible to gingival fibroblast tissues and oral keratinocytes at 1 mg/ml. The results proved that goji berry is as effective as chlorhexidine and can be used as a promising natural herb for the management of inflammatory diseases of oral cavity.","The diverse cultivars of Brassica oleracea and Brassica napus constitute an important global food source. Of those, the Brassica oleracea convar. acephala cultivar group containing var. sabellica and var. palmifolia and Brassica napus var. pabularia, collectively known as kale, are nutritious leafy greens consumed for their abundance of vitamins and micronutrients. Typified by their curly, serrated or wavy leaves, kale varieties have been primarily defined based on their leaf morphology and geographic origin, despite having complex genetic backgrounds. Kale is a very promising crop for vertical farming due to its high nutritional content. However, systematic analysis of kale growth and molecular composition under different light regimes suitable for vertical farming has been lacking. Hence, we selected nine diverse, publicly available and commercially grown kale cultivars for growth under light emitting diode (LED)-replicated sunlight-like conditions. We then analyzed their growth and nutrition using a combination of phenomics, proteomics and metabolomics. As plant growth and development are driven by the diel molecular activities of plants, we harvested kale leaf tissue at both end-of-day (ED) and end-of-night (EN) time-points for all molecular analyses. Our results reveal that diel metabolome and proteome signatures sub-divide the selected kale cultivars into two distinct groups, defined by their amino acid and sugar content, along with significant proteome differences involving carbon and nitrogen metabolism, mRNA splicing, protein translation and light harvesting. Together, our analysis has generated robust quantitative insights into the diel growth and development landscape of kale, significantly advancing our fundamental understanding of this nutritious leafy green for next-generation breeding and biotechnology.","\u03b2 cells may participate and contribute to their own demise during Type 1 diabetes (T1D). We identified a novel role of Tet2 in regulating immune killing of \u03b2 cells. Tet2 is induced in murine and human \u03b2 cells with inflammation but its expression is reduced in surviving \u03b2 cells. Tet2-KO mice that receive WT bone marrow transplants develop insulitis but not diabetes and islet infiltrates do not eliminate \u03b2 cells even though immune cells from the mice can transfer diabetes to NOD/scid recipients. Tet2-KO \u03b2 cells show reduced expression of inflammatory genes, associated with closed transcription factor binding sites. Tet2-KO recipients are protected from transfer of disease by diabetogenic immune cells. We conclude that Tet2 regulates pathologic interactions between \u03b2 cells and immune cells and controls intrinsic protective pathways. Modulating TET2 may enable survival of \u03b2 cells or their replacements in the setting of pathologic immune cells.","Cassava (Manihot esculenta crantz) is a major food crop in Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, the Pacific, and South America, where it feeds around 800 million people. Its roots are an excellent source of energy, and its leaves are rich in minerals, vitamins, and protein, which could substantially supplement the current starchy diets if properly detoxified since they contain some toxic anti-nutritional factors. The objective of this study was to provide information on the nutritional profile of cassava root and leaves and role of processing in enhancing and stabilizing their valuable nutrients. Two cassava varieties, kello and qulle, obtained from Areca Agricultural Research Center were used in this study. Roots and leaves were processed (fermented, boiled, and fluid bed dried), and nutritional, anti-nutritional, and functional properties were assessed using AOAC (Association of Official Analytical Chemists) standard procedures. As compared to leaves, roots had higher carbohydrate contents, ranging from 81.0 to 87.1 g/100g, whereas leaves had higher protein (21.2 to 28.4g/100g), total carotenoid (234.1 to 987.9 \u03bcg/g), fiber (16.1 to 22.9 g/100g), Ca (499.8 to 545.4 mg/100g), K (1193.4 to 1211.0 mg/100g), Mg (274.5 to 340.5 mg/100g) and Fe (129.1 to 146.1 mg/kg) contents. Anti-nutritional factors were slightly higher in the leaves than in the roots, with toxic cyanides ranging from 10.1 to 61.0 mg/kg in the leaves and from 1.8 to 47.5 mg/kg in the roots. However, the processing of leaves decreased cyanide content from 61.0 mg/kg to 10.1 mg/kg. Similarly, other anti-nutritional factors, such as condensed tannins, oxalates, and phytate were reduced from 52.0 to 21.0 mg/100g, 156.5 to 25.9 mg/100g, and 35.9 to 4.0 mg/100g), respectively. Hence, the fermentation of leaves and roots followed by boiling and drying is an interesting approach to reduce anti-nutritional factors significantly and ensure their nutritional quality. This study revealed that variety kello had a relatively better nutritional profile than variety qulle, for both root and leaves, except for total carotenoid content, which was higher in the latter. Genetic background and processing methods can greatly affect the nutritional profile of cassava varieties, so it is critical to analyze diverse cassava germplasm and refine the processing method to identify highly nutritious and healthy varieties.","Sweet potato leaves are consumed as green leafy vegetables in most of the world due to their nutritional and functional values, and the taste characteristics determine their commodity value and consumer acceptance. However, the metabolic composition and formation mechanism of taste quality in its leaves are not clear. In this study, we found that sweet potato leaves under different growing patterns, soil culture and hydroponic culture, which result in different taste quality. In particular, the taste quality in leafy sweet potato was effectively improved under hydroponic culture. Meanwhile, we further profiled metabolites in leaves of sweet potatoes under different growing patterns by using GC\u2013QToF\u2013MS. A total of 200 metabolites were identified, covering most of the metabolic pathways in plants. A comparison of the good taste and poor taste of sweet potato leaves resulted in 71 metabolites related to taste quality formation. In addition, the leaves with poor taste had lower levels of metabolites regarding amino acids metabolism, whereas was accompanied by high levels of metabolites in carbohydrates and secondary metabolism. This study provides new insights into the improvement of taste quality in leafy sweet potato.","Biosynthesis of l-ascorbate (AsA) in plants is carried out by a complex metabolic network, which involves d-mannose/l-galactose, d-galacturonate, l-gulose, and myo-inositol as main precursors. Arabidopsis lines over-expressing enzymes in the myo-inositol pathway have elevated AsA, accumulate more biomass of both aerial and root tissues, and are tolerant to abiotic stresses as shown by manual and digital phenotyping. We crossed myo-inositol oxygenase (MIOX4) over-expressers with two low-vitamin C mutants (vtc1-1 and vtc2-1) encoding enzymes involved in d-mannose/l-galactose route. The purpose of developing these crosses was to test MIOX4\u2019s ability to restore the low AsA phenotype in mutants, and to assess the contribution of individual biosynthetic pathways to abiotic stress tolerance. We used a powerful high-throughput phenotyping platform for detailed phenotypic characterization of the Arabidopsis crosses with visible, fluorescence, near-infrared and infrared sensors. We combined digital phenotyping with photosynthetic parameters and soil water potential measurements. Our results show that MIOX4 is able to restore the AsA content of the mutants and the restored lines (vtc+MIOX4) show high AsA, enhanced growth rate, accumulate more biomass, and display healthier chlorophyll fluorescence and water content profiles compared to controls.","Swarnabhasma, an Ayurvedic preparation containing Calotropis gigantea R. Br. (Asclepiadaceae) is extensively used by Ayurvedic physicians for treatment of diabetes mellitus, bronchial asthma, rheumatoid arthritis and nervous disorders. In the present study, we report the effect of chloroform extracts of Calotropis gigantea leaf and flower on free radical scavenging activity, and lipid profile in streptozotozin-induced diabetic rats. The lipid peroxidation, superoxide dismutase, and catalase were measured in liver homogenate and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, lipid profile were measured in blood serum. Administration of single dose of streptozotozin (55 mg/kg, i.p.) caused significant increases in lipid peroxidation, serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, cholesterol and triglyceride levels, while superoxide dismutase and catalase levels were significantly decreased. Further, administration of chloroform extracts of Calotropis gigantea leaf and flower to streptozotocin-induced diabetes rats at a dose of 10, 20 and 50 mg/kg orally for 27 d lead to a significant decrease in lipid peroxidation, serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Consequently, superoxide dismutase and catalase levels were significantly increased. Glibenclamide was used as a positive control (10 mg/kg). It was observed that the effect of chloroform extracts of Calotropis gigantea on alkaline phosphatase, cholesterol, superoxide dismutase, serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, levels are comparable to that of those produced by the positive control. ","Gluconobacter oxydans plays important role in conversion of D-sorbitol to L-sorbose, which is an essential intermediate for industrial-scale production of vitamin C. In the fermentation process, some D-sorbitol could be converted to D-fructose and other byproducts by uncertain dehydrogenases. Genome sequencing has revealed the presence of diverse genes encoding dehydrogenases in G. oxydans. However, the characteristics of most of these dehydrogenases remain unclear. Therefore, analyses of these unknown dehydrogenases could be useful for identifying those related to the production of D-fructose and other byproducts. Accordingly, dehydrogenases in G. oxydans WSH-003, an industrial strain used for vitamin C production, were examined. An NAD-dependent dehydrogenase, which was annotated as xylitol dehydrogenase 2, was identified, codon-optimized, and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells. The enzyme exhibited high preference for NAD+ as the cofactor, while no activity with NADP+, FAD, or PQQ was noted. Although this enzyme presented high similarity with NAD-dependent xylitol dehydrogenase, it showed high activity to catalyze D-sorbitol to D-fructose. Unlike the optimum temperature and pH for most of the known NAD-dependent xylitol dehydrogenases (30\u00b0C\u201340\u00b0C and about 6\u20138, respectively), those for the identified enzyme were 57\u00b0C and 12, respectively. The Km and Vmax of the identified dehydrogenase towards L-sorbitol were 4.92 \u03bcM and 196.08 \u03bcM/min, respectively. Thus, xylitol dehydrogenase 2 can be useful for cofactor NADH regeneration under alkaline conditions or its knockout can improve the conversion ratio of D-sorbitol to L-sorbose.","","A major conceptual gap in taste biology is the lack of a general framework for understanding the evolution of different taste modalities among animal species. We turn to two complementary nutritional frameworks, biological stoichiometry theory and nutritional geometry, to develop hypotheses for the evolution of different taste modalities in animals. We describe how the attractive tastes of Na, Ca, P, N and C containing compounds are consistent with principles of both frameworks based on their shared focus on nutritional imbalances and consumer homeostasis. Specifically, we suggest that the evolution of multiple nutritive taste modalities can be predicted by identifying individual elements that are typically more concentrated in the tissues of animals than plants. Additionally, we discuss how consumer homeostasis can inform our understanding of why some taste compounds (i.e., Na, Ca and P salts) can be either attractive or aversive depending on concentration. We also discuss how these complementary frameworks can help to explain the phylogenetic distribution of different taste modalities and improve our understanding of the mechanisms that lead to loss of taste capabilities in some animal lineages. The ideas presented here will stimulate research that bridges the fields of evolutionary biology, sensory biology and ecology.","The enzymatic steps involved in l-ascorbate biosynthesis in photosynthetic organisms (the Smirnoff-Wheeler, SW pathway) has been well established and here we comprehensively analyze the subcellular localization, potential physical interactions of SW pathway enzymes and assess their role in control of ascorbate synthesis. Transient expression of GFP-fusions in Nicotiana benthamiana and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutants complemented with genomic constructs showed that while GME is cytosolic, VTC1, VTC2, VTC4, and l-GalDH have cytosolic and nuclear localization. While transgenic lines GME-GFP, VTC4-GFP and l-GalDH-GFP driven by their endogenous promoters accumulated the fusion proteins, the functional VTC2-GFP protein is detected at low level using immunoblot in a complemented vtc2 null mutant. This low amount of VTC2 protein and the extensive analyses using multiple combinations of SW enzymes in N. benthamiana supported the role of VTC2 as the main control point of the pathway on ascorbate biosynthesis. Interaction analysis of SW enzymes using yeast two hybrid did not detect the formation of heterodimers, although VTC1, GME and VTC4 formed homodimers. Further coimmunoprecipitation (CoIP) analysis indicted that consecutive SW enzymes, as well as the first and last enzymes (VTC1 and l-GalDH), associate thereby adding a new layer of complexity to ascorbate biosynthesis. Finally, metabolic control analysis incorporating known kinetic characteristics, showed that previously reported feedback repression at the VTC2 step confers a high flux control coefficient and rationalizes why manipulation of other enzymes has little effect on ascorbate concentration.","Selenium (Se) plays an important role in human health. Approximately 80% of the world\u2019s population does not consume enough Se which recommended by WHO (World Health Organization). Wheat is an important staple food and Se source for most people in the world. This article summarizes literatures about Se from 1936 to 2020 to investigate Se in wheat farming soil, wheat, and its derived foods. Se fortification and the recommended Se level in wheat were also discussed. Results showed that Se contents in wheat farming soil, grain, and its derived foods around the world were 3.8\u2013552 (mean, 220.99), 0\u20138,270 (mean, 347.30), and 15\u20132,372 (mean, 211.86) \u03bcg\u00b7kg\u22121, respectively. Adopting suitable agronomic measures could effectively realize Se fortification in wheat. The contents in grain, flour, and its derived foods could be improved from 93.94 to 1,181.92, 73.06 to 1,007.75, and 86.90 to 587.61 \u03bcg\u00b7kg\u22121 in average after leaf Se fertilizer application in the field. There was a significant positive correlation between Se content in farming soil and grain, and it was extremely the same between foliar Se fertilizer concentration rate and grain Se increased rate. The recommended Se fortification level in cultivation of wheat in China, India, and Spain was 18.53\u201323.96, 2.65\u20133.37, and 3.93\u20139.88 g\u00b7hm\u22122 respectively. Milling processing and food type could greatly affect Se content of wheat derived food and should be considered seriously to meet people\u2019s Se requirement by wheat.","An ultraviolet (UV)-absorbing compound of unknown identity is present in the aqueous humor of geese and other birds flying at high altitudes. A goose aqueous humor extract, that was believed to contain the UV protective compound which was designated as \u201ccompound X\u201d, was fractionated and examined using a variety of spectroscopic techniques including LC-MS and high field one- and two dimensional-NMR methods. A series of compounds were identified but none of them appeared to be the UV protective \u201ccompound X\u201d. It may be that the level of the UV protective compound in goose aqueous humor is much less than the compounds identified in our investigation, or it may have been degraded by the isolation and chromatographic purification protocols used in our investigations.","","Spring maize is usually subjected to low-temperature stress during seed germination, which retards seedling growth even if under a suitable temperature. However, the mechanism underlying maize seed germination under low-temperature stress modulating seedling growth after being transferred to normal temperature is still ambiguous. In this study, we used two maize inbred lines with different low-temperature resistance (SM and RM) to investigate the mechanism. The results showed that the SM line had higher lipid peroxidation and lower total antioxidant capacity and germination percentage than the RM line under low-temperature stress, which indicated that the SM line was more vulnerable to low-temperature stress. Further transcriptome analysis revealed that seed germination under low-temperature stress caused down-regulation of photosynthesis related gene ontology (GO) terms in two lines. Moreover, the SM line displayed down-regulation of ribosome and superoxide dismutase (SOD) related genes, whereas genes involved in SOD and vitamin B6 were up-regulated in the RM line. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis revealed that photosynthesis and antioxidant metabolism related pathways played important roles in seed germination in response to low-temperature stress, and the photosynthetic system displayed a higher damage degree in the SM line. Both qRT-PCR and physiological characteristics experiments showed similar results with transcriptome data. Taken together, we propose a model for maize seed germination in response to low-temperature stress.","L-ascorbic acid, commonly known as vitamin C, is a ubiquitous 6-carbon carbohydrate characterized by its ability to scavenge free radicals. In enteric bacteria, L-ascorbate can be utilized as a nutrient using the UlaABCDEF and UlaG-UlaRpathway under anaerobic conditions. In this study, we identified homologs of the Ula system within Vibrio cholerae and showed that V. cholerae is able to utilize L-ascorbate as an energy source. Growth pattern assays of a ulaG in-frame deletion mutant demonstrated that ulaG is essential for L-ascorbate fermentation. Expression analysis showed that ula catabolism and transport genes were significantly induced in cells grown in the presence of L-ascorbate compared to glucose and these genes were also highly induced during growth on intestinal mucus. In in vitro growth competition assays, the ulaG mutant was outcompeted by wild type when grown in intestinal mucus suggesting the Ula system could be important for fitness. Within the ula operon in V. cholerae and all Vibrio species a homology of ORF VCA0243 is present that encodes a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) phosphatase. This enzyme in E. coli, converts the active form of vitamin B6 PLP to its inactive form pyridoxal (PL). In V. splendidus and related species, the aerobic and anaerobic L-ascorbate pathway genes cluster together and both systems contain a PLP phosphatase. An in-frame deletion mutant of vca0243 resulted in a growth defect in L-ascorbate fermentation as well as additional carbon and amino acid sources indicating a role in cellular metabolism. Phylogenetic analysis of UlaG and UlaD suggested the region was acquired by horizontal gene transfer.","Although visual processing impairments have been explored in schizophrenia (SZ), their underlying neurobiology of the visual processing impairments has not been widely studied. Also, while some research has hinted at differences in information transfer and flow in SZ, there are few investigations of the dynamics of functional connectivity within visual networks. In this study, we analyzed resting-state fMRI data of the visual sensory network (VSN) in 160 healthy control (HC) subjects and 151 SZ subjects. We estimated 9 independent components within the VSN. Then, we calculated the dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) using the Pearson correlation. Next, using k-means clustering, we partitioned the dFNCs into five distinct states, and then we calculated the portion of time each subject spent in each state, that we termed the occupancy rate (OCR). Using OCR, we compared HC with SZ subjects and investigated the link between OCR and visual learning in SZ subjects. Besides, we compared the VSN functional connectivity of SZ and HC subjects in each state. We found that this network is indeed highly dynamic. Each state represents a unique connectivity pattern of fluctuations in VSN FNC, and all states showed significant disruption in SZ. Overall, HC showed stronger connectivity within the VSN in states. SZ subjects spent more time in a state in which the connectivity between the middle temporal gyrus and other regions of VNS is highly negative. Besides, OCR in a state with strong positive connectivity between middle temporal gyrus and other regions correlated significantly with visual learning scores in SZ.","Morphotypes of Brassica oleracea are the result of a dynamic interaction between genes that regulate the transition between vegetative and reproductive stages and those that regulate leaf morphology and plant architecture. In kales ornate leaves, delayed flowering, and nutritional quality are some of the characters potentially selected by humans during domestication.","In a social context of increasingly concern about healthy diets, the development of new varieties with enhanced content in nutraceutical compounds is an increasingly important objective of the fruit breeding programs currently developed. In this sense, apricot is a fruit crop very appreciated by consumers due to its organoleptic characteristics, but also plays an important role in human nutrition due to its contain of phytocompounds as sugars, organic acids, vitamins and polyphenols. In this work, new selections from the apricot breeding program carried out at the Instituto Valenciano de Investigaciones Agrarias (IVIA) and traditional varieties have been analysed aimed at identifying sources of genetic variation for fruit quality. For this purpose, sugar content, organic acids and ascorbic acid were studied during two crop years. Results revealed sucrose and glucose as the major sugars, malic and citric acid as the main organic acids, and diverse ascorbic acid content among the cultivars studied. Results obtained pointed some accessions as potential sources to increase fruit quality. In addition, the study showed that apricot peel is an excellent source of nutraceutical compounds. Moreover, this study opens up new possibilities for future work to study the genetic control of these traits in apricot.","Objective Cyanide is a highly toxic compound, and the consumption of products containing cyanide is of singificant public health concern. In contrast, \u03b2-carotene possesses essential nutritional attributes related to human health, therefore the characterisation and quanfication of both compounds in food products is both fundamental and necessary. This investigation sought to identify the cyanide and \u03b2-carotene levels in two flours produced from the roots of two varieties of cassava (Manihot esculenta crantz), namely UMUCASS-38 (TMS 01/1371) and NR 8082, and their associated food products.","Change in climate of the entire globe due to elevated temperature and minimum annual rainfall in barren zone frequently leads to salinity of soil. The current study was aimed to evaluate the importance of sugar beet extract (SBE) as a bio-stimulant to improve the adverse damages of induced salinity stress (40mM) on growth, oosmolytes and antioxidant defense system of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). Pot experiment was carried in green house under different concentrations of SBE (10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%) pre-soaked seeds of Hordeum vulgare for 5 hours SBE was analyzed for glycine betaine (100mmol/kg), betalains (1.3mg/l), phenolics (1.30g/100ml), flavonoids (0.59mg/ml), carotenoids (0.23ml/100ml), vitamin E (0.002%), vitamin C (8.04g/100ml), sugar (8g/100ml), protein (1.39mg/100ml), and oxalic acid (38mg/100ml) while Ca (13.72mg/l), Mg (7.121 mg/l) and K (11.45mg/l) contents were also determined. We found significant improvement in germination parameters of Hordeum vulgare L. via SB extract on coefficient of velocity of emergence (CVE), mean emergence time (MET), germination energy (GE), timson germination index (TGI), germination rate index (GRI) and time to 50% emergence (E50) under induced salinity stress. However, photosynthetic pigments, e.g., chlorophyll and carotenoids were enhanced using 40% SB extract, soluble sugar, protein, proline, POD, MDA with 50% SB extract while SOD and H2O2 in 20% SBE, respectively. Our findings suggested that SB extract promotes both agronomical and physiological attributes, is a positive way to enhance our economy by increasing crop yields in arid and semi-arid areas along with plant tolerance to under induced salinity stress.","The cultivation of Theobroma grandiflorum in the Brazilian Amazon is mainly conducted by family farmers who use a range of different management strategies. Thus, breeding programs of the species must address the challenge of developing cultivars that are adapted to and stable in a variety of cultivation environments. In this context, this study aimed to estimate the optimum number of harvests for genetic selection of T. grandiflorum progenies and identify the most promising ones in terms of productivity, stability, and adaptability. The trials were implemented in three environments, using a randomized complete block design, with 25 full-sib progenies, five replications, and three plants per plot. The traits mean number of fruits/plant, mean fruit production/plant, and rate of infection with witches\u2019 broom (Moniliophthora perniciosa) were evaluated over 11 harvests. The Restricted Maximum Likelihood/Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (REML/BLUP) mixed model method was used to estimate genetic parameters and predict genetic values, which were then applied to assess stability and adaptability. The results show that there is genetic variability among the studied T. grandiflorum progenies and that accurate genetic selection aiming at recombination is effective after three harvests, for recombination, or eleven harvests for identification of recommended progenies. Six progenies were selected that met the requirements for productivity, stability, and adaptability to different cultivation environments. These results can be used to optimize and advance T. grandiflorum breeding programs.","Peptic ulcer disease affects many people globally. With the increasing resistance to some orthodox antibiotics such as Clarithromycin and Metronidazole, it is important that new acceptable, safer and effective therapies are developed to manage this disease. Various herbal medicines have been used traditionally for the remedy of peptic ulcer disease (PUD), however scientific information with regards to their anti-peptic ulcer both in-vivo and in-vitro as well as clinical studies supporting their use is still inadequate. The Centre for Plant Medicine Research, (CPMR) Mampong-Akuapem, Ghana manufactures three herbal Products namely Enterica, Dyspepsia and NPK 500 capsules which are currently used for the remedy of PUD as a triple therapy at its out-patient clinic with promising effects. The aim of this review is to gather information from literature on the anti-ulcer properties, pharmacological, phytochemical constituents and related activities of herbal plants used at the CPMR for formulation of the triple herbal therapy. This review may, provide some scientific bases for the use of Enterica, Dyspepsia and NPK 500 capsules in the management of Peptic ulcer at the CPMR out-patient clinic. Methods Organization for the review involved the on and/or offline search for information from available literature using electronic data and scientific research information resources such as PubMed, Science Direct and Google scholar. Results In this review, fifteen ethno-medicinal plants used for the formulation of Enterica, Dyspepsia and NPK capsules have been discussed, presenting the description of the plants, composition and pharmacological activity. Interpretation Tables with the summary of reviewed medicinal plants with their anti-ulcer models and inference on possible mechanisms of action were drawn up.

","In this study, Lentinus edodes (or mushroom) powder and carrot juice were used as raw materials to prepare a new type of nutritious cakes. Microencapsulation was applied in embedding vitamin C to prevent the loss of this vitamin during baking at high temperatures. The most suitable addition amount of each materials was optimized via single-factor test and response surface analysis. The optimal microencapsulation of shiitake mushroom powder with carrot juice required 10 g of mushroom powder, 35 g of soft sugar, 50 mL of carrot juice and 160 g of egg white. The cake prepared herein was rich in nutrient and exuded a unique flavor. This cake was prepared via modern processing technologies and efficient detection techniques. Microencapsulation not only improves the nutritional value of traditional flour products but also expands the scope of research on food processing technologies.","The earth has become increasingly overcrowded as a result of rapid urbanization and population growth, predicting that its carrying capacity could be overstretched. As a result, it is important to test the possibilities of growing plants under space exploration conditions, especially gravitational balance. Since microgravity impedes plant development, to what extent can plant growth stimulators reverse or enhance this trend? A total of 12 maize seeds were weighed and placed sideways in petri dish and inoculated with plant growth stimulators such as indole acetic acid (IAA), gibberellic acid (GA), and ascorbate (AA) and the clinorotated at different rates (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 rpm), while control seeds were just placed on a table. Results showed that at 72 hrs, the maize seeds under microgravity showed reduced germination percentage with increasing clinorotation rates as against the control. But when stimulated with IAA, GA and AA, improved germination percentage was observed as against the control even under microgravity condition. The seedling dry weight, germination time and other germination parameters also showed similar improvements. Comparatively, the three growth stimulators showed no major variations in their ability to improve germination percentage under microgravitational impact. However, IAA showed more improvement on seedling vigor as against others, while GA showed more effect on the peak time and rate of germination. This research confirmed the possibilities of improving germinability of maize seeds under space exploration condition.","Simple Summary In recent years, interest has grown in improving the productivity of pure local breeds in Spain using corn silage as an alternative to concentrates. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the lipid oxidation, color and visual color acceptability of meat from the Avilena-Negra Iberica breed fed with corn silage in total mixed ration. The inclusion of corn silage led to lower lipid oxidation and higher visual color acceptability when the samples were packaged in a modified atmosphere. The use of corn silage could serve as a feeding option for this type of animal without affecting the quality of the derived meat. Abstract In order to increase the economic profitability of Avilena-Negra Iberica beef production, the inclusion of corn silage in total mixed rations was proposed during the fattening period. Twenty-four Avilena-Negra Iberica breed entire young bulls were used to evaluate the effects of two feeding systems--concentrate (CON) and corn silage (SIL)--and two packaging systems--vacuum (VAC) and modified atmosphere (MAP)--on the lipid oxidation, color evolution and visual color acceptability of meat throughout display with either oxygen-permeable film (FILM) or modified atmosphere (MAP). Two muscles were assessed: Longissimus thoracis (LT) and Semitendinosus (ST). Meat from SIL-fed animals had higher TBA values than CON-fed animals after 7 days in MAP packaging. Lipid oxidation was prevented more effectively by VAC packaging than MAP. Display time highly influenced lipid oxidation, since oxidation rates were lower with VAC than MAP packaging. After 14 days of display in MAP, the LT from CON was lighter than the ST. Meat discoloration after 7 days of display was significantly different between packaging systems. Vacuum-packaged meat kept the same color throughout the storage time. Visual color acceptability for the LT was higher throughout display than for the ST. Samples from the MAP were well accepted by consumers, especially the meat from the SIL group. Alternatively, feeding with corn silage could be used for this type of animals without affecting important aspects of meat quality. ","","","Background Selenium forms a significant component of seleno-proteins in the body. Seleno-methionine is integrated into proteins instead of methionine and acts as a storage pool. In proteins, the active form of Selenium is seleno-cysteine.in this review we aim to prevail the results of selenium effect on thyroid status in recent clinical trials. The systemic review aims to find out the correlation between supplementation of Selenium and anti-TPO antibodies and T4 levels in Hashimoto\u2019s Thyroiditis. Selenium supplementation decreases the level of anti-TPO antibodies. The supplementation of Selenium increases the level of T4 levels.","","Plant-beneficial microorganisms are gaining importance for sustainable plant production and phytosanitary practices. Yet there is a lack of computational approaches targeting bacterial traits associated with plant growth-promotion (PGP), which hinders the in-silico identification, comparison, and selection of phytostimulatory bacterial strains. To address this problem, we have developed the new web resource PLaBAse (v1.01, http://plabase.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/pb/plabase.php), which provides a number of services, including (i) a database for screening 5,565 plant-associated bacteria (PLaBA-db), (ii) a tool for predicting plant growth-promoting traits (PGPTs) of single bacterial genomes (PGPT-Pred), and (iii) a tool for the prediction of bacterial plant-association by marker gene identification (PIFAR-Pred). The latter was developed by Mart\u00ednez-Garc\u00eda et al. and is now hosted at University of Tuebingen. The PGPT-Pred tool is based on our new PGPT ontology, a literature- and OMICs-curated, comprehensive, and hierarchical collection of \u223c6,900 PGPTs that are associated with 6,965,955 protein sequences. To study the distribution of the PGPTs across different environments, we applied it to 70,540 bacterial strains associated with (i) seven different environments (including plants), (iii) five different plant spheres (organs), and (iii) two bacteria-induced plant phenotypes. This analysis revealed that plant-symbiotic bacteria generally have a larger genome size and a higher count of PGPT-annotated protein encoding genes. Obviously, not all reported PGPTs are restricted to -or only enriched in-plant-associated and plant symbiotic bacteria. Some also occur in human- and animal-associated bacteria, perhaps due to the transmission of PGP bacteria (PGPBs) between environments, or because some functions are involved in adaption processes to various environments. Here we provide an easy-to-use approach for screening of PGPTs in bacterial genomes across various phyla and isolation sites, using PLaBA-db, and for standardized annotation, using PGPT-Pred. We believe that this resource will improve our understanding about the entire PGP processes and facilitate the prediction of PGPB as bio-inoculants and for biosafety strategies, so as to help to establish sustainable and targeted bacteria-incorporated plant production systems in the future.","To reduce postharvest losses of Ponkan mandarins caused by outdated storage facilities and preservation technology, we evaluated the preservation effect of different storage temperatures on Ponkan mandarins (5 \u00b11, 10 \u00b1 1, 15 \u00b1 1, and 20 \u00b11 \u00b0C), and obtained a comprehensive score using principal component analysis (PCA) to determine its suitable storage temperature. The results indicate that, relative to the other three storage temperatures, storage at 10 \u00b0C significantly maintains high total soluble solid content, titratable acid, and vitamin C contents; the accumulation of malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) content decreased and changes in the relative conductivity (REC) were suppressed; and high activities of superoxide-dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX), as well as high contents of total phenol and total flavonoid were maintained. The PCA and clustering heat map results show that that the comprehensive score was the highest when stored at 10 \u00b0C. The data indicate that the suitable storage temperature of Ponkan mandarins at 10 \u00b0C significantly decreased MDA accumulation and reactive oxygen species metabolism, maintains high antioxidant capacity, maintains good fruit quality and achieves good storage and preservation effect, which is the appropriate storage temperature for Ponkan mandarins.","Maize belongs to tropical environment and is extremely sensitive to drought and chilling stress, particularly at early developmental stages. The present study investigated the individual and combine effects of drought (15% PEG-Solution) and chilling stress (15\u00b0C/12\u00b0C) on the morpho-physiological growth, osmolyte accumulation, production and regulations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the activities of antioxidants in two maize hybrids i.e., \u2018XD889\u2019 and \u2018XD319\u2019 and two inbred cultivars i.e., \u2018Yu13\u2019 and \u2018Yu37\u2019. Individual and combined drought and chilling stresses stimulated the production of O2\u25a1, H2O2, OH\u25a1 and enhanced malondialdehyde (MDA) contents which led to reduced photosynthetic pigments and morphological growth. Drought, chilling and drought + chilling stress conditions induced the compatible osmolytes, ROS detoxifying proteins and antioxidants to counterbalanced the oxidative damage. It was found that the concurrent occurrence of drought + chilling stress was more lethal for maize seedling growth than the drought and chilling individual stresses. However, the performance of hybrid maize cultivars (XD889 and XD319) was better than the inbred maize cultivars (Yu13 and Yu37). For improving tolerance to individual and concurrent drought and chilling stress in maize, future research focus should be on developing genetically engineer plants that have the ability to generate specific response against sub-optimal temperature and water deficit conditions.","Myo-inositol oxygenase (MIOX) is the first enzyme in the inositol route to ascorbate (L-ascorbic acid, AsA, vitamin C). We have previously shown that Arabidopsis plants constitutively expressing MIOX have elevated foliar AsA content and displayed enhanced growth rate, biomass accumulation, and increased tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses. In this work, we used a combination of transcriptomics, chromatography, microscopy, and physiological measurements to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms mediating the phenotype of the AtMIOX4 line. Transcritpomic analysis revealed increased expression of genes involved in auxin synthesis, hydrolysis, transport, and metabolism, which are supported by elevated auxin levels both in vitro and in vivo, and confirmed by assays demonstrating their effect on epidermal cell elongation in the AtMIOX4 over-expresser plants. Additionally, we detected up-regulation of transcripts involved in photosynthesis that was validated by increased efficiency of the photosystem II and proton motive force. We also found increased expression of amylase leading to higher intracellular glucose levels. Multiple gene families conferring plants tolerance to cold, water limitation, and heat stresses were found to be elevated in the AtMIOX4 line. Interestingly, the high AsA plants also displayed up-regulation of transcripts and hormones involved in defense including jasmonates, defensin, glucosinolates, and transcription factors that are known to be important for biotic stress tolerance. These results overall indicate that elevated levels of auxin and glucose, and enhanced photosynthetic efficiency in combination with up-regulation of abiotic stresses response genes underly the higher growth rate and abiotic stresses tolerance phenotype of the AtMIOX4 over-expressers.","Resume Les patients ayant eu des formes severes de COVID-19 ont pose des problemes nutritionnels en reanimation. L'immobilisation prolongee en reanimation, associee a une reaction inflammatoire systemique exacerbee, a ete a l'origine d'une faiblesse et d'une fatigue musculaire. Pour pallier ce probleme, l'instauration d'une nutrition enterale precoce est recommandee, pour atteindre progressivement la cible energetique de 25 kcal/kg/jour et proteique de 1,3 g/kg/jour en 4 jours environ. La survenue d'un syndrome de renutrition inappropriee doit etre surveillee. En cas d'intolerance digestive refractaire a un traitement prokinetique, une nutrition parenterale complementaire ou totale est indiquee, en favorisant les emulsions lipidiques mixtes (contenant de l'huile de poisson) de nouvelle generation et en surveillant regulierement la triglyceridemie. La prise en charge nutritionnelle des patients doit se faire en limitant les procedures a risque de contamination pour le personnel soignant. ","Leptospira genus contains species that affect human health with varying degrees of pathogenicity. In this context, we aimed to evaluate the differences in modulation of host gene expression by strains of Leptospira with varied virulence degrees. Our data showed a high number of differentilly expressed transcripts in murine macrophages following 6h of infection with both virulent and culture-attenuated L. interrogans and to a lesser degree, with the saprophyte strain L. biflexa. That suggests that certain genes are modulated by Leptospira infection independent of their degree of virulence, whether others are virulence and species associated. Pathway analysis indicated that Apoptosis, ATM Signaling and Cell Cycle: G2/M DNA Damage Checkpoint Regulation were exclusively regulated following infection with the virulent strain. Results demonstrated that species and virulence play a role during host response to Leptosppira spp in murine macrophages.","The use of natural antioxidants, in particular polyphenols such as dihydroquercetin (DHQ), in animal nutrition have recently increased in popularity. This may partly be due to the risk of increased incidences of heat stress associated with raising livestock in warmer ambient temperatures, facilitated by global warming, reducing antioxidant capacity. The current research demonstrates the effect of dietary DHQ, vitamin E and standard or high ambient temperatures on growth performance, energy and nutrient metabolism, gastrointestinal tract development (GIT), jejunal villus morphometry and antioxidant status in broiler chickens. Each of the four experimental diets were fed to 16 pens of five birds, which were allocated to four rooms (four pens in each room). The temperature in two rooms was maintained at a constant 35 \u00b0C (high temperature; HT), and the temperature in the other two rooms was gradually reduced from 27 \u00b0C at 7d of age to 22 \u00b0C at 20d of age (standard temperature; ST). Rearing birds at HT reduced: feed intake, weight gain, weight of small intestine, total GIT, liver, spleen, heart, villus height, villus surface area and lowered blood glutationperoxidase (GSH-Px). Dietary DHQ increased blood GSH-Px and total antioxidant status, increased heart weight and reduced caecal size. When fed separately, DHQ and vitamin E improved hepatic vitamin E concentration. Feeding vitamin E increased spleen and liver weights. When fed together, DHQ and vitamin E reduced villus height, villus height to crypt depth ratio and villus surface area. Temperature and antioxidants did not affect energy and nutrient metabolism. There were no effects of dietary antioxidants on growth performance of broiler chickens and there were no mortalities. At present it is unclear if feeding antioxidants (in particular DHQ) at different levels, using different dietary formulations, and rearing birds under a range of environmental conditions may be effective at enhancing production performance and bird health in hot ambient climates.","Capirona (Calycophyllum spruceanum (Benth.) K. Schum.) and Bolaina (Guazuma crinita Lam.) are fast-growing Amazonian trees with increasing demand in timber industry. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the content of cellulose, hemicellulose, holocellulose and lignin in juvenile tress to accelerate forest breeding programs. The aim of this study was to identify chemical differences between apical and basal stem of Capirona and Bolaina to develop models for estimating the chemical composition using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra. FTIR-ATR spectra were obtained from 150 samples for each specie that were 1.8 year-old. The results showed significant differences between the apical and basal stem for each species in terms of cellulose, hemicellulose, holocellulose and lignin content. This variability was useful to build partial least squares (PLS) models from the FTIR spectra and they were evaluated by root mean squared error of predictions (RMSEP) and ratio of performance to deviation (RPD). Lignin content was efficiently predicted in Capirona (RMSEP = 0.48, RPD &gt; 2) and Bolaina (RMSEP = 0.81, RPD &gt; 2). In Capirona, the predictive power of cellulose, hemicellulose and holocellulose models (0.68 &lt; RMSEP &lt; 2.06, 1.60 &lt; RPD &lt; 1.96) were high enough to predict wood chemical composition. In Bolaina, model for cellulose attained an excellent predictive power (RMSEP = 1.82, RPD = 6.14) while models for hemicellulose and holocellulose attained a good predictive power (RPD &gt; 2.0). This study showed that FTIR-ATR together with PLS is a reliable method to determine the wood chemical composition in juvenile trees of Capirona and Bolaina.","Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent and aggressive adult primary cancer in the central nervous system (CNS). Therapeutic approaches for glioblastoma are under intense investigation, such as the emerging immunotherapy, but so far only marginal progress has been made due to the heterogeneity and highly invasive nature of glioblastoma. Here, we propose an alternative approach to tackle GBM through reprogramming proliferative GBM cells into non-proliferative neurons. We report efficient neuronal conversion from human GBM cells by overexpressing single neural transcription factor Neurogenic differentiation 1 (NeuroD1), Neurogenin-2 (Neurog2) or Achaete-scute homolog 1 (Ascl1). Subtype characterization reveals that the majority of Neurog2- and NeuroD1-converted neurons are glutamatergic, while Ascl1 favors GABAergic neuron generation. The GBM cell-converted neurons not only express pan-neuronal markers, such as NeuN and MAP2, but also exhibit neuron-specific electrophysiological activities. We further conducted transcriptome analyses to investigate the underlying cell conversion mechanism. Our RNA-seq analyses discover that neuronal genes are activated among glioma cells after overexpression of neural transcription factors, and different signaling pathways are activated by different neural transcription factors. Importantly, the neuronal conversion of GBM cells is accompanied by significant inhibition of GBM cell proliferation in both in vitro and in vivo models. Therefore, these results suggest that GBM cells can be reprogrammed into different subtypes of neurons, leading to a potential alternative approach to treat brain tumor.","Behavioral genetics and cultural evolution have both revolutionized our understanding of human behavior, but largely independently of each other. Here we reconcile these two fields using a dual inheritance approach, which offers a more nuanced understanding of the interaction between genes and culture, and a resolution to several long-standing puzzles. For example, by neglecting how human environments are extensively shaped by cultural dynamics, behavioral genetic approaches systematically inflate heritability estimates and thereby overestimate the genetic basis of human behavior. A WEIRD (Western, educated, industrialized, rich, democratic) gene problem obscures this inflation. Considering both genetic and cultural evolutionary forces, heritability scores become less a property of a trait and more a moving target that responds to cultural and social changes. Ignoring cultural evolutionary forces leads to an over-simplified model of gene-to-phenotype causality. When cumulative culture functionally overlaps with genes, genetic effects become masked, or even reversed, and the causal effect of an identified gene is confounded with features of the cultural environment, specific to a particular society at a particular time. This framework helps explain why it is easier to discover genes for deficiencies than genes for abilities. With this framework, we predict the ways in which heritability should differ between societies, between socioeconomic levels within some societies but not others, and over the life course. An integrated cultural evolutionary behavioral genetics cuts through the nature\u2013nurture debate and elucidates controversial topics such as general intelligence.","Use of organic manures to meet the nutrient requirement of crop would be an inevitable practice in the years to come for sustainable agriculture since organic manures generally improve the soil physical, chemical and biological properties. Hence, field experiments were carried out in 2017 and 2018 to compare the impact of different organic manures and NPK fertilizer on soil properties, growth, yield, proximate and mineral contents of okra (Abelmoschus esculentus L.). The treatments each year 2017 and 2018 consisted of: rabbit manure, cow dung, poultry manure, green manure [Mexican sunflower (Tithonia diversifolia Asteraceae)], pig manure, NPK 15-15-15 fertilizer applied at 120 kg N ha\u22121 and a control (no manure/ inorganic fertilizer). The seven treatments were laid out in a randomized complete block design with three replication. Organic manures and NPK fertilizer increased the soil organic matter (OM), N, P, K, Ca and Mg (NPK fertilizer did not increase OM, Ca and Mg significantly), growth, yield, minerals, protein, ash, carbohydrate and mucilage contents of okra fruit as compared with control. Organic manures improved okra yield compared with NPK fertilizer. Okra growth and yield parameters were significantly higher in 2018 compared with 2017. Control, rabbit manure, cow dung, poultry manure, green manure, pig manure and NPK fertilizer in 2018 increased the pod yield of okra by 9.7%, 35.3%, 57.9%, 36.2%, 39.2%, 45.5% and 3.2%, respectively compare with the same treatment in 2017. Amongst various organic manures, poultry manure produced significantly higher plant growth, yield, mineral and proximate composition of okra because of its high soil chemical properties which could be related to its lowest C: N ratio, lignin and lignin: N ratio. Results also showed that okra grown during high intensity rainfall has higher yield but with reduced quality except its mucilage content. Therefore, planting of okra with poultry manure under moderate rainfall will enhance the health benefit from the fruit, however, those that desire its mucilage content planting during high rainfall is recommended.","Understanding the evolution of deleterious mutations through domestication has fascinated evolutionary biologists and breeders alike. Some domesticated organisms have been reported to accumulate deleterious mutations, i.e. radical amino acid changes, through their domestication history (\u201ccost of domestication\u201d). However, more recent evidence paints a more complex picture of this phenomenon in different domesticated organisms. In this study, we used genomic sequences of 253 tomato accessions to investigate the evolution of deleterious mutations and genomic structural variants (SVs) through tomato domestication history. Specifically, we used phylogeny-based methods to identify deleterious mutations in the cultivated tomato as well as its closely related semi-wild and wild populations. We also explored a potential correlation between deleterious mutations and SVs. To create a functional link between deleterious alleles and phenotypes of interest for tomato breeding, we also conducted Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS) on several fruit volatiles.","Tomatoes are known for their human health benefits. Tomato producers use chemical fertilizers to increase tomato production levels. However, the use of organic fertilizers such as digestate can achieve satisfactory yields while sustaining the soil environment. In this tomato study, the effect of three dilutions of digestate (25%, 50% and 75%) on plant height, leaf area and fruit number were compared to NPK 15 15 15. The 50% dilution of digestate had the most beneficial effect on the plants at the end of the experiment.","","","Hypochlorous acid (HOCl), a powerful antimicrobial oxidant, is produced by neutrophils to fight infections. Here we show that N-chlorination, induced by HOCl concentrations encountered at sites of inflammation, converts blood plasma proteins into chaperone-like holdases that protect other proteins from aggregation. This chaperone-like conversion was reversible by antioxidants and was abrogated by prior methylation of basic amino acids. Furthermore, reversible N-chlorination of basic amino acid side chains is the major factor that converts plasma proteins into efficient activators of immune cells. Finally, HOCl-modified serum albumin was found to act as a pro-survival molecule that protects neutrophils from cell death induced by highly immunogenic foreign antigens. We propose that activation and enhanced persistence of neutrophils mediated by HOCl-modified plasma proteins, resulting in the increased and prolonged generation of ROS, including HOCl, constitutes a potentially detrimental positive feedback loop that can only be attenuated through the reversible nature of the modification involved.","Genomes hold a treasure trove of protein fossils: fragments of formerly protein-coding DNA, which mainly come from transposable elements (TEs) or host genes. These fossils reveal ancient evolution of TEs and genomes, and many fossils have been exapted to perform diverse functions important for the host\u2019s fitness. However, old and highly-degraded fossils are hard to identify, standard methods (e.g. BLAST) are not optimized for this task, and few Paleozoic protein fossils have been found.","","Background There is no definitive cure for asthma; as such, prevention remains a major goal. Decision-analytic models are routinely used to evaluate the value-for-money proposition of interventions. Following best practice standards in decision-analytic modeling, the objective of this study was to solicit expert opinion to develop a concept map for a policy model for primary prevention of asthma.","","Rubus corchorifolius (\u2018Shanmei\u2019 or mountain berry, 2n =14) is widely distributed in China, and its fruit has high nutritional and medicinal values. Here, we report a high-quality chromosome-scale genome assembly of Shanmei, with a size of 215.69 Mb and encompassing 26,696 genes. Genome comparisons among Rosaceae species show that Shanmei and Fupenzi (Rubus chingii Hu) are most closely related, and then is blackberry (Rubus occidentalis). Further resequencing of 101 samples of Shanmei collected from four regions in provinces of Yunnan, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Sichuan in South China reveals that the Hunan population of Shanmei possesses the highest diversity and may represent the relatively more ancestral population. Moreover, the Yunnan population undergoes strong selection based on nucleotide diversity, linkage disequilibrium, and the historical effective population size analyses. Furthermore, genes from candidate genomic regions that show strong divergence are significantly enriched in flavonoid biosynthesis and plant hormone signal transduction, indicating the genetic basis of adaptation of Shanmei to the local environments. The high-quality genome sequences and the variome dataset of Shanmei provide valuable resources for breeding applications and for elucidating the genome evolution and ecological adaptation of Rubus species.","The aim of this study is to explore the optimal N, P and K fertilization model suitable for pear-jujube in the mountain of northern Shaanxi in 2016 years. This experiment use 3-factor, saturated optimal design for quadratic fertilization scheme. The effects of different fertilization treatments on the yield and quality of pear-jujube were studied through field experiments. And comprehensive evaluation based on the quality of pear-jujube. The results showed that N1P3K3 has the highest yield, which is 48% higher than the control (CK). The effect of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium on yield is potassium fertilizer (positive effect)&gt; phosphate fertilizer (positive effect)&gt; nitrogen fertilizer (negative effect). Phosphate and potassium fertilizers have significant effects on increasing the content of soluble solids. Application of potassium fertilizer alone can significantly increase the content of reduced Vitamins c. The combined application of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium reduced the content of reduced Vitamins c. N3P3K1 treatment can significantly increase the total sugar content in fruits. Single application of phosphate and potassium increases the content of organic acids in fruits. Other fertilization treatments have significant effects on reducing the content of organic acids in fruits. The sugar-acid ratio of N3P3K1 is significantly higher than CK, which had an important effect on improving the taste. A high amount of potassium fertilizer has a significant effect on increasing the total flavonoid content in fruits. The interaction of nitrogen and phosphorus will reduce the total flavonoid content. The effect of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium on quality is potassium (positive effect)&gt; nitrogen (positive effect)&gt; phosphate (positive effect). Comprehensive analysis, the optimal fertilization amount when the target yield is 23000 \u223c 27000 kg\u00b7hm-2 and the quality score is above 85 is nitrogen (N) 406.93 \u223c 499.31 kg\u00b7hm-2, phosphorus (P2O5) 203.94 \u223c 297.08 kg\u00b7hm-2, and potassium (K2O) 285.47 \u223c 322.82 kg\u00b7hm-2.","Background Mine tailings contain rare earth elements, including lanthanum and cerium, and plant micronutrients including iron. Previous studies have demonstrated that fertilizers containing rare earth elements and/or micronutrients can influence plant physiology, nutrient uptake and crop yield. However, applying the right dose of these fertilizers is critical since the concentration range associated with benefits is often narrow, and overapplication can lead to crop yield reductions. This study aimed to quantify the effects of a water-soluble fertilizer, REAP, on the yield of greenhouse crops.","Freeze tolerance is an amazing overwintering strategy that enables ectotherms to occupy new niches and survive in cold climates. However, the genetic basis underpinning this ecologically relevant adaptation is largely unknown. Amur sleeper is the only known freeze-tolerant fish species that can overwinter with its entire body frozen in ice. Here, we sequenced the chromosome-level genome of the Amur sleeper and performed comparative genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic analyses to investigate this remarkable adaptation. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the Amur sleeper diverged from its close relative with no cold hardiness about 15.07 million years ago and revealed two unusual population expansions during the glacial epochs. Integrative omics data identified a synchronous regulation of genes and metabolites involved in hypometabolism and cellular stress response, and several related genes showed strong evidence of accelerated evolution and positive selection. Potential evolutionary innovations that might aid in freezing survival were found to be associated with the dynamic rearrangement of the cytoskeleton to maintain cell viability, redistribution of water and cryoprotectants to limit cell volume reduction, and inhibition in nerve activity to facilitate dormancy, demonstrating a coordinated evolution for this complex adaptation. Overall, our work provides valuable resources and opportunities to unveil the genetic basis of freeze tolerance adaptation in ectothermic vertebrates.","DNA methylation of cytosines at CpG dinucleotides is a widespread epigenetic mark that is responsive to environmental exposures and associated with a wide range of human pathologies. However, compared to genetic variation, genome wide epigenetic variation has been relatively unexplored due to the limited representation of variable CpGs on commercial high throughput platforms. To address this gap, we developed a pipeline to identify high value asthma and allergy associated CpGs among the &gt;28 million CpG sites in the human genome. We focused on epithelial cells: sentinels in the airway that respond to inhaled microbes, pollution and allergens and mediate their downstream effects on asthma and allergic disease risk. We combined whole genome bisulfite sequencing in these cells from children with and without allergic asthma and in silico evidence of functionality to identify high value CpGs for a custom DNA methylation array. Compared to commercial arrays, the Asthma&amp;Allergy Custom array was enriched for CpGs with intermediate methylation levels, which are more likely to be correlated with the expression of their nearest or target genes and associated with allergic sensitization in children of diverse ancestries compared to CpGs on the commercial array. Our study revealed signature features of functional CpGs and unveiled a wealth of DNA methylation variation at functional CpG sites that are missed by existing high throughput arrays, indicating that inter individual variation in DNA methylation may contribute more to disease risk than previously appreciated."],"title":["The potential impact of nutritional intake on symptoms severity in patients with comorbid migraine and irritable bowel syndrome","Clinical Trial of Efficacy and Toxicity of Disoproxil Tenofovir Fumarate and Emtricitabine for Mild to Moderate SARS-CoV-2 Infections","The hippocampus and neocortical inhibitory engrams protect against memory interference","Investigating Causal Associations of Diet-Derived Circulating Antioxidants with Risk of Six Major Mental Disorders: A Mendelian Randomization Study","Vitamin B12 and Risk of Diabetes: New insight from Cross-Sectional and Longitudinal Analyses of the China Stroke Primary Prevention Trial (CSPPT)","Targeting TGF-\u03b2 pathway with COVID-19 Drug Candidate ARTIVeda/PulmoHeal Accelerates Recovery from Mild-Moderate COVID-19","A dual mechanism of enhancer activation by FOXA pioneer factors induces endodermal organ fates","Correlation of D-xylose with severity and morbidity-related factors of COVID-19 and possible therapeutic use of D-xylose and antibiotics for COVID-19","Omics profiling identifies MAPK/ERK pathway as a gatekeeper of nephron progenitor metabolism","The impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on university students\u2019 dietary intake, physical activity, and sedentary behaviour","An open-label prospective observational study of antiandrogen and non-antiandrogen early pharmacological approaches in females with mild-to-moderate COVID-19.

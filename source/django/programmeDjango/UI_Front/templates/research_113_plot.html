They are caused by inherited or de novo mutations in over 350 nuclear-encoded and mtDNA-encoded genes. There is no approved treatment to stop the progression of any mitochondrial disease despite the enormous global unmet need. Affected families often self-compound cocktails of over-the-counter vitamins and generally recognized as safe nutritional supplements that have not received regulatory approval for efficacy. Finding a new use for an approved drug is called repurposing, an attractive path for mitochondrial diseases because of the reduced safety risks, low costs and fast timelines to a clinic-ready therapy or combination of therapies. Here I describe the first-ever drug repurposing screen for mitochondrial diseases involving complex I deficiency, e.g., Leigh syndrome, using the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica as a model system. Unlike the more commonly used yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae but like humans, Yarrowia lipolytica has a functional and metabolically integrated respiratory complex I and is an obligate aerobe. In 384-well-plate liquid culture format without shaking, Yarrowia lipolytica cells grown in either glucose-containing media or acetate-containing media were treated with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (3\u00b5M and 6\u03bcM, respectively) of the natural product and complex I inhibitor piericidin A. Out of 2,560 compounds in the Microsource Spectrum collection, 24 suppressors of piercidin A reached statistical significance in one or both media conditions. The suppressors include calcium channel blockers nisoldipine, amiodarone and tetrandrine as well as the farnesol-like sesquiterpenoids parthenolide, nerolidol and bisabolol, which may all be modulating mitochondrial calcium homeostasis. Estradiols and synthetic estrogen receptor agonists are the largest class of suppressors that rescue growth of piericidin-A-treated Yarrowia lipolytica cells in both glucose-containing and acetate-containing media. Analysis of structure-activity relationships suggests that estrogens may enhance bioenergetics by evolutionarily conserved interactions with mitochondrial membranes that promote mitochondrial filamentation and mitochondrial DNA replication.","Functional dressing with tailored physicochemical and biological properties is vital for diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) treatment. Our main objective in the current study was to fabricate Cellulose Acetate/Gelatin (CA/Gel) electrospun nanofibrous mat loaded with berberine (Beri) as the DFU dressing. The results demonstrated that the diameter of the nanofibers was around 502 nm, the tensile strength, contact angle, porosity, water vapor permeability, and water uptake ratio of CA/Gel nanofibers were around 2.83 MPa, 58.07, 78.17 %, 11.23 mg/cm2 hr, and 12.78 respectively, while these values for CA/Gel/Beri nanofibers were 2.69 \u00b1 0.05 MPa, 56.93 \u00b1 1, 76.17 \u00b1 0.76 %, 10.17 \u00b1 0.21 mg/cm2 hr, 14.37 \u00b1 0.42 respectively. The bacterial evaluations demonstrated that the dressings are an excellent barrier against bacterial penetration with potent antibacterial activity. The animal studies depicted that the collagen density and angiogenesis score in the CA/Gel/Beri treated group were 88.8\u00b16.7 % and 19.8\u00b13.8, respectively. These findings implied that the incorporation of berberine did not compromise the physical properties of dressing, while improving the biological activates. In conclusion, our findings implied that the prepared mat is a proper wound dressing for DFU management and treatment.","","Threats to crop production due to climate change are one of the greatest challenges facing plant breeders today. While considerable adaptive variation exists in traditional landraces, natural populations of crop wild relatives, and ex situ germplasm collections, separating adaptive alleles from linked deleterious variants that impact agronomic traits is challenging and has limited the utility of these diverse germplasm resources. Modern genome editing techniques such as CRISPR offer a potential solution by targeting specific alleles for transfer to new backgrounds, but such methods require a higher degree of precision than traditional mapping approaches can achieve. Here we present a high-resolution genome-wide association analysis to identify loci exhibiting adaptive patterns in a large panel of more than 4500 traditional maize landraces representing the breadth of genetic diversity of maize in Mexico. We evaluate associations between genotype and plant performance in 13 common gardens across a range of environments, identifying hundreds of candidate genes underlying genotype by environment interaction. We further identify genetic associations with environment across Mexico and show that such loci are associated with variation in yield and flowering time in our field trials and predict performance in independent drought trials. Our results indicate that the variation necessary to adapt crops to changing climate exists in traditional landraces that have been subject to ongoing environmental adaptation and can be identified by both phenotypic and environmental association.","","Economic choice necessarily involves the transformation of abstract, object-based representations to concrete, action-based ones. This transformation is both determined and delimited by the neuroanatomical organization of the regions that implement it. In choice, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) plays a key role in both abstract valuation and cognitive mapping. However, determining the neural processes underlying this transformation has proven difficult. We hypothesized that difficulty stems from in part from the fact that the OFC consists of multiple functionally distinct zones that are distinguished by their differing contributions to the abstract-concrete transformation, and that these functions reflect their differing long-range projections. Here we identify two such subregions, defined by stronger or weaker bidirectional anatomical connectivity with the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). We call these regions OFCin and OFCout, respectively. We find that OFCin, relative to OFCout, shows enhanced functional connectivity with PCC, as indicated by both spike-field coherence and mutual information. We find converging evidence that the OFCin-PCC circuit, but not the OFCout-PCC circuit, relays choice signals from an abstract value space to a concrete action space. Moreover, the OFCin-PCC circuit shows a putative bidirectional mutually excitatory pattern. Together, these results support the hypothesis that OFC-PCC subareal organization is critical for understanding the implementation of offer-action transformation in economic choice.","Mass Spectrometry imaging (MS imaging) provides spatial information for a wide range of compound classes in different sample matrices. We used MS imaging to investigate the distribution of components in fresh and processed food, including meat, dairy and bakery products. The MS imaging workflow was optimized to cater to the specific properties and challenges of the individual samples. We successfully detected highly nonpolar and polar constituents such as beta-carotene and anthocyanins, respectively. For the first time, the distribution of a contaminant and a food additive was visualized in processed food. We detected acrylamide in German gingerbread and investigated the penetration of the preservative natamycin into cheese. For this purpose, a new data analysis tool was developed to study the penetration of analytes from uneven surfaces. Our results show that MS imaging has great potential in food analysis to provide relevant information about components\u2019 distributions, particularly those underlying official regulations.","Mitochondrial respiratory complex subunits assemble in supercomplexes. Studies of supercomplexes have typically relied upon antibody-based protein quantification, often limited to the analysis of a single subunit per respiratory complex. To provide a deeper insight into mitochondrial and supercomplex plasticity, we combined Blue Native Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) and mass spectrometry to determine the supercomplexome of skeletal muscle from sedentary and exercise-trained mice. We quantified 422 mitochondrial proteins within ten supercomplex bands, in which we showed the debated presence of complex II and V. Upon exercise-induced mitochondrial biogenesis, non-stoichiometric changes in subunits and incorporation into supercomplexes was apparent. We uncovered the dynamics of supercomplex-related assembly proteins and mtDNA-encoded subunits within supercomplexes, as well as the complexes of ubiquinone biosynthesis enzymes and Lactb, a mitochondrial-localized protein implicated in obesity. Our approach can be applied to broad biological systems. In this instance, comprehensively analyzing respiratory supercomplexes illuminates previously undetectable complexity in mitochondrial plasticity.","Whole-body plethysmography (WBP) is an established method to determine physiological parameters and pathophysiological alteration of breathing in animals and animal models of a variety of diseases, reaching from pulmonary diseases to complex neurological syndromes. Although frequently used, there is ongoing debate about what exactly is measured by whole-body-plethysmography and how reliable the data derived from this method are? Here, we designed a simple device that can serve as an artificial lung model that enables a thorough evaluation of different predictions about and around whole-body plethysmography. Using our lung model, we confirmed that during WBP two components contribute to the pressure changes detected in the chamber: 1) the increase of the pressure due to heating and moistening of the air, termed as conditioning, during inspiration; 2) changes of chamber pressure that depend on airway resistance. Both components overlap and contribute to the temporal pressure-profile measured in the chamber or across the wall of the chamber. Our data showed that a precise measurement of the breathing volume appears to be hindered by at least two factors: 1) the unknown relative contribution of each of these components; 2) not only the air in the inspired volume is conditioned during inspiration, but also air within the residual volume and death space that is recruited during inspiration. Moreover, our data suggest that the expiratory negative pressure peak that is used to determine the so called \u201cenhanced pause\u201d (Penh) parameter is not a measure for airway resistance as such but rather a consequence of the animal\u2019s response to the airway resistance, using active expiration to overcome the resistance by a higher thoracic pressure.","","Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that mediates the degradation of cytoplasmic components in eukaryotic cells. In plants, autophagy has been extensively associated with the recycling of proteins during carbon starvation conditions. Even though lipids constitute a significant energy reserve, our understanding of the function of autophagy in the management of cell lipid reserves and components remains fragmented. To further investigate the significance of autophagy in lipid metabolism, we performed an extensive lipidomic characterization of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) autophagy mutants (atg) submitted to dark-induced senescence conditions. Our results revealed an altered lipid profile in atg mutants, suggesting that autophagy affects the homeostasis of multiple lipid components under dark-induced senescence. The acute degradation of chloroplast lipids coupled with the differential accumulation of triacylglycerols (TAGs) and plastoglobuli indicates an alternative metabolic reprogramming towards lipid storage in atg mutants. The imbalance of lipid metabolism compromises the production of cytosolic lipid droplets and the regulation of peroxisomal lipid oxidation pathways in atg mutants.","Increasing evidence suggests that dysregulation of lipid metabolism is associated with neurodegeneration in retinal diseases such as age-related macular degeneration and in brain disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s diseases. Lipid storage organelles (lipid droplets, LDs), accumulate in many cell types in response to stress, and it is now clear that LDs function not only as lipid stores but also as dynamic regulators of the stress response. However, whether these LD functions are always protective or can also be deleterious to the cell is unknown. Here, we investigated the consequences of LD accumulation on retinal cell homeostasis in transgenic flies and mice overexpressing fatty acid transport protein (FATP) in retinal pigment cells (RPCs). In wild-type Drosophila, overexpression of dFatp specifically in RPCs resulted in an expansion of LD size in both RPCs and in neighboring photoreceptors but was non-toxic. Similarly, in mice, LD accumulation induced by RPC-specific expression of human FATP1 was non-toxic and promoted mitochondrial energy metabolism in both RPCs and photoreceptor cells. In contrast, RPC-specific dFatp knockdown reduced neurodegeneration in Aats-metFB Drosophila mutants, which carry a defective respiratory chain, indicating that abnormal LD accumulation can be toxic under pathological conditions. Collectively, these findings indicate that FATP-mediated LD formation in RPCs induces a non-autonomous increase of LDs in photoreceptors that promotes homeostasis under physiological conditions but can be deleterious under pathological conditions.","Glaucoma is a group of disorders associated with retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration and death. There is a clear contribution of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress toward glaucomatous RGC death. Mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (Ucp2) is a well-known regulator of oxidative stress that increases cell survival in acute models of oxidative damage. The impact of Ucp2 on cell survival during sub-acute and chronic neurodegenerative conditions however is not yet clear. Herein, we test the hypothesis that increased Ucp2 expression will improve retinal ganglion cell survival in a mouse model of glaucoma. We show that increasing retinal ganglion cell but not glial Ucp2 expression in transgenic animals decreases glaucomatous RGC death, but also that the PPAR-\u03b3 agonist rosiglitazone, an endogenous transcriptional activator of Ucp2, does not significantly alter RGC loss during glaucoma. Together, these data support a model whereby increased Ucp2 expression mediates neuroprotection during a long-term oxidative stressor, but that transcriptional activation alone is insufficient to elicit a neuroprotective effect, motivating further research in to the post-transcriptional regulation of Ucp2.","Root and root-released organic anions play important roles in uptake of phosphorus (P), an essential macronutrient for food production. Oat, ranking sixth in the world\u2019s cereal production, contains valuable nutritional compounds and can withstand poor soil conditions. The aim of this research was to investigate root transcriptional and metabolic responses of oat grown under P-deficient and P-sufficient conditions. We conducted a hydroponic experiment and measured root morphology, organic anions exudation, and analysed changes in the transcriptome and metabolome, to understand oat root adaptation to P deficiency. We found that oat roots showed enhanced citrate and malate exudation after four weeks of P-deficiency. After 10 days of P-deficiency, we identified 9371 differentially expressed transcripts with a two-fold or greater change (p &lt; 0.05): forty-eight sequences predicted to be involved in organic anion biosynthesis and efflux were consistently up-regulated; twenty-four up-regulated transcripts in oat were also found up-regulated upon P starvation in rice and wheat under similar conditions. Phosphorylated metabolites (i.e. glucose-6-phosphate, myo-inositol-phosphate) reduced dramatically, while citrate and malate, some sugars and amino acids increased slightly in P-deficient oat roots. Our data provide new insights into the root responses to P deficiency and root-released organic anions in oat.","Naturalistic stimuli, such as movies, are being increasingly used to map brain function because of their high ecological validity. The pioneering studyforrest and other naturalistic neuroimaging projects have provided free access to multiple movie-watching functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets to prompt the community for naturalistic experimental paradigms. However, sluggish blood-oxygenation-level-dependent fMRI signals are incapable of resolving neuronal activity with the temporal resolution at which it unfolds. Instead, magnetoencephalography (MEG) measures changes in the magnetic field produced by neuronal activity and is able to capture rich dynamics of the brain at the millisecond level while watching naturalistic movies. Herein, we present the first public prolonged MEG dataset collected from 11 participants while watching the 2 h long audio-visual movie \u201cForrest Gump\u201d. Minimally preprocessed data was also provided to facilitate the use of the dataset. As a studyforrest extension, we envision that this dataset, together with fMRI data from the studyforrest project, will serve as a foundation for exploring the neural dynamics of various cognitive functions in real-world contexts.","Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has become one of the major tools for establishing the causal role of specific brain regions in perceptual, motor, and cognitive processes. Nevertheless, a persistent limitation of the technique is the lack of clarity regarding its precise effects on neural activity. Here, we examined the effects of TMS intensity and frequency on concurrently recorded blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals at the site of stimulation. In two experiments, we delivered TMS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in human subjects of both sexes. In Experiment 1, we delivered a series of pulses at high (100% of motor threshold) or low (50% of motor threshold) intensity, whereas in Experiment 2, we always used high intensity but delivered stimulation at four different frequencies (5, 8.33, 12.5, and 25 Hz). We found that the TMS intensity and frequency could be reliably decoded using multivariate analysis techniques even though TMS had no effect on overall BOLD activity at the site of stimulation in either experiment. These results provide important insight into the mechanisms through which TMS influences neural activity.","Neural mechanisms are complex and difficult to image. This paper presents a new space-time resolved whole-brain imaging framework, called Neurophysiological Mechanism Imaging (NMI), that identifies neurophysiological mechanisms within cerebral cortex at the macroscopic scale. By fitting neural mass models to electromagnetic source imaging data using a novel nonlinear inference method, population averaged membrane potentials and synaptic connection strengths are efficiently and accurately imaged across the whole brain at a resolution afforded by source imaging. The efficiency of the framework enables return of the augmented source imaging results overnight using high performance computing. This suggests it can be used as a practical and novel imaging tool. To demonstrate the framework, it has been applied to resting-state magnetoencephalographic source estimates. The results suggest that endogenous inputs to cingulate, occipital, and inferior frontal cortex are essential modulators of resting-state alpha power. Moreover, endogenous input and inhibitory and excitatory neural populations play varied roles in mediating alpha power in different resting-state sub-networks. The framework can be applied to arbitrary neural mass models and has broad applicability to image neural mechanisms in different brain states.","Wheatgrass has emerged as a functional food source in recent years, but the detailed metabolomics basis for its health benefits remains poorly understood. In this study, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis were used to study the metabolic profiling of seedlings from wheat, barley, rye and triticale, which revealed 1800 features in positive mode and 4303 features in negative mode. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed clear differences between species, and 164 differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) were detected, including amino acids, organic acids, lipids, fatty acids, nucleic acids, flavonoids, amines, polyamines, vitamins, sugar derivatives and others. Unique metabolites in each species were identified. This study provides a glimpse into the metabolomics profiles of wheat and its wild relatives, which may form an important basis for nutrition, health and other parameters.","One of the very first observations made regarding alpha oscillations (8\u201314 Hz), is that they increase in power over posterior areas when awake participants close their eyes. Recent work, especially in the context of (spatial) attention, suggests that alpha activity reflects a mechanism of functional inhibition. However, it remains unclear how eye closure impacts anticipatory alpha modulation observed in attention paradigms, and how this affects subsequent behavioral performance. Here, we recorded magnetoencephalography (MEG) in 33 human participants performing a tactile discrimination task with their eyes open vs. closed. We replicated the hallmarks of previous somatosensory spatial attention studies: alpha lateralization across the somatosensory cortices as well as alpha increase over posterior regions. Furthermore, we found that eye closure leads to (i) reduced task performance, (ii) widespread increase in alpha power, and (iii) reduced anticipatory visual alpha modulation (iv) with no effect on somatosensory alpha lateralization. Regardless of whether participants had their eyes open or closed, increased posterior alpha power and somatosensory alpha lateralization improved their performance. Thus, we provide evidence that eye closure does not alter the impact of anticipatory alpha modulations on behavioral performance. We propose there is an optimal posterior alpha level for somatosensory task performance, which can be achieved through a combination of eye closure and top-down anticipatory attention.","A growing list of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) genetic risk factors is being identified, but the contribution of these genetic mutations to disease remains largely unknown. Accumulating data support a role of lipid dysregulation and excessive ROS in the etiology of AD. Here, we identified cell-specific roles for eight AD risk-associated genes in ROS-induced glial lipid droplet (LD) formation. We demonstrate that ROS-induced glial LD formation requires two ABCA transporters (ABCA1 and ABCA7) in neurons, the APOE receptor (LRP1), endocytic genes (PICALM, CD2AP, and AP2A2) in glia, and retromer genes (VPS26 and VPS35) in both neurons and glia. Moreover, ROS strongly enhances A\u03b242-toxicity in flies and A\u03b242-plaque formation in mice. Finally, an ABCA1-activating peptide restores glial LD formation in the APOE4-associated loss of LD. This study places AD risk factors in a neuron-to-glia lipid transfer pathway with a critical role in protecting neurons from ROS-induced toxicity.","High-impact temporomandibular disorder (TMD) pain may involve brain mechanisms related to central sensitization. We investigated brain responses to stimulation of trigeminal sites not typically associated with TMD pain by applying noxious dentoalveolar pressure to high- and low-impact TMD pain cases and pain-free controls during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Fifty female participants were recruited and assigned to one of three groups based on the Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (DC/TMD) and Graded Chronic Pain Scale: controls (n=17), low-impact (n=17) and high-impact TMD (n=16). Multimodal whole-brain MRI was acquired following the Human Connectome Project protocol, including stimulus-evoked fMRI scans during which painful dentoalveolar pressure was applied to the buccal gingiva of participants. Group analyses were performed using non-parametric permutation tests for parcellated cortical and subcortical neuroimaging data. There were no significant between-group differences for brain activations/deactivations evoked by the noxious dentoalveolar pressure. For individual group mean activations/deactivations, a gradient in the number of parcels surviving thresholding was found according to the TMD pain grade, with the highest number seen in the high-impact group. Among the brain regions activated in chronic TMD pain groups were those previously implicated in sensory-discriminative and motivational-affective pain processing. These results suggest that dentoalveolar pressure pain evokes abnormal brain responses to sensory processing of noxious stimuli in high-impact TMD pain participants, which supports the presence of maladaptive brain plasticity in chronic TMD pain.","Summary While over ten thousand genetic loci have been associated with phenotypic traits and inherited diseases in genome-wide association studies, in most cases only a relatively small proportion of the trait heritability is explained and biological mechanisms underpinning these traits have not been clearly identified. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) are subsets of genomic loci shown experimentally to influence gene expression. Since gene expression is one of the primary determinants of phenotype, the identification of eQTL may reveal biologically relevant loci and provide functional links between genomic variants, gene expression and ultimately phenotype. Skeletal muscle (gluteus medius) gene expression was quantified by RNA-seq for 111 Thoroughbreds (47 male, 64 female) in race training at a single training establishment sampled at two time-points: at rest (n = 92) and four hours after high-intensity exercise (n = 77); n = 60 were sampled at both time points. Genotypes were generated from the Illumina Equine SNP70 BeadChip. Applying a Benjamini-Hochberg corrected P-value threshold (PFDR &lt; 0.05), association tests identified 3,583 cis-eQTL associated with expression of 1,456 genes at rest; 4,992 cis-eQTL associated with the expression of 1,922 genes post-exercise; 1,703 trans-eQTL associated with 563 genes at rest; and 1,219 trans-eQTL associated with 425 genes post-exercise. The gene with the highest cis-eQTL association at both time-points was the endosome-associated-trafficking regulator 1 gene (ENTR1; Rest: PFDR = 3.81 \u00d7 10\u221227, Post-exercise: PFDR = 1.66 \u00d7 10\u221224), which has a potential role in the transcriptional regulation of the solute carrier family 2 member 1 glucose transporter protein (SLC2A1). Functional analysis of genes with significant eQTL revealed significant enrichment for cofactor metabolic processes. These results suggest heritable variation in genomic elements such as regulatory sequences (e.g. gene promoters, enhancers, silencers), microRNA and transcription factor genes, which are associated with metabolic function and may have roles in determining end-point muscle and athletic performance phenotypes in Thoroughbred horses.","This article examines biodiversity research and innovation in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean based on a review of 150,401 scientific articles and 29,690 patent families for Antarctic species. The paper exploits the growing availability of open access databases, such as the Lens and Microsoft Academic Graph, along with taxonomic data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) to explore the scientific and patent literature for the Antarctic at scale. The paper identifies the main contours of scientific research in Antarctica before exploring commercially oriented biodiversity research and development in the scientific literature and patent publications. The paper argues that biodiversity is not a free good and must be paid for. Ways forward in debates on commercial research and development in Antarctica can be found through increasing attention to the valuation of ecosystem services, new approaches to natural capital accounting and payment for ecosystem services that would bring the Antarctic, and the Antarctic Treaty System, into the wider fold of work on the economics of biodiversity. Economics based approaches can be criticised for reducing biodiversity to monetary exchange values at the expense of recognition of the wider values of biodiversity and its services. However, approaches grounded in the economics of biodiversity provide a transparent framework for approaching commercial activity in the Antarctic and introducing requirements for investments in the conservation of Antarctic biodiversity by those who seek to profit from it.","","Background Non-\u00adresolving activation of immune responses is central to the pathogenesis of heart failure (HF). Free fatty acid receptor 4 (Ffar4) is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPR) for medium-and long-chain fatty acids (FA) that regulates metabolism and attenuates inflammation in diabetes and obesity. Here, we tested the hypothesis that Ffar4 functions as a cardioprotective nutrient sensor that resolves inflammation to maintain cardiac homeostasis.","Seed germination is considered as the beginning of the spermatophyte lifecycle, as it is a crucial stage in determining subsequent plant growth and development. Although many previous studies have found that melatonin can promote seed germination, the role of melatonin in cotton germination remains unexamined. The main objective of this study is the characterization of potential promotional effects of melatonin (at doses of 0, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200 \u03bcM) on cotton seed germination. This experiment demonstrated that low concentrations of melatonin can promote germination, while high concentrations failed to promote germination and even inhibited germination. Together, these results indicate that a 20 \u03bcM melatonin treatment optimally promotes cotton seed germination. Compared with the control, germination potential (GP), germination rate (GR) and final fresh weight (FW) increased by 16.67%, 12.30% and 4.81% respectively. Although low concentrations of melatonin showed some improvement in vigor index (VI), germination index (GI) and mean germination time (MGT), these effects did not reach significant levels. Antioxidant enzyme activity during seed germination was most prominent under the 20 \u03bcM melatonin treatment. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) activities were significantly increased by 10.37\u201359.73% and 17.79\u201347.68% compared to the melatonin-free control. Malondialdehyde (MDA) content was reduced by 16.73\u201340.33%. Two important plant hormones in seed germination were also studied. As melatonin concentration increased, ABA content in seeds decreased first and then increased, and GA3 content showed a diametrically opposite trend, in which the 20 \u03bcM melatonin treatment was optimal. The 20 \u03bcM melatonin treatment reduced ABA content in seeds by 42.13\u201351.68%, while the 20 \u03bcM melatonin treatment increased GA3 content in seeds to about 1.7\u20132.5 times that of seeds germinated without melatonin. This study provides new evidence suggesting that low concentrations of melatonin can promote cotton seed germination by increasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes, thereby reducing the accumulation of MDA and regulating plant hormones. This has clear applications for improving the germination rate of cotton seeds using melatonin.","MCL-1 is a pro-survival BCL-2 protein required for the sustained growth of many cancers. Recently a highly specific MCL-1-inhibitor, S63845, showing 6-fold higher affinity to human compared to mouse MCL-1 has been described. To accurately test efficacy and tolerability of this BH3 mimetic drug in pre-clinical cancer models, we developed a humanized Mcl-1 (huMcl-1) mouse in which MCL-1 was replaced with its human homologue. HuMcl-1 mice are phenotypically indistinguishable from wild-type mice but are more sensitive to MCL-1 inhibition. Importantly, non-transformed cells and lymphomas from huMcl-1;E\u03bc-Myc mice are more sensitive to S63845 in vitro than their control counterparts. When huMcl-1;E\u03bc-Myc lymphoma cells are transplanted into huMcl-1 mice, treatment with S63845 alone or alongside cyclophosphamide leads to long-term remission in ~60% or almost 100% of mice, respectively. These results demonstrate the potential of our huMCL-1 mouse model to test MCL-1 inhibitors, allowing precise predictions of efficacy and tolerability for clinical translation.","E-cigarette and vaping device use continue to rise, particularly in adolescents and young adults, but the safety of inhaling the multitude of chemicals within e-cigarette aerosols has been questioned. While several studies have evaluated vaping effects on the lungs and heart; effects on the gastrointestinal tract remain unknown. Using established murine models of acute (1 week) and chronic (3 month) daily e-cigarette aerosol inhalation, both with nicotine-containing and vehicle control e-liquids, murine colon transcriptomics and organoid co-culture models, we assessed the effects of e-cigarette use on the gut barrier and mucosal health. Histologic analyses revealed that chronic exposure to nicotine-free e-cigarette aerosols induced mucosal inflammation. Transcriptome analyses revealed that chronic, but not acute, nicotine-free e-cigarette use significantly reduced expression of tight junction markers, including occluding, and drove expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Exposure of murine and human enteroid-derived monolayers (EDMs) to nicotine-free e-cigarette aerosols alone, or in co-culture with invasive E. coli, confirmed that repetitive exposure was sufficient to recapitulate the key findings observed in vivo, i.e., barrier-disruption, downregulation of occludin, inflammation, and an accentuated risk of and response to bacterial infection. These data highlight an unexpected harmful effect of e-cigarette use on the gut barrier and pinpoint non-nicotine chemical components common across &gt;90% of e-cigarette e-liquids as the source of harm. Given the ever-expanding importance of the integrity of the gut barrier for host fitness, and impact of gut mucosal inflammation on a multitude of chronic diseases, these findings are broadly relevant to medicine and public health.","Word familiarity and predictive context facilitate visual word processing, leading to faster recognition times and reduced neuronal responses. Previously, models with and without top-down connections, including lexical-semantic, pre-lexical (e.g., orthographic/ phonological), and visual processing levels were successful in accounting for these facilitation effects. Here we systematically assessed context-based facilitation with a repetition priming task and explicitly dissociated pre-lexical and lexical processing levels using a pseudoword familiarization procedure. Experiment 1 investigated the temporal dynamics of neuronal facilitation effects with magnetoencephalography (MEG; N=38 human participants) while Experiment 2 assessed behavioral facilitation effects (N=24 human participants). Across all stimulus conditions, MEG demonstrated context-based facilitation across multiple time windows starting at 100 ms, in occipital brain areas. This finding indicates context based-facilitation at an early visual processing level. In both experiments, we furthermore found an interaction of context and lexical familiarity, such that stimuli with associated meaning showed the strongest context-dependent facilitation in brain activation and behavior. Using MEG, this facilitation effect could be localized to the left anterior temporal lobe at around 400 ms, indicating within-level (i.e., exclusively lexical-semantic) facilitation but no top-down effects on earlier processing stages. Increased pre-lexical familiarity (in pseudowords familiarized utilizing training) did not enhance or reduce context effects significantly. We conclude that context based-facilitation is achieved within visual and lexical processing levels. Finally, by testing alternative hypotheses derived from mechanistic accounts of repetition suppression, we suggest that the facilitatory context effects found here are implemented using a predictive coding mechanism.","Regulated cell necrosis supports immune and anti-infectious strategies of the body; however, dysregulation of these processes drives pathological organ damage. Pseudomonas aeruginosa expresses a phospholipase, ExoU that triggers pathological host cell necrosis through a poorly characterized pathway. Here, we investigated the molecular and cellular mechanisms of ExoU-mediated necrosis. We show that cellular peroxidised phospholipids enhance ExoU phospholipase activity, which drives necrosis of immune and non-immune cells. Conversely, both the endogenous lipid peroxidation regulator GPX4 and the pharmacological inhibition of lipid peroxidation delay ExoU-dependent cell necrosis and improve bacterial elimination in vitro and in vivo. Our findings also pertain to the ExoU-related phospholipase from the bacterial pathogen Burkholderia thailandensis, suggesting that exploitation of peroxidised phospholipids might be a conserved virulence mechanism among various microbial phospholipases. Overall, our results identify an original lipid peroxidation-based virulence mechanism as a strong contributor of microbial phospholipase-driven pathology.","Cetaceans are a group of marine mammals whose ancestors were adaptated for life on land. Life in an aquatic environment poses many challenges for air-breathing mammals. Diving marine mammals have adapted to rapid reoxygenation and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated reperfusion injury. Here, we considered the evolution of the glutathione transferase (GST) gene family which has important roles in the detoxification of endogenously-derived ROS and environmental pollutants. We characterized the cytosolic GST gene family in 21 mammalian species; cetaceans, sirenians, pinnipeds, and their terrestrial relatives. All seven GST classes were identified, showing that GSTs are ubiquitous in mammals. Some GST genes are the product of lineage-specific duplications and losses, in line with a birth-and-death evolutionary model. We detected sites with signatures of positive selection that possibly influence GST structure and function, suggesting that adaptive evolution of GST genes is important for defending mammals from various types of noxious environmental compounds. We also found evidence for loss of alpha and mu GST subclass genes in cetacean lineages. Notably, cetaceans have retained a homolog of at least one of the genes GSTA1, GSTA4, and GSTM1; GSTs that are present in both the cytosol and mitochondria. The observed variation in number and selection pressure on GST genes suggest that the gene family structure is dynamic within cetaceans. Taken together, our results indicate that the cytosolic GST family in cetaceans reflects unique evolutionary dynamics related to oxygen-poor aquatic environments.","Silver-based antimicrobials are widely used topically to treat infections associated with multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens. Expanding this topical use to aerosols to treat lung infections requires understanding and preventing silver toxicity in the respiratory tract. A key mechanism resulting in silver-induced toxicity is the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this study, we have verified ROS generation in silver-treated bronchial epithelial (16HBE) cells prompting evaluation of three antioxidants, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), ascorbic acid, and melatonin, to identify potential prophylactic agents. Among them, NAC was the only candidate that abrogated the ROS generation in response to silver exposure resulting in the rescue of these cells from silver-associated toxicity. Further, this protective effect directly translated to restoration of metabolic activity, as demonstrated by the normal levels of citric acid cycle metabolites in NAC-pretreated silver-exposed cells. As a result of the normalized citric acid cycle, cells pre-incubated with NAC demonstrated significantly higher levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels compared with NAC-free controls. Moreover, we found that this prodigious capacity of NAC to rescue silver-exposed cells was due not only to its antioxidant activity, but also to its ability to directly bind silver. Despite binding to silver, NAC did not alter the antimicrobial activity of silver.","The bone marrow is the place of hematopoiesis with a microenvironment that supports lifelong maintenance of stem cells and high proliferation. It is not surprising that this environment is also favourable for malignant cells emerging in the bone marrow or metastasizing to it. While the cellular composition of the bone marrow microenvironment has been extensively studied, the extracellular matrix and interstitial fluid components have received little attention. Since the sinusoids connect the bone marrow interstitial fluid to the circulation, it is often considered to have the same composition as peripheral blood plasma. Stark differences in the cellular composition of the bone marrow and peripheral blood with different secretory capacities would however suggest profound differences.","Currently, there are a lack of FDA-approved tocolytics for the management of preterm labor. We previously observed that the isoflavones mundulone and mundulone acetate (MA) inhibit intracellular Ca2+-regulated myometrial contractility. Here, we further probed the potential of these natural products to be small molecule leads for discovery of novel tocolytics by: (1) examining uterine-selectivity by comparing concentration-response between human primary myometrial cells and a major off-target site, aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), (2) identifying synergistic combinations with current clinical tocolytics to increase efficacy or and reduce off-target side effects, (3) determining cytotoxic effects and (4) investigating the efficacy, potency and tissue-selectivity between myometrial contractility and constriction of fetal ductus arteriosus (DA), a major off-target of current tocolytics. Mundulone displayed significantly greater efficacy (Emax = 80.5% vs. 44.5%, p=0.0005) and potency (IC50 = 27 \u03bcM and 14 \u03bcM, p=0.007) compared to MA in the inhibition of intracellular-Ca2+ from myometrial cells. MA showed greater uterine-selectivity, compared to mundulone, based on greater differences in the IC50 (4.3 vs. 2.3 fold) and Emax (70% vs. 0%) between myometrial cells compared to aorta VSMCs. Moreover, MA demonstrated a favorable in vitro therapeutic index of 8.8, compared to TI = 0.8 of mundulone, due to its significantly (p&lt;0.0005) smaller effect on the viability of myometrial (hTERT-HM), liver (HepG2) and kidney (RPTEC) cells. However, mundulone exhibited synergism with two current tocolytics (atosiban and nifedipine), while MA only displayed synergistic efficacy with only nifedipine. Of these synergistic combinations, only mundulone + atosiban demonstrated a favorable TI = 10 compared to TI=0.8 for mundulone alone. While only mundulone showed concentration-dependent inhibition of ex vivo mouse myometrial contractions, neither mundulone or MA affected mouse fetal DA vasoreactivity. The combination of mundulone and atosiban yielded greater tocolytic efficacy and potency on term pregnant mouse and human myometrial tissue compared to single-drugs. Collectively, these data highlight the difference in uterine-selectivity of Ca2+-mobilization, effects on cell viability and tocolytic efficacy between mundulone and MA. These natural products could benefit from medicinal chemistry efforts to study the structural activity relationship for further development into a promising single- and/or combination-tocolytic therapy for management of preterm labor.","","Recent advances in single-cell genomics and transcriptomics technologies have transformed our understanding of cellular heterogeneity in growth, development, ageing and disease. Despite these advances, however, single-cell metabolite profiling (i.e., metabolomics) methods have comparatively lagged behind due to limitations in technology. We have developed a high-throughput method for the detection and quantification of a wide range of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and sphingomyelin (SM) species from single cells that combines fluorescence-assisted cell sorting (FACS) with automated chip-based nanoelectrospray ionisation (nanoESI) and shotgun lipidomics. We show herein that our method is capable of quantifying more than 50 different PC and SM species from single cells and can easily distinguish between cells of different lineages or cells treated with exogenous fatty acids. Moreover, our method can detect more subtle differences in the lipidome between cell lines of the same cancer type. Our approach has the capacity to be run in parallel with other single-cell technologies to deliver near-complete multi-omics data on cells with a similar phenotype and has the capacity to significantly advance our current knowledge on cellular heterogeneity.","Typical adults read remarkably quickly. Such fast reading is facilitated by brain processes that are sensitive to both word frequency and contextual constraints. It is debated as to whether these attributes have additive or interactive effects on language processing in the brain. We investigated this issue by analysing existing magnetoencephalography data from 99 participants reading intact and scrambled sentences. Using a cross-validated model comparison scheme, we found that lexical frequency predicted the word-by-word elicited MEG signal in a widespread cortical network, irrespective of sentential context. In contrast, index (ordinal word position) was more strongly encoded in sentence words, in left front-temporal areas. This confirms that frequency influences word processing independently of predictability, and that contextual constraints affect word-by-word brain responses. With a conservative multiple comparisons correction, only the interaction between lexical frequency and surprisal survived, in anterior temporal and frontal cortex, and not between lexical frequency and entropy, nor between lexical frequency and index. However, interestingly, the uncorrected index*frequency interaction revealed an effect in left frontal and temporal cortex that reversed in time and space for intact compared to scrambled sentences. Finally, we provide evidence to suggest that, in sentences, lexical frequency and predictability may independently influence early (&lt;150ms) and late stages of word processing, but also interact during late stages of word processing (&gt;150-250ms), thus helping to converge previous contradictory eye-tracking and electrophysiological literature. Current neuro-cognitive models of reading would benefit from accounting for these differing effects of lexical frequency and predictability on different stages of word processing.","","Although techniques for non-invasive brain stimulation are under intense investigation, an approach that has received limited attention is transcranial photobiomodulation (tPBM), the delivery of near-infrared light to the brain with a laser directed at the scalp. Here we employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure the Blood-Oxygenation-Level Dependent (BOLD) signal in n = 20 healthy humans while concurrently stimulating their right frontal pole with a near-infrared laser. We failed to detect an evoked BOLD response at illumination. However, functional connectivity with the illuminated region increased by an average of 10% during stimulation, with some connections strengthening by as much as 40%. 23% of connections with the illuminated region experienced a significant acute increase, with the time course of connectivity exhibiting a sharp rise at illumination onset. Brain-wide connectivity increases were also observed, with connections in the stimulated hemisphere showing a significantly larger increase than those in the non-stimulated hemisphere. We subsequently employed MR Thermometry to measure brain temperature during tPBM (separate cohort, n = 20), and found no significant temperature differences between active and sham stimulation. Our findings suggest that near-infrared light synchronizes brain activity with a non-thermal mechanism, underscoring the promise of tPBM as a new technique for stimulating brain function.","Malignant melanoma is one of the most common types of cancer in the United States. Despite recent and well-described progress in melanoma treatment, advanced disease still carries a poor prognosis for many patients and chemotherapy has been appropriately abandoned as a front-line option. Wild-type isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (wtIDH1) has recently been implicated as a metabolic dependency in cancer. The enzyme is protective to cancer cells under metabolic stress, including oxidative damage by conventional chemotherapy and nutrient limitation characteristic of the tumor microenvironment. Specifically, the cytosolic enzyme generates NADPH to maintain redox homeostasis. IDH1 also supports mitochondrial function through anaplerosis of its reaction product, \u03b1-ketoglutarate. We show that melanoma patients express higher levels of the wtIDH1 enzyme compared to normal skin tissue, and elevated wtIDH1 expression portends poor patient survival. Knockdown of IDH1 by RNA interference inhibited cell proliferation and migration under low nutrient levels. Suppression of IDH1 expression in melanoma also decreased NADPH and glutathione levels, resulting in increased reactive oxygen species. An FDA-approved inhibitor of mutant IDH1, ivosidenib (AG-120), exhibited potent anti-wtIDH1 properties under low magnesium and nutrient levels, reflective of the tumor microenvironment in natura. Similarly, findings were replicated in murine models of melanoma. Further, wtIDH1 inhibition was synergistic to conventional anti-melanoma chemotherapy in pre-clinical models. This work points to a novel and readily available combination treatment strategy for patients with advanced and refractory melanoma.","Clubroot caused by the protist Plasmodiophora brassicae is a major disease affecting cultivated Brassicaceae. Here, we uncover the existence of a natural epigenetic variation that is associated with partial resistance to clubroot in Arabidopsis, by using QTL fine mapping followed by extensive DNA sequence and methylation analyses. We show that at QTL Pb-At5.2, DNA methylation variation is extensive across accessions and strictly correlates with expression variation of the two neighboring genes At5g47260 and At5g47280, which encode NLR-immune receptors. Moreover, these natural variants are stably inherited and are not consistently associated with any nucleotide variation. These findings suggest a direct role for epigenetic variation in quantitative resistance of plants to pathogen attacks.","Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) 12-oxophytodienoic acid reductase isoform 3 (OPR3) is involved in the synthesis of jasmonic acid by reducing the \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated double bond of the cyclopentenone moiety in 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid. Recent research revealed that jasmonic acid synthesis is not strictly dependent on the peroxisomal OPR3. In addition, OPR3 is able to reduce trinitrotoluene suggesting that the old yellow enzyme homologue OPR3 has additional functions. Here we demonstrate that OPR3 catalyzes the reduction of a wide spectrum of electrophilic species that share a reactivity towards the major redox buffers glutathione (GSH) and ascorbate (ASC). Furthermore, we demonstrate that OPDA reacts with ascorbate to form an ASC-OPDA adduct, but in addition OPR3 has the ability to regenerate ASC from monodehydroascorbate (MDHA). The presented data characterize OPR3 as a bifunctional enzyme with NADPH-dependent \u03b1,\u03b2-ketoalkene double bond reductase and monodehydroascorbate reductase activities (MDHAR). opr3 mutants exhibited a slightly less reduced ASC pool in leaves in line with the MDHAR activity of OPR3 in vitro. These functions link redox homeostasis as mediated by ASC and GSH with OPR3 activity and metabolism of reactive electrophilic species (RES).","","The development of alternatives to antibiotics is crucial to limiting the incidence of antimicrobial resistance, especially in prophylactic and metaphylactic use to control post-weaning diarrhea (PWD). Feed additives, including bioactive compounds, could be a promising alternative. This study aimed to test two bioactive compounds, sodium salicylate (SA) and a chestnut extract (CE) containing hydrolysable tannins, on the occurrence of PWD. At weaning, 72 piglets were assigned to four treatments that combined two factors: CE supplementation (with 2% of CE (CE+) or without (CE-)) and SA supplementation (with 35 mg/kg BW of SA (SA+) or without (SA-)). Then, 4 days after weaning, all piglets were infected with a suspension at 108 CFU/ml of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC F4ac). Each piglet had free access to an electrolyte solution containing, or not, SA. This SA supplementation was administered for 5 days (i.e., from the day of infection (day 0) to 4 days post-infection (day 4). During the 2 weeks post-infection, supplementation with SA had no effect (P &gt; 0.05) on growth performances nor on fecal scores. A significant SA \u00d7 time interaction (P &lt; 0.01) for fecal scores and the percentage of diarrhea indicated that piglets with SA did not recover faster and did have a second episode of diarrhea. In contrast to SA treatment, inclusion of CE increased (P &lt; 0.05) growth performances and feed intake. In the first week post-infection, CE decreased (P &lt; 0.001) the overall fecal scores, the percentage of piglets with diarrhea, the days in diarrhea, and ETEC shedding in the feces. There was a SA\u00d7CE interaction (P &lt; 0.05) for ETEC shedding, suggesting a negative effect of combining SA with CE. This study highlighted that, in contrast to SA, CE could represent a promising alternative to antibiotics immediately after weaning for improving growth performance and reducing PWD.","Speech comprehension requires the ability to temporally segment the acoustic input for higher-level linguistic analysis. Oscillation-based approaches suggest that low-frequency auditory cortex oscillations track syllable-sized acoustic information and therefore emphasize the relevance of syllabic-level processing for speech segmentation. Most linguistic approaches, however, focus on mapping from acoustic-phonemic representations to the lexical level. How syllabic processing interacts with higher levels of speech processing, beyond segmentation, including the anatomical and neurophysiological characteristics of the networks involved, is debated. Here we investigate the effects of lexical processing and the interactions with (acoustic) syllable processing by examining MEG data recorded in two experiments using a frequency-tagging paradigm. Participants listened to disyllabic words presented at a rate of 4 syllables/sec. Two conjectures were evaluated: (i) lexical processing of words activates a network that interacts with syllable processing; and (ii) syllable transitions contribute to word-level processing. We show that lexical content activated a left-lateralized frontal and superior and middle temporal network and increased the interaction between left middle temporal areas and auditory cortex (phase-phase coupling). Mere syllable-transition information, in contrast, activated a bilateral superior-, middle temporal and inferior frontal network and increased the interaction between those areas. Word and syllable processing interacted in superior and middle temporal areas (cross-frequency coupling), whereas syllable tracking (cerebro-acoustic coherence) decreased when word-level information was present. The data provide a new perspective on speech comprehension by demonstrating a contribution of an acoustic-syllabic to lexical processing route.","Cancer of gastrointestinal tract, such as colorectal cancer (CRC) and gastric cancer (GC), are common types of cancer globally and their origin can be linked to oxidative stress conditions. Commonly available antioxidants, such as vitamins C and E, are widely considered as potential anti-cancer agents. Raman spectra have great potential in the biochemical characterization of matter based on the fact that each molecule has its own unique vibrational properties. Raman spectroscopy allows to precisely characterized cell substructures (nucleus, mitochondria, cytoplasm, cell membrane) and components (proteins, lipids, nucleic acids).","Evidence for epigenetic regulation playing a role in Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is growing, particularly for DNA modifications. Approximately 90% of PD cases are due to a complex interaction between age, genes, and environmental factors, and epigenetic marks are thought to mediate the relationship between aging, genetics, the environment, and disease risk. To date, there are a small number of published genome-wide studies of DNA modifications in PD, but none accounted for cell-type or sex in their analyses. Given the hetereogeneity of bulk brain tissue samples and known sex differences in PD risk, progression, and severity, these are critical variables to account for. In this first genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation in an enriched neuronal population from PD post-mortem parietal cortex, we report sex-specific PD-associated methylation changes in PARK7 (DJ-1), SLC17A6 (VGLUT2), PTPRN2 (IA-2\u03b2), NR4A2 (NURR1), and other genes involved in developmental pathways, neurotransmitter packaging and release, and axon and neuron projection guidance.","The brain\u2019s remarkable capacity to process spoken language virtually in real time requires fast and efficient information processing machinery. In this study, we investigated how frequency-specific brain dynamics relate to models of probabilistic language prediction during auditory narrative comprehension. We recorded MEG activity while participants were listening to auditory stories in Dutch. Using trigram statistical language models, we estimated for every word in a story its conditional probability of occurrence. On the basis of word probabilities, we computed how unexpected the current word is given its context (word perplexity) and how (un)predictable the current linguistic context is (word entropy). We then evaluated whether source-reconstructed MEG oscillations at different frequency bands are modulated as a function of these language processing metrics. We show that theta-band source dynamics are increased in high relative to low entropy states, likely reflecting lexical computations. Beta-band dynamics are increased in situations of low word entropy and perplexity possibly reflecting maintenance of ongoing cognitive context. These findings lend support to the idea that the brain engages in the active generation and evaluation of predicted language based on the statistical properties of the input signal.","Cancer cells develop tactics to circumvent the interventions by desensitizing themselves to interventions. The principle routes of desensitization include a) activation of survival pathways (e.g. NF-kB, PARP) and b) downregulation of cell death pathways (e.g. CD95/CD95L). As a result, it requires high therapeutic dose to achieve tumor regression which, in turn damages normal cells through the collateral damaging effects. Methods are needed to sensitize the low and non-responsive resistant tumor cells including cancer stem cells (CSCs) in order to evoke a better response from the current treatments. Current treatments including chemotherapy can induce cell death only in bulk cancer cells sparing CSCs and cancer resistant cells (CRCs) which are shown to be responsible for high recurrence of disease and low patient survival. Here, we report several novel tumor targeted sensitizers derived from the natural Vitamin E analogue (AMP-001-003). The drug design is based on a novel concept \u201cA priori activation of apoptosis pathways of tumor technology (AAAPT) which is designed to activate specific cell death pathways and inhibit survival pathways simultaneously. Our results indicate that AMP-001-003 sensitize various types of cancer cells including MDA-MB-231 (triple negative breast cancer), PC3 (prostate cancer) and A543 (ling cancer) cells resulting in reducing the IC-50 of doxorubicin in vitro. At higher dose, AMP-001 acts as an anti-tumor agent on its own. The synergy between AMP-001 and doxorubicin could pave a new pathway to use AMP-001 as a neoadjuvant to chemotherapy to achieve a better efficacy and reduced off-target toxicity by the current treatments.","Coordinated intra- and inter-organ growth is essential during animal development to generate individuals of proper size and shape. The Drosophila wing has been a valuable model system to reveal the existence of a stress response mechanism mediated by Drosophila p53 (Dmp53) and involved in the coordination of tissue growth between adjacent cell populations upon targeted reduction of growth rates. Here we present evidence that a two-step molecular mechanism is being used by Dmp53 to reduce in a non-autonomous manner growth and proliferation in adjacent cell populations. First, Dmp53-mediated transcriptional induction of Drosophila TNF\u03b1 ligand Eiger leads to cell autonomous activation of JNK. Second, two different signaling events downstream of the Eiger/JNK axis are induced in the growth depleted territory in order to independently regulate tissue size and cell number in adjacent cell populations. Whereas expression of the systemic hormone dILP8 coordinates intra-organ growth and final tissue size, induction of Reactive Oxygen Species downstream of Eiger/JNK and, as a consequence of apoptosis induction, acts non-cell-autonomously to regulate proliferation rates of adjacent epithelial cells. Our results unravel how local and systemic signals can act concertedly to coordinate growth and proliferation within an organ in order to generate well-proportioned organs and functionally integrated adults.","The prevalence of non-alcohol fatty liver disease (NAFLD), defined as the liver\u2019s excessive fat accumulation, continues to increase dramatically. We have recently revealed the molecular mechanism underlying NAFLD using in-depth multi-omics profiling and identified that combined metabolic activators (CMA) could be administered to decrease the amount of hepatic steatosis (HS) in mouse model and NAFLD patients based on systems analysis. Here, we investigated the effects of a CMA including L-carnitine, N-acetyl-l-cysteine, nicotinamide riboside and betaine on a Golden Syrian hamster NAFLD model fed with HFD, and found that HS was decreased with the administration of CMA. To explore the mechanisms involved in the clearance HS, we generated liver transcriptomics data before and after CMA administration, and integrated these data using liver-specific genome-scale metabolic model of liver tissue. We systemically determined the molecular changes after the supplementation of CMAs and found that it activates mitochondria in the liver tissue by modulating the global fatty acid, amino acids, antioxidant and folate metabolism.","Developing drugs for treating Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) has been extremely challenging and costly due to limited knowledge on underlying biological mechanisms and therapeutic targets. Repurposing drugs or their combination has shown potential in accelerating drug development due to the reduced drug toxicity while targeting multiple pathologies. To address the challenge in AD drug development, we developed a multi-task machine learning pipeline to integrate a comprehensive knowledge graph on biological/pharmacological interactions and multi-level evidence on drug efficacy, to identify repurposable drugs and their combination candidates. We developed and computationally validated a heterogeneous graph representation model with transfer learning from universal biomedical databases and with joint optimization with AD risk genes. Using the drug embedding from the heterogeneous graph representation model, we ranked drug candidates based on evidence from post-treatment transcriptomic patterns, mechanistic efficacy in preclinical models, population-based treatment effect, and Phase II/III clinical trials. We experimentally validated the top-ranked candidates in neuronal cells, identifying drug combinations with efficacy in reducing oxidative stress and safety in maintaining neuronal viability and morphology. Our neuronal response experiments confirmed several biologically efficacious drug combinations (e.g., Galantamine + Mifepristone). This pipeline showed that harmonizing heterogeneous and complementary data/knowledge, including human interactome, transcriptome patterns, experimental efficacy, and real-world patient data shed light on the drug development of complex diseases.","Oxidative stress, associated with various neurodegenerative diseases, induces imbalance in ROS generation, impairs cellular antioxidant defences and finally triggers both neurons and astroglial cell death by apoptosis. Astrocytes specifically synthesize and release endozepines, a family of regulatory peptides, including the octadecaneuropeptide (ODN). We have previously reported that ODN is a potent neuroprotective agent that prevents 6-OHDA-induced apoptotic neuronal death. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the potential glioprotective effect of ODN on 6-OHDA-induced oxidative stress and cell death in cultured rat astrocytes. Incubation of astrocytes with graded concentrations of ODN (10\u221214 to 10\u22128 M) inhibited 6-OHDA-evoked cell death in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. In addition, ODN prevented the decrease of mitochondrial activity and caspase-3 activation induced by 6-OHDA. Toxin-treated cells exhibited high level of ROS associated with a generation of H2O2 and O2\u00b0-and a reduction of both SOD and catalase activities. Co-treatment of astrocytes with low concentrations of ODN dose dependently blocked 6-OHDA-evoked ROS production and inhibition of antioxidant enzymes activities. Taken together, these data demonstrate that ODN is a potent glioprotective agent that prevents 6-OHDA-induced oxidative stress and apoptotic cell death. ODN is thus a potential candidate to delay neuronal damages in various pathological conditions involving oxidative neurodegeneration.","Perineuronal Nets (PNNs) are extracellular matrix (ECM) structures that envelop neurons and regulate synaptic functions. Long thought to be stable structures, PNNs have been recently shown to respond dynamically during learning, potentially regulating the formation of new synapses. We postulated that PNNs vary during sleep, a period of active synaptic modification. Notably, PNN components are cleaved by matrix proteases such as the protease cathepsin-S. This protease is diurnally expressed in the mouse cortex, coinciding with dendritic spine density rhythms. Thus, cathepsin-S may contribute to PNN remodeling during sleep, mediating synaptic reorganization. These studies were designed to test the hypothesis that PNN numbers vary in a diurnal manner in the rodent and human brain, as well as in a circadian manner in the rodent brain, and that these rhythms are disrupted by sleep deprivation. In mice, we observed diurnal and circadian rhythms of PNNs labeled with the lectin wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA+PNNs) in several brain regions involved in emotional memory processing. Sleep deprivation prevented the daytime decrease of WFA+ PNNs and enhances fear memory extinction. Diurnal rhythms of cathepsin-S expression in microglia were observed in the same brain regions, opposite to PNN rhythms. Finally, incubation of mouse sections with cathepsin-S eliminated PNN labeling. In humans, WFA+PNNs showed a diurnal rhythm in the amygdala and thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). Our results demonstrate that PNNs vary in a circadian manner and this is disrupted by sleep deprivation. We suggest that rhythmic modification of PNNs may contribute to memory consolidation during sleep.","Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and associated inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) are caused by rod photoreceptor degeneration, necessitating therapeutics promoting rod photoreceptor survival. To address this, we tested compounds for neuroprotective effects in zebrafish and mouse RP models, reasoning drugs effective across species may translate better clinically. We first performed a large-scale phenotypic drug screen using a larval zebrafish model of inducible RP. 2,934 compounds, mostly human-approved drugs, were tested across six concentrations. Statistically, 113 compounds achieved \u201chit\u201d status. Secondary tests of 42 high-priority hits confirmed eleven lead compounds. Nine leads were then evaluated in mouse RP models, with six exhibiting neuroprotective effects. An analysis of potential mechanisms of action suggested complementary activities. Paired lead compound assays in zebrafish showed additive neuroprotective effects for the majority. These results highlight the value of cross-species phenotypic drug discovery and suggest combinatorial drug therapies may provide enhanced therapeutic benefits for patients with RP and IRDs.","Exposure to plant compounds and analogues of juvenile hormone (JH) increase male mating success in several species of tephritid fruit flies. Most of these species exhibit a lek mating system, characterized by active female choice. Although the pattern of enhanced male mating success is evident, few studies have investigated what benefits, if any, females gain via choice of exposed males in the lek mating system. In the South American fruit fly, Anastrepha fraterculus, females mate preferentially with males that were exposed to volatiles released by guava fruit or treated with methoprene (a JH analogue). Here, we tested the hypothesis that female choice confers direct fitness benefits in terms of fecundity and fertility. We first carried out mate choice experiments presenting females with males treated and non-treated with guava volatiles or, alternatively, treated and non-treated with methoprene. After we confirm female preference for treated males, we compared the fecundity and fertility between females mated with treated males and non-treated ones. We found that A. fraterculus females that mated with males exposed to guava volatiles showed higher fecundity than females mated to non-exposed males. On the other hand, females that mated methoprene-treated males showed no evidence of direct benefits. Our findings represent the first evidence of a direct benefit associated to female preference for males that were exposed to host fruit odors in tephritid fruit flies. Differences between the two treatments are discussed in evolutionary and pest management terms.","Genome-wide association studies associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) have implicated pathways related to both lipid homeostasis and innate immunity in the pathophysiology of AD. However, the exact cellular and chemical mediators of neuroinflammation in AD remain poorly understood. The oxysterol 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) is an important immunomodulator produced by peripheral macrophages with wide-ranging effects on cell signaling and innate immunity. Genetic variants of the enzyme responsible for 25-HC production, cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H), have been found to be associated with AD. In the present study, we found that the CH25H expression is upregulated in human AD brain tissue and in transgenic mouse brain tissue bearing amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaques or tau pathology. Treatment with the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) agonist lipopolysaccharide (LPS) markedly upregulates CH25H expression in the mouse brain in vivo. LPS also stimulates CH25H expression and 25-HC secretion in cultured mouse primary microglia. We also found that LPS-induced microglial production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL1\u03b2 is markedly potentiated by 25-HC and attenuated by genetic deletion of CH25H. Microglia expressing apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4), a genetic risk factor for AD, produce greater amounts of 25-HC than apoE3-expressing microglia following treatment with LPS. Remarkably, treatment of microglia with 25-HC results in a much greater level of IL1\u03b2 secretion in LPS-activated apoE4-expressing microglia than in apoE2- or apoE3-expressing microglia. Blocking potassium efflux or inhibiting caspase-1 prevents 25-HC-potentiated IL1\u03b2 release in apoE4-expressing microglia, indicating the involvement of caspase-1/NLRP3 inflammasome activity. 25-HC may function as a microglial secreted inflammatory mediator in brain, promoting IL1\u03b2-mediated neuroinflammation in an apoE isoform-dependent manner (E4\u226bE2/E3) and thus may be an important mediator of neuroinflammation in AD.","The pentose phosphate pathway is a major source of NADPH for oxidative stress resistance in cancer cells but there is limited insight into its role in metastasis, when some cancer cells experience high levels of oxidative stress. To test this, we mutated the substrate binding site of Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), which catalyzes the first step of the pentose phosphate pathway, in patient-derived melanomas. G6PD mutant melanomas had significantly decreased G6PD enzymatic activity and depletion of intermediates in the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway. Reduced G6PD function had little effect on the formation of primary subcutaneous tumors but when these tumors spontaneously metastasized the frequency of circulating melanoma cells in the blood and metastatic disease burden were significantly reduced. G6PD mutant melanomas exhibited increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), decreased NADPH levels, and depleted glutathione as compared to control melanomas. G6PD mutant melanomas compensated for this increase in oxidative stress by increasing the production of NADPH through glutaminolysis. This generated a new metabolic vulnerability as G6PD mutant melanomas were more dependent upon glutamine as compared to control melanomas. The oxidative pentose phosphate pathway and compensatory glutaminolysis thus confer layered protection against oxidative stress during metastasis.","  It is known that the primary source of dietary vitamin C is fruit and\nvegetables and the plasma level of vitamin C has been considered a good\nsurrogate biomarker of vitamin C intake by fruit and vegetable consumption. To\ncombine the information about association between vitamin C intake and the\nplasma level of vitamin C, numerical approximation methods for likelihood\nfunction of correlation coefficient are studied. The least squares approach is\nused to estimate a log-likelihood function by a function from a space of\nB-splines having desirable mathematical properties. The likelihood interval\nfrom the Highest Likelihood Regions (HLR) is used for further inference. This\napproach can be easily extended to the realm of meta-analysis involving sample\ncorrelations from different studies by use of an approximated combined\nlikelihood function. The sample correlations between vitamin C intake and serum\nlevel of vitamin C from many studies are used to illustrate application of this\napproach.\n","Although pentoxifylline (PTX) was identified as a competitive non-selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor, its pharmacological effect has not been clearly elucidated. The present study explored the effect of low dose 10 \u03bcg/mL PTX (therapeutic dose) compared to high dose 300 \u03bcg/mL PTX (experimental dose) in RAW 264.7 cells through immunoprecipitation-based high performance liquid chromatography (IP-HPLC), immunohistochemistry, and western blot. 10 \u03bcg/mL PTX increased the expression of proliferation (Ki-67, PCNA, cyclin D2, cdc25A), epigenetic modification (KDM4D, PCAF), protein translation (DOHH, DHPS, eIF5A1), RAS signaling (KRAS, pAKT1/2/3, PI3K), NFkB signaling (NFkB, GADD45, p38), protection (HSP70, SOD1, GSTO1/2), neuromuscular differentiation (NSE\u03b3, myosin-1a, desmin), osteoblastic differentiation (BMP2, RUNX2, osterix), acute inflammation (TNF\u03b1, IL-1, CXCR4), innate immunity (\u03b2-defensin 1, lactoferrin, TLR-3, -4), cell-mediated immunity (CD4, CD8, CD80), while decreased the expression of ER stress (eIF2\u03b1, eIF2AK3, ATF6\u03b1), fibrosis (FGF2, CTGF, collagen 3A1), and chronic inflammation (CD68, MMP-2, -3, COX2) versus the untreated controls. The activation of proliferation by 10 \u03bcg/mL PTX was also supported by the increase of cMyc-MAX heterodimer and \u03b2-catenin-TCF1 complex in double IP-HPLC. 10 \u03bcg/mL PTX enhanced FAS-mediated apoptosis but diminished p53-mediated apoptosis, and downregulated many angiogenesis proteins (angiogenin, VEGF-A, and FLT4), but upregulated HIF1\u03b1, VEGFR2, and CMG2 reactively. Whereas, 300 \u03bcg/mL PTX consistently decreased proliferation, epigenetic modification, RAS and NFkB signaling, neuromuscular and osteoblastic differentiation, but increased apoptosis, ER stress, and fibrosis compared to 10 \u03bcg/mL PTX. These data suggest PTX has different biological effect on RWA 264.7 cells depending on the concentration of 10 \u03bcg/mL and 300 \u03bcg/mL PTX. The low dose 10 \u03bcg/mL PTX enhanced RAS/NFkB signaling, proliferation, differentiation, and inflammation, particularly, it stimulated neuromuscular and osteoblastic differentiation, innate immunity, and cell-mediated immunity, but attenuated ER stress, fibrosis, angiogenesis, and chronic inflammation, while the high dose 300 \u03bcg/mL PTX was found to alleviate the 10 \u03bcg/mL PTX-induced biological effects, resulted in the suppression of RAS/NFkB signaling, proliferation, neuromuscular and osteoblastic differentiation, and inflammation.","The characteristics of animal products depend on a number of factors linked both to cheese-making technology and to the chemical and microbiological characteristics of the raw material used. These characteristics are themselves dependent on upstream factors (genetic, physiological, or dietary). Those upstream factors have increasingly been the focus of consumers'concern, in particular those related to animal feeding. They take special importance in the case of labelled products (Protected Designation of Origin [PDO], Protected Geographical Indication [PDI], etc.) which claim close links with production conditions. During last years, a number of works have been done to precise, in experimental conditions, the effects of each of these factors on the different dimensions of quality (sensorial, nutritional, hygienic...), as well as their integrated effects when they are observed in a more systemic approach, in the frame of farming systems. Examples from different species (poultry, pork, fish, bovine) are given to illustrate some of these effects.","Colorectal cancer is the second most frequently diagnosed cancer worldwide. Conventional diagnostics methods of colorectal cancer, can detect it in advanced stage.","Obesity is the main component of metabolic syndromes involving distinct etiologies which target different underlying behavioral and physiological functions within the brain structures and neuronal circuits. An alteration in the neuronal circuitry stemming from abdominal or central obesity stimulates a cascade of changes in neurochemical signaling that directly or indirectly mediate spontaneously emitted behaviors such as locomotor activity patterns, anxiety and exploration. Pharmacological agents available for the treatment of neurologic disorders have been associated with limited potency and intolerable adverse effects. These have necessitated the upsurge in utilization of herbal prescriptions due to their affordability, easy accessibility and are firmly embedded within wider belief systems of many people. Gnidia glauca has been used in management of many ailments including obesity and associated symptomatic complications. However, its upsurge in use has not been accompanied with authentication of these folkloric claims. The present study aimed to determine the modulatory effect of Dichloromethane leaf extract of Gnidia glauca on locomotor activity, exploration and anxiety-like behaviors in high fat diet-induced obese rats in an Open Field Arena. Obesity was experimentally induced by feeding the rats with prepared high fat diet and water ad libitum for a period of 6 weeks. The in-vivo anti-obesity effects were determined by oral administration of G. glauca at dosage levels of 200, 250 and 300mg/kg body weight in high fat diet-induced obese rats from the 6th to 12th week. Phytochemical analysis was done using gas chromatography linked to mass spectroscopy. Results indicated that Gnidia glauca showed anxiolytic effects and significantly increased spontaneous locomotor activity and exploration-like behaviors in HFD-induced obese rats. The plant extract also contained phytocompounds that have been associated with amelioration of the main neurodegenerative mediators viz inflammation and oxidative stress. These findings provide \u2018qualified leads\u2019 for the synthesis of new alternative therapeutic agent for management of neurologic disorders. However, there\u2019s need to conduct toxicity studies of Gnidia glauca to establish its safety profiles.","Schwann cell (SC)-specific monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) knockout mice were generated by mating MCT1f/f mice with myelin protein zero (P0)-Cre mice. P0-Cre+/-, MCT1f/f mice have no detectable early developmental defects, but develop hypomyelination and reduced conduction velocity in sensory, but not motor, peripheral nerves during maturation and aging. Furthermore, enlarged node length and reduced mechanical sensitivity were evident in aged P0-Cre+/-, MCT1f/f mice. MCT1 deletion in SCs impairs both their glycolytic and mitochondrial functions, leading to altered lipid metabolism of triacylglycerides, diacylglycerides, and sphingomyelin, decreased expression of myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), and increased expression of c-Jun and p75-neurotrophin receptor, suggesting a regression of SCs to a less mature developmental state. Taken together, our results define the essential role of SC MCT1 in both SC metabolism and peripheral nerve maturation and aging.","Phylloquinone is a lipophilic naphthoquinone found predominantly in chloroplasts and best known for its function in photosystem I electron transport and disulfide bridge formation of photosystem II subunits. Phylloquinone has also been detected in plasma membrane preparations of heterotrophic tissues with potential transmembrane redox function, but the molecular basis for this noncanonical pathway is unknown. Here we provide evidence of plasma membrane phylloquinone biosynthesis in a nonphotosynthetic holoparasite Phelipanche aegyptiaca. A nonphotosynthetic and nonplastidial role for phylloquinone is supported by transcription of phylloquinone biosynthetic genes during seed germination and haustorium development, by plasma membrane-localization of alternative terminal enzymes, and by detection of phylloquinone in germinated seeds. Comparative gene network analysis with photosynthetically competent parasites revealed a bias of Phelipanche phylloquinone genes toward coexpression with oxidoreductases involved in plasma membrane electron transport. Genes encoding the plasma membrane phylloquinone pathway are also present in several photoautotrophic taxa of Asterids, suggesting an ancient origin of multifunctionality. Our findings suggest that nonphotosynthetic holoparasites exploit alternative targeting of phylloquinone for transmembrane redox signaling associated with parasitism.","Platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) have been investigated for their antioxidant abilities in a range of biological and other applications. The ability to reduce off-target CAP cytotoxicity would be useful in Plasma Medicine, however, little has been published to date about the ability of PtNPs to reduce or inhibit the effects of CAP. Here we investigate whether PtNPs can protect against CAP-induced cytotoxicity in cancerous and non-cancerous cell lines. PtNPs were shown to dramatically reduce intracellular reactive species (RONS) production in human U-251 MG cells. However, RONS generation was unaffected by PtNPs in medium without cells. PtNPs protect against CAP induced mitochondrial membrane depolarization, but not cell membrane permeabilization which is a CAP-induced RONS-independent event. PtNPs act as potent intracellular scavengers of reactive species and can protect both cancerous U-251 MG cells and non-cancerous HEK293 cells against CAP induced cytotoxicity. PtNPs may be useful as a catalytic antioxidant for healthy tissue and for protecting against CAP-induced tissue damage.","Current targeted cancer therapies are largely guided by mutations of a single gene, which overlooks concurrent genomic alterations. Here, we show that RNASEH2B, RB1, and BRCA2, three closely located genes on chromosome 13q, are frequently deleted in prostate cancer individually or jointly. Loss of RNASEH2B confers cancer cells sensitivity to poly(ADP\u2013ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition due to impaired ribonucleotide excision repair and PARP trapping. When co-deleted with RB1, however, cells lose their sensitivity, in part, through E2F1-induced BRCA2 expression, thereby enhancing homologous recombination repair capacity. Nevertheless, loss of BRCA2 re-sensitizes RNASEH2B/RB1 co-deleted cells to PARP inhibition. Our results may explain some of the disparate clinical results from PARP inhibition due to interaction between multiple genomic alterations and support a comprehensive genomic testing to determine who may benefit from PARP inhibition. Finally, we show that ATR inhibition can disrupt E2F1-induced BRCA2 expression and overcome PARP inhibitor resistance caused by RB1 loss.","Although a defective vitamin D pathway has been widely suspected to be associated in SARS-CoV-2 pathobiology, the status of the vitamin D pathway and vitamin D-modulated genes in lung cells of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown. To understand the significance of the vitamin D pathway in SARS-CoV-2 pathobiology, computational approaches were applied to transcriptomic datasets from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cells of such patients or healthy individuals. Levels of vitamin D receptor, retinoid X receptor, and CYP27A1 in BALF cells of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 were found to be reduced. Additionally, 107 differentially expressed, predominantly downregulated genes modulated by vitamin D were identified in transcriptomic datasets from patient\u2019s cells. Further analysis of differentially expressed genes provided eight novel genes with a conserved motif with vitamin D-responsive elements, implying the role of both direct and indirect mechanisms of gene expression by the dysregulated vitamin D pathway in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Network analysis of differentially expressed vitamin D-modulated genes identified pathways in the immune system, NF-KB/cytokine signaling, and cell cycle regulation as top predicted pathways that might be affected in the cells of such patients. In brief, the results provided computational evidence to implicate a dysregulated vitamin D pathway in the pathobiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Traditional drug design focus on specific target (s) expressed by cancer cells. However, cancer cells outsmart the interventions by activating survival pathways and/or downregulating cell death pathways. As the research in molecular biology of cancer grows exponentially, new methods of drug designs are needed to target multiple pathways/targets which are involved in survival of cancer cells. Vitamin E analogues including a-tocopheryl succinate (\u03b1-TOS) is a well-known anti-tumoregenic agent which is well studied both in vitro and in vivo tumor models. However, lack of targeting cancer cells and unexpected toxicity along with the poor water solubility of \u03b1-TOS compelled a rational drug design using both targeting and cleavable technologies incorporated in the new drug design. A plethora of Vitamin E derivatives (AMP-001, 002 and 003) were synthesized, characterized and studied for the improved efficacy and lowered toxicity in various cancer cells in vitro. Preliminary studies revealed AAAPT leading candidates reduced the invasive potential of brain tumor stem cells, synergized with different drugs and different treatments. AAAPT leading drug AMP-001 enhanced the therapeutic index of front-line drug Doxorubicin in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) tumor rat model preserving the ventricular function when used as a neoadjuvant to Doxorubicin. These results may pave the way for reducing the cardiotoxicity of chemotherapy in clinical settings.","Discovery of novel natural products is an accepted method for the elucidation of pharmacologically active molecules and drug leads. Best known sources for such discovery have been terrestrial plants and microbes, accounting for about 85% of the approved natural products in pharmaceutical use (1), and about 60% of approved pharmaceuticals and new drug applications annually (2). Discovery in the marine environment has lagged due to the difficulty of exploration in this ecological niche. Exploration began in earnest in the 1950\u2019s, after technological advances such as scuba diving allowed collection of marine organisms, primarily at a depth to about 15m.","Prior knowledge of perturbation data can significantly assist in inferring the relationship between chemical perturbations and their specific transcriptional response. However, current databases mostly contain cancer cell lines, which are unsuitable for the aforementioned inference in non-cancer cells. Here we present ChemPert (https://chempert.uni.lu/), a database consisting of 82270 transcriptional signatures across 167 non-cancer cell types, enabling more accurate predictions of perturbation responses and drugs compared to cancer databases in non-cancer cells. In particular, ChemPert correctly predicted drug effects for treating non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and novel drugs for osteoarthritis. Overall, ChemPert provides a valuable resource for drug discovery in non-cancer diseases.","Background Reprogramming of somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and subsequent differentiation into iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iCM) seems to be a promising strategy for cardiac regenerative therapy. However, recent failure or poor outcomes in cardiac cell therapy warrants further investigation focusing on the infarction/wound environment (site of healing) to improve the cardiac regenerative medicine. Here, using next generation sequencing (NGS), we analyzed the global transcriptome to discover the unidentified genes/pathways that are crucial for cell survival, cytoprotection and mitochondrial dynamics during the differentiation of iPSC into iCM.","The contributions of skeletal cells to the processes of B cell development in the bone marrow (BM) have not been completely described. The von-Hippel Lindau protein (VHL) plays a key role in cellular responses to hypoxia. Previous work showed that Dmp1-Cre;Vhl conditional knockout mice (VhlcKO), which delete Vhl in late osteoblasts and osteocytes, display dysregulated bone growth and reduction in B cells. Here, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the B cell defects using flow cytometry and high-resolution imaging. In the VhlcKO BM, B cell progenitors were increased in frequency and number, whereas Hardy Fractions B-F were decreased. VhlcKO Fractions B-C cells showed increased apoptosis and quiescence. Reciprocal BM chimeras confirmed a B cell-extrinsic source of the VhlcKO B cell defects. In support of this, VhlcKO BM serum contained reduced CXCL12 and elevated EPO levels. Staining of VhlcKO B cells with an intracellular hypoxic marker indicated the natural existence of distinct B cell microenvironments that differ in local oxygen tensions. Additionally, intravital and ex vivo imaging revealed VhlcKO BM blood vessels with increased diameter, frequency, volume, and a diminished blood-BM barrier. Our studies identify novel mechanisms linking altered bone homeostasis with drastic BM microenvironmental changes that dysregulate B cell development.","The chemopreventive activity of celecoxib against colorectal cancer is limited to a proportion of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients who experience a response. The cause of this response variability and the potential mechanisms underlying these responses remain poorly understood. Preclinical studies showed that celecoxib increases the production of main oxidative metabolism product of linoleic acid, 13-S-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-S-HODE), to suppress colorectal tumorigenesis. We conducted a phase II clinical study to determine whether celecoxib increases 13-S-HODE production in colonic adenomas from FAP patients. Twenty seven FAP patients completed a 6-month oral course of 400 mg of celecoxib twice a day and had colonoscopies before and after celecoxib treatment to assess colorectal polyp tumor burden and obtain colorectal normal and polyp biopsies to measure celecoxib, 13-HODE, 15-HETE, 12-HETE, and LTB4 levels by LC/MS. Celecoxib levels in sera from those patients were also measured before treatment and 2, 4, and 6 months of treatment. Seventeen of the 27 patients experienced a response to celecoxib, with a more than 30% reduction of colonic polyp burden on the basis of a reproducible quantitative assessment of colonoscopy results. Celecoxib levels were significantly lower in polyp tissues than in normal colorectal tissues. Celecoxib levels in sera and normal colorectal tissues were correlated in patients who experienced a response to celecoxib but not in those who did not. Among the measured lipoxygenase products, only 13-HODE levels were significantly lower in polyp tissues than in normal tissues. Our findings demonstrate the differential bioavailability of celecoxib between normal and polyp tissues and its potential effects on clinical response in FAP patients.","Oxidative stress is a hallmark of numerous airway diseases, contributing to extensive cell and tissue damage. Cell membranes and the airway mucosal lining are rich in phospholipids that are particularly susceptible to oxidative attack, producing bioactive molecules including oxidized phosphatidylcholines (OxPC). With the recent discovery of elevated OxPC in asthmatic patients after allergen challenge, we hypothesized that OxPC directly contribute to disease by inducing airway epithelial cell dysfunction.","Ageing is the primary risk factor for AD; however, there is a poor understanding of the biological mechanisms by which the ageing process contributes to the development of AD in some individuals, while others progress to advanced age with relatively little AD neuropathology. To halt the progression of AD, the preclinical stage of neurodegeneration (before the onset of clinical symptoms) is anticipated to be the more effective time point for applying potentially disease-modifying interventions in AD. The main objective of this study was to understand the age and disease related proteomic changes are detectable in plasma, based on retrospective analysis of longitudinal data and cross-sectional analyses of clinically diagnosed cases. We conducted an in-depth plasma proteomics analysis using intensive depletion of high-abundant plasma proteins using the Agilent multiple affinity removal liquid chromatography (LC) column-Human 14 (Hu14) followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS PAGE) technique. In this study, we have begun to address the following questions; (1) differences in plasma proteomic profiles between normal ageing, vs ageing with progress to cognitive decline (MCI) or disease (dementia, probable AD), (2) cross-sectional analysis of baseline data, when all subjects are clinically identified as cognitively normal, provides insight into the preclinical changes which precede subsequent progression to AD and potentially provide early biomarkers, and (3) comparison of plasma at the point of progression to clinically diagnosed onset of cognitive decline or AD, can provide potential plasma biomarkers to facilitate clinical diagnosis. Furthermore, our findings also identified some proteins previously discovered in AD CSF and brain proteomics signatures that could provide clinically meaningful information. We identified differentially expressed proteins which were associated with several biological and molecular processes that may serve as therapeutic targets and fluid biomarkers for the disease.","Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been put forward as neurobiologically plausible models of the visual hierarchy. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, CNN representations of visual stimuli have previously been shown to correspond to processing stages in the ventral and dorsal streams of the visual system. Whether this correspondence between models and brain signals also holds for activity acquired at high temporal resolution has been explored less exhaustively. Here, we addressed this question by combining CNN-based encoding models with magnetoencephalography (MEG). Human participants passively viewed 1000 images of objects while MEG signals were acquired. We modelled their high temporal resolution source-reconstructed cortical activity with CNNs, and observed a feedforward sweep across the visual hierarchy between 75-200 ms after stimulus onset. This spatiotemporal cascade was captured by the network layer representations, where the increasingly abstract stimulus representation in the hierarchical network model was reflected in different parts of the visual cortex, following the visual ventral stream. We further validated the accuracy of our encoding model by decoding stimulus identity in a left-out validation set of viewed objects, achieving state-of-the-art decoding accuracy.","Background Hospitalized neonates receive the highest number of drugs compared to all other age groups, but consumption rates vary between studies depending on patient characteristics and local practices. There are no large scale international studies on drug use in neonatal units. We aimed to describe drug use in European neonatal units and characterize its associations with geographic region and gestational age (GA).","Background We explored whether the effects of nilvadipine on cognition were influenced by baseline Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) severity.","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a neurodegenerative disease preferentially affecting motoneurones. Transgenic mouse models have been used to investigate the role of abnormal motoneurone excitability in this disease. Whilst an increased excitability has repeatedly been demonstrated in vitro in neonatal and embryonic preparations from SOD1 mouse models, the results from the only studies to record in vivo from spinal motoneurones in adult SOD1 models have produced conflicting findings. Deficits in repetitive firing have been reported in G93A SOD1 mice but not in presymptomatic G127X SOD1 mice despite shorter motoneurone axon initial segments (AISs) in these mice.","The selenoprotein thioredoxin reductase 1 (TXNRD1) plays a central role in ameliorating oxidative stress. Inhibition of TXNRD1 has been explored as a means of killing cancer cells that are thought to develop an enhanced reliance on such antioxidant proteins. In the context of ferroptosis, a non-apoptotic form of oxidative cell death, TXNRD1 has been proposed to cooperate with the phospholipid hydroperoxidase enzyme glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) to protect cells from the lethal accumulation of lipid peroxides. Here, we report our unexpected finding that in pancreatic cancer cells, CRISPR\u2013Cas9-mediated loss of TXNRD1 confers protection from ferroptosis induced by small-molecule inhibition of GPX4. Insights stemming from mechanistic interrogation of this phenomenon suggest that loss of TXNRD1 results in increased levels of GPX4 protein, potentially by influencing availability of selenocysteine, a scarce amino acid required by both proteins for proper synthesis and function. Increased abundance of GPX4 protein, in turn, protects cells from the effects of small-molecule GPX4 inhibition. These findings implicate selenoprotein regulation in governing ferroptosis sensitivity. Furthermore, by delineating a relationship between GPX4 and TXNRD1 contrary to that observed in numerous other settings, our discoveries underscore the context-specific nature of ferroptosis circuitry and its modulators.","Ascorbate (vitamin C) is an essential micronutrient in humans. The chronic severe deficiency of ascorbate, termed scurvy, has long been associated with increased susceptibility to infections. How ascorbate affects the immune system at the cellular and molecular levels remained unclear. Here, from a micronutrient screen, we identified ascorbate as a potent enhancer for antibody response by facilitating the IL-21/STAT3-dependent plasma cell differentiation in mouse and human B cells. The effect of ascorbate is unique, as other antioxidants failed to promote plasma cell differentiation. Ascorbate is critical during early B cell activation by poising the cells to plasma cell lineage without affecting the proximal IL-21/STAT3 signaling and the overall transcriptome. Consistent with its role as a cofactor for epigenetic enzymes, ascorbate potentiates plasma cell differentiation by remodeling the epigenome via TET (Ten Eleven Translocation), the enzymes responsible for DNA demethylation by oxidizing 5-methylcytosines into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). Genome-wide 5hmC profiling identified ascorbate responsive elements (EAR) at the Prdm1 locus, including a distal element with a STAT3 motif overlapped with a CpG that was methylated and modified by TET in the presence of ascorbate. The results suggest that an adequate level of VC is required for antibody response and highlight how micronutrients regulate the activity of epigenetic enzymes to regulate gene expression. Our findings imply that epigenetic enzymes can function as sensors to gauge the availability of metabolites and influence cell fate decisions.","Zika virus is a global public health emergency due to its association with microcephaly, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, neuropathy, and myelitis in children and adults. A total of 87 countries have had evidence of autochthonous mosquito-borne transmission of Zika virus, distributed across four continents, and no antivirus therapy or vaccines are available. Therefore, several strategies have been developed to target the main mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti, to reduce the burden of different arboviruses. Among such strategies, the use of the maternally-inherited endosymbiont Wolbachia pipientis has been applied successfully to reduce virus susceptibility and decrease transmission. However, the mechanisms by which Wolbachia orchestrate resistance to ZIKV infection remain to be elucidated. In this study, we apply isobaric labeling quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics to quantify proteins and identify pathways altered during ZIKV infection; Wolbachia infection; co-infection with Wolbachia/ZIKV in the Ae. aegypti heads and salivary glands. We show that Wolbachia regulates proteins involved in ROS production, regulates humoral immune response, and antioxidant production. The reduction of ZIKV polyprotein in the presence of Wolbachia in mosquitoes was determined by mass spectrometry and corroborates the idea that Wolbachia helps to block ZIKV infections in Ae. aegypti. The present study offers a rich resource of data that may help to elucidate mechanisms by which Wolbachia orchestrate resistance to ZIKV infection in Ae. aegypti, and represents a step further on the development of new targeted methods to detect and quantify ZIKV and Wolbachia directly in complex tissues.","Osteoarthritis (OA) is characterised by loss of articular cartilage, synovial membrane dysfunction and subchondral sclerosis. Few studies have used a global approach to stratify equine synovial fluid (SF) molecular profiles according to OA severity. SF was collected from 58 metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and metatarsophalangeal joints of racing Thoroughbred horses (Hong Kong Jockey Club; HKJC) and 83 MCP joints of mixed breed horses from an abattoir and equine hospital (biobank). Joints were histologically and macroscopically assessed for OA severity. For proteomic analysis, native SF and SF loaded onto ProteoMiner\u2122 equalisation columns, to deplete high abundant proteins, were analysed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and label-free quantification. Validation of selected differentially expressed proteins was undertaken using clinical SF collected during diagnostic investigations. Native SF metabolites were analysed using 1D 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). 1,834 proteins and 40 metabolites were identified in equine SF. Afamin levels decreased with synovitis severity and four uncharacterised proteins decreased with OA severity. Gelsolin and lipoprotein binding protein decreased with OA severity and apolipoprotein A1 levels increased for mild and moderate OA. Within the biobank, glutamate levels decreased with OA severity and for the HKJC cohort, 2-aminobutyrate, alanine and creatine increased with severity. Proteomic and metabolomic integration was undertaken using linear regression via Lasso penalisation modelling, incorporating 29 variables (R2=0.82) with principal component 2 able to discriminate advanced OA from earlier stages, predominantly driven by H9GZQ9, F6ZR63 and alanine. Combining biobank and HKJC datasets, discriminant analysis of principal components modelling prediction was good for mild OA (90%). This study has stratified equine OA using both metabolomic and proteomic SF profiles and identified a panel of markers of interest which may be applicable to grading OA severity. This is also the first study to undertake computational integration of NMR metabolomic and LC-MS/MS proteomic datasets of any biological system.","The present study aimed to investigate the protective effect of \u03b2-carotene on the oxidative stress injury of human normal colon cell line CCD-18Co triggered by tert-Butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP). XTT examination was used to determine cell viability after \u03b2-carotene supplementation and to determine the optimal concentration of antioxidant in spectroscopic studies. Cell biochemistry for CCD-18Co control group, after tBHP adding and for cells in \u03b2-carotene - tBHP model was studied by using label-free Raman microspectroscopy. Results for stress treated CCD-18Co human colon normal cells and human colon cancer cells Caco-2 based on vibration features were also compared. Pretreatment with \u03b2-carotene alleviated damages in CCD-18Co human normal colon cells induced by tBHP and showed the preventative effect on cells apoptosis. Treatment with \u03b2-carotene altered the level of ROS investigated based on intensities of Raman peaks typical for lipids, proteins and nucleic acids. Presented study confirmed the antioxidant, protective role of \u03b2-carotene against ROS by using spectroscopic label-free Raman techniques.","We have described for the first time the potential harmful effects of green tea on the metabolism and body composition of untreated juvenile experimental type 1 diabetic rats. The treatment containing 19.38% of epigallocatechin-3-gallate, its main catechin, increased blood glucose and water intake. It also increased oxygen consumption, enhanced energy expenditure and led to a lipid oxidation tendency in diabetic animals, which worsened the development of body fat in a way significantly more aggravated than diabetes alone. Taken together, our findings indicate that green tea treatment, when provided to juvenile diabetics, increases glycaemia, changes the body composition by reducing fat content and increases oxygen consumption, besides affecting energy expenditure. Therefore, the nutritional status of the juvenile type 1 diabetic rat is aggravated.","Cells can help each other replicate by communicating with diffusible molecules. In cell cultures, molecules may diffuse within a cell colony or between adjacent or distant colonies. Determining which cell helps which cell\u2019s replication is challenging. We developed a systematic approach, integrating modeling and experiments, for determining the length-scales of cell-cell communication (from microns to centimeters). With this approach, we discovered that differentiating murine ES cells, scattered across centimeters on a dish, communicate over millimeters to form one macroscopic entity that survives if and only if its centimeter-scale population-density is above a threshold value. Single-cell-level measurements, transcriptomics, and modeling revealed that this \u201cmacroscopic quorum sensing\u201d arises from differentiating ES cells secreting and sensing survival-promoting FGF4 that diffuses over millimeters and activates YAP1-induced survival mechanisms. Through the same mechanism, a lone macroscopic, but not microscopic, colony survives differentiation. Our work rigorously establishes that in vitro ES-cell differentiation relies on macroscopic cooperation.","Single-cell transcriptomics provide a systematic map of gene expression in different human cell types. The next challenge is to systematically understand cell-type specific gene function. The integration of CRISPR-based functional genomics and stem cell technology enables the scalable interrogation of gene function in differentiated human cells. Here, we present the first genomewide CRISPR interference and CRISPR activation screens in human neurons.","Large-scale mutant libraries have been indispensable for genetic studies, and the development of next-generation genome sequencing technologies has greatly advanced efforts to analyze mutants. In this work, we sequenced the genomes of 660 Chlamydomonas reinhardtii acetate-requiring mutants, part of a larger photosynthesis mutant collection previously generated by insertional mutagenesis with a linearized plasmid. We identified 554 insertion events from 509 mutants by mapping the plasmid insertion sites through paired-end sequences, in which one end aligned to the plasmid and the other to a chromosomal location. Nearly all (96%) of the events were associated with deletions, duplications, or more complex rearrangements of genomic DNA at the sites of plasmid insertion, and 1405 genes in total were affected. Functional annotations of these genes were enriched in those related to photosynthesis, signaling, and tetrapyrrole synthesis as would be expected from a library enriched for photosynthesis mutants. Systematic manual analysis of the disrupted genes for each mutant generated a list of 273 higher-confidence candidate photosynthesis genes, and we experimentally validated two genes that are essential for photoautotrophic growth, CrLPA3 and CrPSBP4. The inventory of candidate genes includes 55 genes from a phylogenomically defined set of conserved genes in green algae and plants. Altogether, 68 candidate genes encode proteins with previously characterized functions in photosynthesis in Chlamydomonas, land plants, and/or cyanobacteria, 15 genes encode proteins previously shown to have functions unrelated to photosynthesis, and 190 genes encode proteins without any functional annotation, signifying that our results connect a function related to photosynthesis to these previously unknown proteins. This mutant library, with genome sequences that reveal the molecular extent of the chromosomal lesions and resulting higher-confidence candidate genes, represents a rich resource for gene discovery and protein functional analysis in photosynthesis.","Nutritional intervention is becoming more prevalent as adjuvant therapy for many cancers in view of the tumor dependence on external sources for some nutrients. We report the dependence of glioma cells on exogenous cysteine/cystine, despite this amino acid being nonessential. 13C-tracing and the analysis of cystathionine synthase and cystathioninase levels revealed the metabolic landscape attributable to cysteine deprivation, and the disconnection between the methionine cycle and the transsulfuration pathway. Therefore, we explored the nutritional deprivation in a mouse model of glioma. Animals subjected to a cysteine/cystine-free diet survived longer, with concomitant reductions in glutathione and cysteine plasma levels. At the end point, however, tumors displayed the ability to synthesize glutathione, although higher levels of oxidative stress were detected. We observed a compensation from the nutritional intervention revealed as the recovery of cysteine-related metabolites in plasma. Our study highlights a time window where cysteine deprivation can be exploited for additional therapeutic strategies.","Head motion is a common problem in clinical as well as empirical (functional) Magnetic Resonance Imaging applications, as it can lead to severe artefacts that reduce image quality. The scanned individuals themselves, however, are often not aware of their head motion. The current study explored whether providing subjects with this information using tactile feedback would reduce their head motion and consequently improve image quality. In a single session that included six runs, 24 participants performed three different cognitive tasks: (1) passive viewing, (2) mental imagery, and (3) speeded responses. These tasks occurred in two different conditions: (a) with a strip of medical tape applied from one side of the MR head-coil, via the participant\u2019s forehead, to the other side, and (b) without the medical tape being applied. Results revealed that application of medical tape to the forehead of subjects to provide tactile feedback significantly reduced both translational as well as rotational head motion. While this effect did not differ between the three cognitive tasks, there was a negative quadratic relationship between head motion with and without feedback. That is, the more head motion a subject produced without feedback, the stronger the motion reduction given the feedback. In conclusion, the here tested method provides a simple and cost-efficient way to reduce subjects\u2019 head motion, and might be especially beneficial when extensive head motion is expected a priori.","Caveolae have been linked to many biological functions, but their precise roles are unclear. Using quantitative whole cell proteomics of genome-edited cells, we show that the oxidative stress response is the major pathway dysregulated in cells lacking the key caveola structural protein, CAVIN1. CAVIN1 deletion compromised sensitivity to oxidative stress in cultured cells and in animals. Wound-induced accumulation of reactive oxygen species and apoptosis were suppressed in Cavin1-null zebrafish, negatively affecting regeneration. Oxidative stress triggered lipid peroxidation and induced caveolar disassembly. The resulting release of CAVIN1 from caveolae allowed direct interaction between CAVIN1 and NRF2, a key regulator of the antioxidant response, facilitating NRF2 degradation. CAVIN1-null cells with impaired negative regulation of NRF2 showed resistance to lipid peroxidation-induced ferroptosis. Thus, caveolae, via lipid peroxidation and CAVIN1 release, maintain cellular susceptibility to oxidative stress-induced cell death demonstrating a crucial role for this enigmatic organelle in cellular homeostasis and wound response.","Cancer cells show a bias toward the glycolytic system over the conventional mitochondrial electron transfer system for obtaining energy. This biased metabolic adaptation is called the Warburg effect. Cancer cells also exhibit a characteristic metabolism, a decreased heme synthesizing ability. Here we show that heme synthesis and the Warburg effect are inversely correlated. We used human gastric cancer cell lines to investigate glycolytic metabolism and electron transfer system toward promotion/inhibition of heme synthesis. Under hypoxic conditions, heme synthesis was suppressed and the glycolytic system was enhanced. Addition of a heme precursor for the promotion of heme synthesis led to an enhanced electron transfer system and inhibited the glycolytic system and vice versa. Enhanced heme synthesis leads to suppression of cancer cell proliferation by increasing intracellular reactive oxygen species levels. Collectively, the promotion of heme synthesis in cancer cells eliminated the Warburg effect by shifting energy metabolism from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation.","Human Tim8a is a member of an intermembrane space chaperone network, known as the small TIM family, which transport hydrophobic membrane proteins through this compartment. Mutations in TIMM8A cause a neurodegenerative disease, Mohr-Tranebj\u00e6rg syndrome (MTS), which is characterised by sensorineural hearing loss, dystonia and blindness. Nothing is known about the function of hTim8a in neuronal cells and consequently how lack of hTim8a leads to a neurodegenerative disease. We identified a novel cell-specific function of hTim8a in the assembly of Complex IV, which is mediated through a transient interaction with the copper chaperone COX17. Complex IV assembly defects in cells lacking hTim8a leads to oxidative stress and changes to key apoptotic regulators, including cytochrome c and Bax, which primes cells for cell death. Alleviation of oxidative stress using Vitamin E rescues cells from apoptotic vulnerability. We hypothesis that enhanced sensitivity of neuronal cells to apoptosis is the underlying mechanism of MTS.","Id proteins are helix-loop-helix (HLH) transcriptional regulators frequently overexpressed in cancer. Id proteins inhibit basic HLH transcription factors through protein-protein interactions, often inhibiting differentiation and sustaining proliferation. We recently identified a small-molecule, AGX51, which targets Id proteins for degradation and impairs ocular neovascularization in mouse models. Here we show that AGX51 treatment of cancer cell lines impaired cell growth and viability that results from a dramatic increase in ROS production upon Id degradation. In mouse models, AGX51 treatment suppressed breast cancer colonization in the lung, regressed the growth of paclitaxel-resistant breast tumors when combined with paclitaxel and reduced tumor burden in a model of sporadic colorectal neoplasia. Furthermore, in cells and mice, we failed to observe acquired resistance to AGX51 likely the result of the immutability of the binding pocket and efficient degradation of the Id proteins. Thus, AGX51 is a first-in-class compound that antagonizes Id proteins, shows strong anti-tumor effects and may be further developed for the management of multiple cancers.","Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive cancer of the thorax with a median survival of one year. We constructed an \u2018MPM interactome\u2019 with over 300 computationally predicted PPIs and over 1300 known PPIs of 62 literature-curated genes whose activity affects MPM. Known PPIs of the 62 MPM associated genes were derived from BioGRID and HPRD databases. Novel PPIs were predicted by applying the HiPPIP algorithm, which computes features of protein pairs such as cellular localization, molecular function, biological process membership, genomic location of the gene, gene expression in microarray experiments, protein domains and tissue membership, and classifies the pairwise features as interacting or non-interacting based on a random forest model. To our satisfaction, the interactome is significantly enriched with genes differentially expressed in MPM tumors compared with normal pleura, and with other thoracic tumors. The interactome is also significantly enriched with genes whose high expression has been correlated with unfavorable prognosis in lung cancer, and with genes differentially expressed on crocidolite exposure. 28 of the interactors of MPM proteins are targets of 147 FDA-approved drugs. By comparing differential expression profiles induced by drug to profiles induced by MPM, potentially repurposable drugs are identified from this drug list. Development of PPIs of disease-specific set of genes is a powerful approach with high translational impact \u2013 the interactome is a vehicle to piece together an integrated view on how genes associated with MPM through various high throughput studies are functionally linked, leading to clinically translatable results such as clinical trials with repurposed drugs. The PPIs are made available on a webserver, called Wiki-Pi MPM at http://severus.dbmi.pitt.edu/wiki-MPM with advanced search capabilities.","Membrane contact sites between organelles are organized by protein bridges. Among the components of these contacts, the VAP family comprises endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-anchored proteins, such as MOSPD2, functioning as major ER-organelle tethers. MOSPD2 distinguishes itself from the other members of the VAP family by the presence of a CRAL-TRIO domain. In this study, we show that MOSPD2 forms ER-LD contacts thanks to its CRAL-TRIO domain. MOSPD2 ensures the attachment of the ER to LDs through a direct protein-membrane interaction involving an amphipathic helix that has an affinity for lipid packing defects present at the surface of LDs. Remarkably, the absence of MOSPD2 markedly disturbs the assembly of lipid droplets. These data show that MOSPD2, in addition to being a general ER receptor for inter-organelle contacts, possesses an additional tethering activity and is specifically implicated in the biology of LDs via its CRAL-TRIO domain.","Alpha activity (8\u201314 Hz) is the dominant rhythm in the awake brain, and thought to play an important role in setting the brain\u2019s internal state. Previous work has associated states of decreased alpha power with enhanced neural excitability. However, evidence is mixed on whether and how such excitability enhancement modulates sensory signals of interest versus noise differently, and what, if any, the consequences are for subsequent perception. Here, human subjects (male and female) performed a visual detection task in which we manipulated their decision criteria in a block-wise manner. While our manipulation led to substantial criterion shifts, these shifts were not reflected in pre-stimulus alpha-band changes. Rather, lower pre-stimulus alpha power in occipital-parietal areas improved perceptual sensitivity and enhanced information content decodable from neural activity patterns. Additionally, oscillatory alpha phase immediately before stimulus presentation modulated accuracy. Together, our results suggest that alpha-band dynamics modulate sensory signals of interest more strongly than noise.","Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked progressive muscle disorder, caused by mutations in the Dystrophin gene. Cardiomyopathy is one of the major causes of early death. In this study, we used DMD patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to model cardiomyopathic features in DMD and unravel novel pathological mechanistic insights. Cardiomyocytes (CMs) differentiated from DMD iPSCs showed enhanced premature cell death, due to significantly elevated intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentrations, as a result of depolarized mitochondria and high NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) protein levels. Genetic correction of Dystrophin through CRISPR/Cas9 editing restored normal ROS levels. Application of ROS reduction by N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), partial Dystrophin re-expression by ataluren (PTC124) and enhancing mitochondrial electron transport chain function by idebenone improved cell survival of DMD iPSC-CMs. We show applications that could counteract the detrimental oxidative stress environment in DMD iPSC-CMs by stimulating adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. ATP could bind to the ATP-binding domain in the NOX4 enzyme, and we demonstrate that ATP resulted in partial inhibition of the NADPH-dependent ROS production of NOX4.","Neuroblastoma is the most common solid tumour in childhood and prognosis remains poor for high-risk cases despite the use of multimodal treatment. Analysis of public drug sensitivity data showed neuroblastoma lines to be particularly sensitive to indisulam, a molecular glue that selectively targets RNA splicing factor RBM39 for proteosomal degradation via DCAF15-E3-ubiquitin ligase. In neuroblastoma models, indisulam induced rapid loss of RBM39, accumulation of splicing errors and growth inhibition in a DCAF15- dependent manner. Integrative analysis of RNAseq and proteomics data highlighted a distinct disruption to cell cycle and metabolism. Metabolic profiling demonstrated metabolome perturbations and mitochondrial dysfunction resulting from indisulam. Complete tumour without relapse was observed in both xenografts and the Th-MYCN transgenic model of neuroblastoma after indisulam treatment, with RBM39 loss confirmed in vivo. Our data imply that dual targeting of metabolism and RNA splicing with anti-cancer sulphonamides such as indisulam is a promising therapeutic approach for high-risk neuroblastoma.","The plant growth promoting bacterium (PGPB) Bacillus pumilus TUAT-1 is an indole acetic acid producer that can increase plant growth. Inoculation with this strain has been shown to confer greater plant tolerance to drought and saline conditions. Although the ability of TUAT-1 to enhance plant growth is well documented, little is known about what mechanisms underlie the plant response to this bacterium. Applying genome-wide association study (GWAS), we evaluated the interaction between TUAT-1 and Arabidopsis thaliana, screening 288 plant ecotypes for root architecture traits comparing non-inoculated and inoculated plants. Most of the ecotypes were significantly affected by TUAT-1 inoculation (66.7%) for at least one of the root traits measured. For example, some ecotypes responded positively increasing root growth while others showed reduced growth upon inoculation. A total of 96 ecotypes (33.3%) did not respond significantly to PGPB inoculation. These results are consistent with the widely reported strain-genotype specificity shown in many plant-microbe interactions. The GWAS analysis revealed significant SNPs associated to specific root traits leading to identification of several genes putatively involved in enabling the Bacillus pumilus TUAT-1 and A. thaliana association and contributing to plant growth promotion. Our results show that root architecture features are genetic separable traits associated with plant growth in association with TUAT-1. Our findings validate previous reported genes involved in Bacillus spp.-plant interaction, growth promotion and highlight potential genes involved in plant microbe interaction. We suggest that plant-bacterial interaction and the plant growth promotion are quantitative and multigenic traits. This knowledge expands our understanding of the functional mechanisms driving plant growth promotion by PGPB.","Immunosenescence, oxidative stress, and low vaccine efficacy are important symptoms of aging. The goal of our study was to see if quercetin had anti-aging and stimulating effects on PBMC immune cells in vitro. In the presence of concanavalin a, PBMCs were isolated from healthy elderly and young people and cultured in a complete RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with quercetin. Cell proliferation was assessed using the MTT colorimetric assay after a 48-hour incubation period. Spectrophophotometric assays were used to assess oxidative biomarkers (PC, MDA, and GSH). The ELISA method was used to determine the amount of IL-2 released. A Griess reagent was used to investigate iNOS activity. When compared to young control cells, aged PBMCs had lower proliferation potency, lower IL-2 and NO release, and higher MDA and PC levels. Importantly, quercetin-treated aged PBMCs have a high proliferative response comparable to young cells, restored iNOS activity, and increased levels of GSH antioxidant defences. In comparison to untreated aged PBMCs, treated PBMCs have lower lipo-oxidative damage but higher PC levels. Quercetin may be used as a promising dietary vaccinal adjuvant in the elderly, it has significant effects in reducing immunosenescence hallmarks, as well as mitigating the lipo-oxidative stress in PBMCs cells.","Background Food allergy (FA) affects an increasing proportion of children for reasons that remain obscure. Identification of pathogenic mechanisms involved in FA using untargeted metabolomic approaches may provide much needed diagnostic and prognostic disease biomarkers and improved treatment options.","One of the most important areas of medical science is oncology, which is responsible for both the diagnostics and treatment of cancer diseases. Over the years, there has been an intensive development of cancer diagnostics and treatment. This paper shows the comparison of normal (CCD-18Co) and cancerous (CaCo-2) cell lines of the human gastrointestinal tract on the basis of nanomechanical and biochemical properties in order to obtain information on the cancer biomarkers useful in oncological diagnostics. The research techniques used were: Atomic Force Microscopy and Raman spectroscopy and imaging. In addition, the studies included also the effect of the statins compounds: mevastatin, lovastatin and simvastatin and their influence on nanomechanical and biochemical changes of properties of cells tracking using AFM and Raman imaging techniques. The cytotoxicity of mevastatin and lovastatin was determined by using XTT tests.","Biomolecular information systems offer numerous potential advantages over conventional semiconductor technologies. Downstream from DNA, the metabolome is an information-rich molecular system with diverse chemical dimensions which could be harnessed for information storage and processing. As a proof of principle of postgenomic data storage, here we demonstrate a workflow for representing abstract data in synthetic metabolomes. Our approach leverages robotic liquid handling for writing digital information into chemical mixtures, and mass spectrometry for extracting the data. We present several kilobyte-scale image datasets stored in synthetic metabolomes, which are decoded with accuracy exceeding 98-99% using multi-mass logistic regression. Cumulatively, &gt;100,000 bits of digital image data was written into metabolomes. These early demonstrations provide insight into the benefits and limitations of postgenomic chemical information systems.","Lipid metabolism plays an instructive role in regulating stem cell state and differentiation. However, the roles of lipid mobilization and utilization in stem cell-driven regeneration are unclear. Planarian flatworms readily restore missing tissue due to injury-induced activation of pluripotent somatic stem cells called neoblasts. Here, we identify two intestine-enriched orthologs of apolipoprotein b, apob-1 and apob-2, which mediate transport of neutral lipid stores from the intestine to target tissues including neoblasts, and are required for tissue homeostasis and regeneration. Inhibition of apob function by RNAi causes head regression and lysis in uninjured animals, and delays body axis re-establishment and regeneration of multiple organs in amputated fragments. Furthermore, apob RNAi causes expansion of the population of differentiating neoblast progeny and dysregulates expression of genes enriched in differentiating and mature cells in eight major cell type lineages. We conclude that intestine-derived lipids serve as a source of metabolites required for neoblast differentiation.","Euglena gracilis is a well-studied biotechnologically exploitable phototrophic flagellate harbouring secondary green plastids. Here we describe its plastid proteome obtained by high-resolution proteomics. We identified 1,345 candidate plastid proteins and assigned functional annotations to 774 of them. More than 120 proteins are affiliated neither to the host lineage nor the plastid ancestor and may represent horizontal acquisitions from various algal and prokaryotic groups. Reconstruction of plastid metabolism confirms both the presence of previously studied/predicted enzymes/pathways and also provides direct evidence for unusual features of its metabolism including uncoupling of carotenoid and phytol metabolism, a limited role in amino acid metabolism and the presence of two sets of the SUF pathway for FeS cluster assembly. Most significantly, one of these was acquired by lateral gene transfer (LGT) from the chlamydiae. Plastidial paralogs of membrane trafficking-associated proteins likely mediating a poorly understood fusion of transport vesicles with the outermost plastid membrane were identified, as well as derlin-related proteins that potentially act as protein translocases of the middle membrane, supporting an extremely simplified TIC complex. The proposed innovations may be also linked to specific features of the transit peptide-like regions described here. Hence the Euglena plastid is demonstrated to be a product of several genomes and to combine novel and conserved metabolism and transport processes.","Constructing and comparing gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data has the potential to reveal critical components in the underlying regulatory networks regulating different cellular transcriptional activities. Here, we present a robust and powerful machine learning workflow\u2014scTenifoldNet\u2014for comparative GRN analysis of single cells. The scTenifoldNet workflow, consisting of principal component regression, low-rank tensor approximation, and manifold alignment, constructs and compares transcriptome-wide single-cell GRNs (scGRNs) from different samples to identify gene expression signatures shifting with cellular activity changes such as those associated with pathophysiological processes and responses to environmental perturbations. We used simulated data to benchmark scTenifoldNet\u2019s performance, and then applied scTenifoldNet to several real data sets. In real-data applications, scTenifoldNet identified highly specific changes in gene regulation in response to acute morphine treatment, an antibody anticancer drug, gene knockout, double-stranded RNA stimulus, and amyloid-beta plaques in various types of mouse and human cells. We anticipate that scTenifoldNet can help achieve breakthroughs through constructing and comparing scGRNs in poorly characterized biological systems, by deciphering the full cellular and molecular complexity of the data.","Neurotrophins play a crucial role in the development and regulation of neurons. Alterations in the functioning of these Neurotrophins leads to several Neurodegenerative Disorders. Albeit engineered medications which are accessible for the treatment of Neurodegenerative Disorders, due to their numerous side-effects, it becomes imperative to formulate and synthesize novel drug candidates. Plants could be utilized as an alternative for these manufactured medications because of their low incidental effects in contrast with the engineered drugs. Bacopa monnieri has been traditionally known to be utilized to treat Neurodegenerative Disorders. Therefore, in current study an in-silico based study was carried out to evaluate the pharmacological effect of Bacopa monnieri. Molecular Docking was carried out to screen the active phytochemicals of Bacopa monnieri which can act as potential drug candidates against the causative proteins of Neurodegenerative Disorders. A total of 105 biologically active phytochemicals from Bacopa monnieri were docked against the receptors of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, neurotrophin-3, neurotrophin-4, and nerve growth factor. Based on molecular docking study it was observed that the phytocompounds Vitamin E, Benzene propanoic acid, 3,5-bis(1,1dimethylethyl)4-hydroxy-, methyl ester (BPA), Stigmasterol, and Nonacosane of Bacopa monnieri significantly fits to the active residues of the four selected drug targets. Further Molecular Dynamics simulation study was performed to examine the stability of the binding of these phytochemicals with the selected targets. Drug likeness properties as well as related physico-chemical properties were analyzed through ADMETox study. Our findings suggested that the phytocompounds Vitamin E, BPA, Stigmasterol and Nonacosane significantly bind against brain-derived neurotrophic factor, neurotrophin-3, neurotrophin4, and nerve growth factor, respectively which may be the potential drug candidates for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.","Unphysiological reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation is considered an important pathomechanism for several disease phenotypes with high unmet medical need. Therapeutically, antioxidants have failed multiple times. Instead, focusing on only disease-relevant, enzymatic sources of ROS appears to be a more promising and highly validated approach. Here the family of five NADPH oxidases (NOX) stands out as drug targets. Validation has been restricted, however, mainly to genetically modified rodents and is lacking in other species including human. It is thus unclear whether the different NOX isoforms are sufficiently distinct to allow selective pharmacological modulation. Here we show for five of the most advanced NOX inhibitors that indeed isoform selectivity can be achieved. NOX1 was most potently (IC50) targeted by ML171 (0.1 \u03bcM); NOX2, by VAS2870 (0.7 \u03bcM); NOX4, by M13 (0.01 \u03bcM) and NOX5, by ML090 (0.01 \u03bcM). Conditions need to be carefully controlled though as previously unrecognized non-specific antioxidant and assay artefacts may limit the interpretation of data and this included, surprisingly, one of the most advanced NOX inhibitors, GKT136901. As proof-of-principle that now also pharmacological and non-rodent target validation of different NOX isoforms is possible, we used a human blood-brain barrier model and NOX inhibitor panel at IC50 concentrations. The protective efficacy pattern of this panel confirmed the predominant role of NOX4 in stroke from previous genetic models. Our findings strongly encourage further lead optimization efforts for isoform-selective NOX inhibitors and clinical development and provide an experimental alternative when genetic validation of a NOX isoform is not an option.\n\n","Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) resides asymptomatically in the nasopharynx but can progress from benign colonizer to lethal pulmonary or systemic pathogen. Both viral infection and aging are risk factors for serious pneumococcal infections. Previous work established a murine model that featured the movement of pneumococcus from the nasopharynx to the lung upon nasopharyngeal inoculation with influenza A virus (IAV) but did not fully recapitulate the severe disease associated with human co-infection. We built upon this model by first establishing pneumococcal nasopharyngeal colonization, then inoculating both the nasopharynx and lungs with IAV. In young (2 months) mice, co-infection triggered bacterial dispersal from the nasopharynx into the lungs, pulmonary inflammation, disease and mortality in a fraction of mice. In old mice (20-22 months), co-infection resulted in earlier and more severe disease. Aging was not associated with greater bacterial burdens but rather with more rapid pulmonary inflammation and damage. Both aging and IAV infection led to inefficient bacterial killing by neutrophils ex vivo. Conversely, aging and pneumococcal colonization also blunted IFN-\u03b1 production and increased pulmonary IAV burden. Thus, in this multistep model, IAV promotes pneumococcal pathogenicity by modifying bacterial behavior in the nasopharynx, diminishing neutrophil function, and enhancing bacterial growth in the lung, while pneumococci increase IAV burden likely by compromising a key antiviral response. Thus, this model provides a means to elucidate factors, such as age and co-infection, that promote the evolution of S. pneumoniae from asymptomatic colonizer to invasive pathogen, as well as to investigate consequences of this transition on antiviral defense.","The recently emerged pathogenic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread rapidly, leading to a global COVID-19 pandemic. Binding of the viral spike protein (SARS-2-S) to cell surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) mediates host cell infection. In the present study, we demonstrate that in addition to ACE2, the S1 subunit of SARS-2-S binds to HDL and that SARS-CoV-2 hijacks the SR-B1-mediated HDL uptake pathway to facilitate its entry. SR-B1 facilitates SARS-CoV-2 entry into permissive cells by augmenting virus attachment. MAb (monoclonal antibody)-mediated blocking of SARS-2-S-HDL binding and SR-B1 antagonists strongly inhibit HDL-enhanced SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, SR-B1 is co-expressed with ACE2 in human pulmonary and extrapulmonary tissues. These findings revealed a novel mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 entry and could provide a new target to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Introduction Immunosenescence leads to increased morbidity and mortality associated with viral infections and weaker vaccine responses. This has been well documented for seasonal influenza and the current pandemic with Sars-Cov2, which disproportionately impact older adults, particularly those in residential aged care facilities. Inadequate nutrient intake associated with impaired immunity, respiratory and muscle function are likely to augment the effects of immunosenescence. In this study, we test whether the effects of inadequate nutrition can be reversed by multi-nutrient supplementation, consequently enhancing vaccine responses, reducing the risk of viral infections, and improving respiratory and muscle function.","Vitamin A plays important roles in vision, cellular differentiation, embryonic development, reproduction, growth, and the immune system. Women living in developing countries are at increased risk of undernutrition during pregnancy due to poverty, poor diet quality and quantity, and high fertility rate. Dietary quality and diversity reflect adequacy of vitamin A whereby reduce the risk of vitamin A deficiency. The aim of study was to determine adequacy of vitamin A among pregnant women attending antenatal care in health facilities of Dessie town, Ethiopia, January, 2017. Health facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 390 women that attended antenatal care in Dessie town. The 9 food groups from FAO based on 24hours dietary recall was used for data collection. Adequacy of vitamin A was determined from nutrient adequacy ratio after obtaining report of nutrient intake from food composition table version III and IV in terms of B carotene and retinol equivalent respectively, based on estimated average requirement recommendation of vitamin A, 370 RE/day for pregnant women. Multivariable Logistic regression analysis was done after dichotomizing the dependent variables.","A total of 6,628 PUBMED-registered publications on the relationships between the effects of vaccination and the provision of micronutrients have been studied by methods of topological analysis of text data. In case of insufficient intake of certain micronutrients, the functioning of the acquired immunity is disrupted resulting in an imbalance of populations of T-cells CD4+/CD8+ and of B-lymphocytes. Nutritional supplements of folate, vitamins A, D and B12, which are recognized regulators of cell division, support a wide range of lymphocyte populations. Trace elements zinc, iron, selenium, manganese and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are also important for supporting the mechanisms of acquired immunity. The data presented show that a course intake of these micronutrients by patients planning vaccination can significantly improve its effectiveness. In particular, these micronutrients can increase the titers of antibodies to pathogens, and to reduce the percentage of patients who still contract infection after vaccination. Supplements of these micronutrients can also contribute to the safety of vaccination: to prevent malaise and, in the unfortunate case of contracting infection despite the vaccine, to reduce the severity of the course and the mortality from the corresponding infection.","Objectives Dietary supplements may provide nutrients of relevance to ameliorate SARS-CoV-2 infection, although scientific evidence to support a role is lacking. We investigate whether the regular use of dietary supplements can reduce the risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection in around 1.4M users of the COVID Symptom Study App who completed a supplement use questionnaire.","Background Genomic regions of autozygosity (ROA) arise when an individual is homozygous for haplotypes inherited identical-by-descent from ancestors shared by both parents. Over the past decade, they have gained importance for understanding evolutionary history and the genetic basis of complex diseases and traits. However, methods to detect ROA in dense genotype data have not evolved in step with advances in genome technology that now enable us to rapidly create large high-resolution genotype datasets, limiting our ability to investigate their constituent ROA patterns.","The SEN virus (SENV) has been linked to transfusion-associated non-A-E hepatitis; however, information regarding SENV infections in patients with thalassemia, particularly in those with hepatitis virus co-infections, remains limited. This study investigated the frequency of SENV (genotypes D and H) infections in Iraqi patients with thalassemia who were and were not infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). The study involved 150 \u03b2-thalessemia patients (75 with HCV infections and 75 without) and 75 healthy blood donors. Patient levels of vitamins C and E, liver function markers, and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) were determined. Recovered viral nucleic acids were amplified using the conventional polymerase chain reaction (SENV DNA) or the real-time polymerase chain reaction (HCV RNA) techniques. Only 10% of healthy donors had evidence of SENV infection. Among patients with thalassemia, 80% and 77% of patients with and without concurrent HCV infections, respectively, had SENV infections. DNA sequencing analyses were performed on blood samples obtained from 29 patients. Patients with thalassemia, particularly those with SENV infections, had higher levels of several enzymatic liver function markers and total serum bilirubin (P &lt; 0.05) than did healthy blood donors. Among the examined liver function markers, only gamma-glutamyl transferase demonstrated significantly higher levels in HCV-negative patients infected with SENV-H than in those infected with SENV-D (P = 0.01). There were significantly lower vitamin C, vitamin E, and glutathione peroxidase levels in patients than in healthy donors (P &lt; 0.05), but only glutathione peroxidase levels were significantly lower in HCV-negative thalassemia patients infected with SENV than in those without SENV infections (P = 0.04). The SENV-H genotype sequences were similar to the global standard genes in GenBank. These results increase our understanding of the nature of the SENV-H genotype and the differential role of SENV-H infections, compared to SENV-D infections, in patients with thalassemia, in Iraq.","Targeting proximity labeling enzymes to specific cellular locations is a viable strategy for profiling subcellular proteomes. Here, we generated transgenic mice expressing a mitochondrial matrix-targeted ascorbate peroxidase (MAX-Tg) to analyze tissue-specific matrix proteomes. Desthiobiotin-phenol labeling of muscle tissues from MAX-Tg mice allowed for efficient profiling of mitochondrial-localized proteins in these tissues. Comparative analysis of matrix proteomes from MAX-Tg muscle tissues revealed differential enrichment of mitochondrial proteins related to energy production in between different muscle groups. Reticulon 4 interacting protein 1 (RTN4IP1), also known as Optic Atrophy-10 (OPA10), was highly enriched in the cardiac and soleus muscles and was found to localize to the mitochondrial matrix via a strong mitochondrial targeting sequence at its N-terminus. Protein structure analysis revealed that RTN4IP1 is an NADPH oxidoreductase with structural homology to bacterial quinone oxidoreductase. Enzymatic activity assays, interactome analysis, and metabolite profiling confirmed a function for RTN4IP1 in coenzyme Q (CoQ) biosynthesis. Rtn4ip1-knockout C2C12 cells had reduced CoQ9 levels, were vulnerable to oxidative stress, and had decreased oxygen consumption rates and ATP production. Collectively, RTN4IP1 is a mitochondrial antioxidant NADPH oxidoreductase supporting oxidative phosphorylation activity in muscle tissue.","Human noroviruses (HuNoVs) are acute viral gastroenteritis pathogens that affect all age groups, yet no approved vaccines and drugs to treat HuNoV infection are available. In this study, with a human intestinal enteroid (HIE) culture system where HuNoVs are able to replicate reproducibly, we screened an antiviral compound library to identify compound(s) showing anti-HuNoV activity. Dasabuvir, which has been developed as an anti-hepatitis C virus agent, was found to inhibit HuNoV infection in HIEs at micromolar concentrations. Dasabuvir also inhibited severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and human A rotavirus (RVA) infection in HIEs. To our knowledge, this is the first study to screen an antiviral compound library for HuNoV using HIEs and we successfully identified dasabuvir as a novel anti-HuNoV inhibitor that warrants further investigation.","The recent emergence of a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has led to the global pandemic of the severe disease COVID-19 in humans. While efforts to quickly identify effective antiviral therapies have focused largely on repurposing existing drugs1\u20134, the current standard of care, remdesivir, remains the only authorized antiviral intervention of COVID-19 and provides only modest clinical benefits5. Here we show that water-soluble derivatives of \u03b1-tocopherol have potent antiviral activity and synergize with remdesivir as inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Through an artificial-intelligence-driven in silico screen and in vitro viral inhibition assay, we identified D-\u03b1-tocopherol polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS) as an effective antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 and \u03b2-coronaviruses more broadly that also displays strong synergy with remdesivir. We subsequently determined that TPGS and other water-soluble derivatives of \u03b1-tocopherol inhibit the transcriptional activity of purified SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and identified affinity binding sites for these compounds within a conserved, hydrophobic interface between SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 7 and nonstructural protein 8 that is functionally implicated in the assembly of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp6. In summary, we conclude that solubilizing modifications to \u03b1-tocopherol allow it to interact with the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, making it an effective antiviral molecule alone and even more so in combination with remdesivir. These findings are significant given that many tocopherol derivatives, including TPGS, are considered safe for humans, orally bioavailable, and dramatically enhance the activity of the only approved antiviral for SARS-CoV-2 infection7\u20139.","The classical drug development pipeline necessitates studies using animal models of human disease to gauge future efficacy in humans, however, there is a comparatively low conversion rate from success in animals to in humans. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a complex chronic disease without any licensed therapies and hence a major field of animal research. We performed a meta-analysis of 414 interventional rodent studies (6,575 animals) in NAFLD to assess the mean difference in hepatic triglyceride content. 20 of 21 studied drug classes had similar efficacy with a mean difference of \u221230% hepatic triglyceride. However, when publication bias was accounted for, this reduced to \u221216% difference. Study characteristics were only able to account for a minority of variability on meta-regression, and we replicated previous findings of high risk of bias across 82% of cohorts. These findings build on previous work in preclinical neuroscience and help to explain the challenge of reproducibility and translation within the field of metabolism.","Increasing the diagnostic capacity of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 infection) is required to improve case detection, reduce COVID-19 expansion, and boost the world economy. Rapid antigen detection tests are cheaper and easier to implement, but their diagnostic performance has been questioned compared to RT-PCR. Here, we evaluate the performance of the Standard Q COVID-19 antigen test for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection and predicting contagiousness compared to RT-PCR and viral culture, respectively. The antigen test was 100.0% specific but only 40.9% sensitive for diagnosing infection compared to RT-PCR. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 contagiousness is highly unlikely with a negative antigen test since it exhibited a negative predictive value of 99.9% than viral culture. Furthermore, a cycle threshold (Ct) value of 18.1 in RT-PCR was shown to be the one that best predicts contagiousness (AUC 97.6%). Thus, screening people with antigen testing is a good approach to prevent SARS-CoV-2 contagion and allow returning to daily activities.","","We previously demonstrated that maize (Zea mays) locus very oil yellow1 (vey1) encodes a putative cis-regulatory expression polymorphism at the magnesium chelatase subunit I gene (aka oil yellow1) that strongly modifies the chlorophyll content of the semi-dominant Oy1-N1989 mutants. The vey1 allele of Mo17 inbred line reduces chlorophyll content in the mutants leading to reduced photosynthetic output. Oy1-N1989 mutants in B73 reached reproductive maturity four days later than wild-type siblings. Enhancement of Oy1-N1989 by the Mo17 allele at the vey1 QTL delayed maturity further, resulting in detection of a flowering time QTL in two bi-parental mapping populations crossed to Oy1-N1989. The near isogenic lines of B73 harboring the vey1 allele from Mo17 delayed flowering of Oy1-N1989 mutants by twelve days. Just as previously observed for chlorophyll content, vey1 had no effect on reproductive maturity in the absence of the Oy1-N1989 allele. Loss of chlorophyll biosynthesis in Oy1-N1989 mutants and enhancement by vey1 reduced CO2 assimilation. We attempted to separate the effects of photosynthesis on the induction of flowering from a possible impact of chlorophyll metabolites and retrograde signaling by manually reducing leaf area. Removal of leaves, independent of the Oy1-N1989 mutant, delayed flowering but surprisingly reduced chlorophyll contents of emerging leaves. Thus, defoliation did not completely separate the identity of the signal(s) that regulates flowering time from changes in chlorophyll content in the foliage. These findings illustrate the necessity to explore the linkage between metabolism and the mechanisms that connect it to flowering time regulation.","Plastoglobules (PGs) are dynamic protein-lipid micro-compartments in plastids enriched for isoprenoid-derived metabolites. Chloroplast PGs support formation, remodeling and controlled dismantling of thylakoids during developmental transitions and environmental responses. However, the specific molecular functions of most PG proteins are still poorly understood. This study harnesses recent co-mRNA expression from ATTED-II using combined microarray and RNAseq information on an updated inventory of 34 PG proteins, as well as proteomics data across 30 Arabidopsis tissue types from ATHENA. Hierarchical clustering based on relative abundance for the PG proteins across non-photosynthetic and photosynthetic tissue types showed their coordinated protein accumulation across Arabidopsis parts, tissue types, development and senescence. We generated multiple mRNA-based networks by applying different coefficient thresholds; functional enrichment was determined for each network and PG gene. Combined analysis of these stringency networks identified a central hub and four peripheral modules. Enrichment of specific nuclear transcription factors (e.g. Golden2-like) and support for cross-talk between PGs and the plastid gene expression was observed, and specific ABC1 kinases seem part of a light signaling network. Examples of other specific findings are that FBN7b is involved with upstream steps of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis and that ABC1K9 is involved in starch metabolism.","Survival rates vary dramatically among species and predictably across latitudes, but causes of this variation are unclear. The rate of living hypothesis posits that physiological damage from metabolism causes species with faster metabolic rates to exhibit lower survival rates. However, whether increased survival commonly observed in tropical and south temperate latitudes is associated with slower metabolic rate remains unclear. We compared metabolic rates and annual survival rates across 46 species that we measured, and 147 species from literature data across northern, southern, and tropical latitudes. High metabolic rates were associated with lower survival but latitude had substantial direct effects on survival independent of metabolism. The inability of metabolic rate to explain latitudinal variation in survival suggests 1) that species may evolve physiological mechanisms that mitigate physiological damage from cellular metabolism, and 2) a larger role of extrinsic environmental, rather than intrinsic metabolic, causes of latitudinal differences in mortality.","","The ability of plants to cope with cold temperatures relies on their photosynthetic activity. This already demonstrates that the chloroplast is of utmost importance for cold acclimation and acquisition of freezing tolerance. During cold acclimation, the properties of the chloroplast change markedly. To provide the most comprehensive view of the protein repertoire of chloroplast envelope, we analysed this membrane system in Arabidopsis thaliana using MS-based proteomics. Profiling chloroplast envelope membranes was achieved by a cross comparison of protein intensities across plastid and the enriched membrane fraction both under normal and cold conditions. Multivariable logistic regression models the probabilities for the classification problem to address envelop localization. In total, we identified 38 envelope membrane intrinsic or associated proteins exhibiting altered abundance after cold acclimation. These proteins comprise several solute carries, such as the ATP/ADP antiporter NTT2 (substantially increased abundance) or the maltose exporter MEX1 (substantially decreased abundance). Remarkably, analysis of the frost recovery of ntt loss-of-function and mex1 overexpressor mutants confirmed that the comparative proteome is well suited to identify novel key factors involved in cold acclimation and acquisition of freezing tolerance. Moreover, for proteins with known physiological function we propose scenarios explaining their possible role in cold acclimation. Furthermore, spatial proteomics introduces a novel layer of complexity and enabled the identification of proteins differentially localized at the envelope membrane under the changing environmental regime.","As sessile organisms, plants are subjected to fluctuating sunlight including potentially detrimental ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B). In Arabidopsis thaliana, experiments under controlled conditions have shown that UV RESISTANCE LOCUS 8 (UVR8) controls photomorphogenic responses for acclimation and tolerance to UV-B; however, its long-term impacts on plant performance remain poorly understood in naturally fluctuating environments. Here we quantified the survival and reproduction of different Arabidopsis mutant genotypes in diverse field and laboratory conditions. We found that uvr8 mutants produced more fruits than wild type in growth chambers with artificial low UV-B conditions but not in natural field conditions. Importantly, independent double mutants of UVR8 and the blue-light photoreceptor gene CRYPTOCHROME 1 (CRY1) in two genetic backgrounds showed a drastic reduction in fitness in the field. UV-B attenuation experiments in field conditions and supplemental UV-B in growth chambers demonstrated that UV-B caused the conditional cry1 uvr8 lethality phenotype. RNA sequencing in different conditions revealed a large number of genes with statistical interaction of UVR8 and CRY1 mutations in the presence of UV-B in the field. Among them, Gene Ontology analysis identified enrichment of categories related to UV-B response, oxidative stress, photoprotection and DNA damage repair. Our study demonstrates the functional importance of the UVR8-mediated response across life stages in natura, which is partially redundant with CRY1, and provides an integral picture of gene expression associated with plant environmental responses under diverse environmental conditions.","Cancer cells develop tactics to circumvent the interventions by desensitizing themselves to interventions. The principle route of desensitization includes activation of survival pathways (e.g. NF-kB, PARP) and downregulation of cell death pathways (e.g. CD95, ASK1). As a result, it requires high dose of therapy to induce cell death which, in turn damages normal cells through the collateral effects. Methods are needed to sensitize the low and non-responsive resistant tumor cells in order to evoke a better response from the current treatments. Current treatments including chemotherapy can induce cell death only in bulk cancer cells sparing low-responsive and resistant tumor cells. Here we report a novel tumor sensitizer derived from the natural Vitamin E analogue (AMP-001). The drug design is based on a novel \u201cA priori activation of apoptosis pathways of tumor technology (AAAPT) which is designed to activate cell death pathways and inhibit survival pathways simultaneously. It involves an inbuilt targeting vector which targets tumor specific Cathepsin B, overexpressed by many cancers including gastric cancer. Our results indicate that AMP-001 sensitizes gastric cancer cells which resulted in expanding the therapeutic index of front-line chemotherapy doxorubicin both in vitro and in vivo nude mouse model. The synergy between AMP-001 and doxorubicin could pave a new pathway to use AMP-001 as a neoadjuvant to chemotherapy to achieve a better efficacy and reduced off-target toxicity.","The possible protective effects of methanolic extract Acrocarpus fraxinifolius leaves (MEAFL) were assessed against the APAP\u2013induced organ toxicity in male rats. Also, the content of polyphenols extracted from AFL was studied, and their relationship with antioxidant activity was investigated. MEAFL was tested for cytotoxicity on Vero cell line, with reference to IC50, and other non-toxic concentrations of all the extracts. The antiviral activity against HSV1 for all non-toxic concentrations of the extract was determined using plaque reduction assay. It was found that MEAFL showed a reduction of serum hepatic and renal cellular toxicity and cellular lipid peroxidation, as well as enhanced cellular antioxidant. Also, our results revealed that the inhibitory activity of the virus was dose dependent on the polyphenol content of the examined extract. The MIC for the MEAFL extract was determined as well as the EC50 and SI. Calculated SI showed promising value for the MEAFL, and hence can be used as therapeutic medication for HSV1. To study other possible mode of action, Vero cells were treated with the examined extracts before, during, and after virus infection to give an insight on the interference of the extract in each step in the virus life cycle. In conclusion, MEAFL showed a remarkable antioxidant effect against APAP induced organs toxicity. Also, examined extracts exhibited the antiviral activity against HSV1.","Recent focus is on analysis of biological activities of extracts from plant species. Zygophyllaceae is exceedingly important angiosperm family with many taxa being used in folk medicines widely dispersed in arid and semi-arid zones of Balochistan, Pakistan. Only a small proportion of them have been scientifically analyzed and many species are nearly facing extinction. Therefore present investigation explores the biochemical and bioactive potential of fourteen folk medicinal plants usually used for treatments of different ailments. Fresh aerial parts of nine taxa and two fruit samples were collected from plants growing in arid and semi-arid zones of Balochistan and analyzed for enzymatic, non-enzymatic and other biochemical activities. Higher phytochemical activities were detected in the aerial parts. Superoxide dismutase was detected maximum in Fagonia indica, (184.7\u00b15.17 units/g), ascorbate peroxidase in Tribulus longipetalus subsp. longipetalus (947.5\u00b112.5 Units/g), catalase and peroxidase was higher in Peganum harmala (555.0\u00b15.0 and 2597.8\u00b10.4 units/g respectively). Maximum esterase and alpha amylase activity was found in Zygophyllum fabago (14.3\u00b10.44 and 140\u00b118.8 mg/g respectively). Flavonoid content was high in T. longipetalus subsp. longipetalus (666.1\u00b149 \u03bcg/ml). The highest total phenolic content and tannin was revealed in F. olivieri (72125\u00b1425 and 37050\u00b11900 \u03bcM/g. respectively). Highest value of ascorbic acid was depicted in F. bruguieri var. rechingeri (448\u00b11.5 \u03bcg/g). Total soluble Proteins and reducing sugars were detected higher in P. harmala (372.3\u00b154 and 5.9\u00b10.1 mg/g respectively). Maximum total antioxidant capacity (TAC) was depicted in Z. simplex (16.9\u00b10.01 \u03bcM/g). Pigment analysis exhibited the high value of lycopene and total carotenoids in T. terrestris (7.44\u00b10.2 and 35.5\u00b10.0 mg/g respectively). Chlorophyll a, b and total chlorophyll content was found maximum in T. longipetalus subsp. pterophorus (549.1\u00b19.9, 154.3\u00b110 and 703.4\u00b120.2 ug/g respectively). All taxa exhibited anti-inflammatory activity as well as anti-diabetic inhibitory potential. Seed extracts of Zygophyllum eurypterum (96%) exhibited highest inhibitory potential, along with twelve other taxa of Zygophyllaceae indicated (96-76%) activity when compared with the standard drug diclofenac sodium (79%). Seeds of T. longipetalus subsp. longipetalus (85%) exhibited the highest anti-diabetic activity; other eleven taxa also exhibited inhibitory activity of \u03b1-amylase ranging from (85-69%) compared with Metformin (67%) standard drug. Phytochemical screening revealed that selected taxa proved to be the potential source of natural antioxidants and could further be explored for in-vivo studies and utilized in pharmaceutical industries as potent therapeutic agents validating their ethno-pharmacological uses.","Apolipoprotein B (ApoB) is the primary protein of chylomicrons, VLDLs and LDLs and is essential for their assembly. Defects in ApoB synthesis and secretion result in several human diseases, including abetalipoproteinemia and familial hypobetalipoproteinemia. Conversely, high levels of APOB in plasma are associated with increased risk for coronary heart disease and atherosclerosis.","The diverse cultivars of Brassica oleracea and Brassica napus constitute an important global food source. Of those, the Brassica oleracea convar. acephala cultivar group containing var. sabellica and var. palmifolia and Brassica napus var. pabularia, collectively known as kale, are nutritious leafy greens consumed for their abundance of vitamins and micronutrients. Typified by their curly, serrated or wavy leaves, kale varieties have been primarily defined based on their leaf morphology and geographic origin, despite having complex genetic backgrounds. Kale is a very promising crop for vertical farming due to its high nutritional content. However, systematic analysis of kale growth and molecular composition under different light regimes suitable for vertical farming has been lacking. Hence, we selected nine diverse, publicly available and commercially grown kale cultivars for growth under light emitting diode (LED)-replicated sunlight-like conditions. We then analyzed their growth and nutrition using a combination of phenomics, proteomics and metabolomics. As plant growth and development are driven by the diel molecular activities of plants, we harvested kale leaf tissue at both end-of-day (ED) and end-of-night (EN) time-points for all molecular analyses. Our results reveal that diel metabolome and proteome signatures sub-divide the selected kale cultivars into two distinct groups, defined by their amino acid and sugar content, along with significant proteome differences involving carbon and nitrogen metabolism, mRNA splicing, protein translation and light harvesting. Together, our analysis has generated robust quantitative insights into the diel growth and development landscape of kale, significantly advancing our fundamental understanding of this nutritious leafy green for next-generation breeding and biotechnology.","7-ketocholesterol (KChol) is one of the most cytotoxic oxysterols found in the plasma membrane, and increased levels of KChol are associated with numerous pathologies. It is thought to induce apoptosis via inactivation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway \u2014 a pathway that depends on lipid-rafts as signaling platforms. By means of coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that KChol disrupts the liquid-liquid phase separation seen in an equimolar mixture of (dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine) DPPC, (dioleoylphosphatidylcholine) DOPC, and Cholesterol (Chol). This disruption occurs via two mechanisms: i) KChol adopts a wider range of orientations with the membrane, which disrupts the packing of neigh-boring lipids and ii) KChol has no preference for DPPC over DOPC, which is the main driving force for lateral demixing in DPPC/DOPC/Chol membranes. This provides a molecular description of the means by which KChol induces apoptosis, and illustrates that a single chemical substitution to cholesterol can have a profound impact on the lateral organization of lipid membranes.","The contribution of epigenetic variation to phenotypic variation is unclear. Imprinted genes, because of their strong association with epigenetic modifications, represent an opportunity for the discovery of such phenomena. In mammals and flowering plants, a subset of genes are expressed from only one parental allele in a process called gene imprinting. Imprinting is associated with differential DNA methylation and chromatin modifications between parental alleles. In flowering plants imprinting occurs in a seed tissue \u2013 endosperm. Proper endosperm development is essential for the production of viable seeds. We previously showed that in Arabidopsis thaliana intraspecific imprinting variation is correlated with naturally occurring DNA methylation polymorphisms. Here, we investigated the mechanisms and function of allele-specific imprinting of the class IV homeodomain-Leucine zipper (HD-ZIP) transcription factor HDG3. In imprinted strains, HDG3 is expressed primarily from the methylated paternally inherited allele. We manipulated the methylation state of endogenous HDG3 in a non-imprinted strain and demonstrated that methylation of a proximal transposable element is sufficient to promote HDG3 expression and imprinting. Gain of HDG3 imprinting was associated with earlier endosperm cellularization and changes in seed weight. These results indicate that epigenetic variation alone is sufficient to explain imprinting variation and demonstrate that epialleles can underlie variation in seed development phenotypes.","Gut bacterial symbionts can support animal nutrition by facilitating digestion and providing valuable metabolites. While the composition of gut symbiont communities shifts with host development in holometabolous insects, changes in symbiotic roles between immature and adult stages are not well documented, especially in ants. Here, we explored the metabolic capabilities of microbiomes sampled from herbivorous turtle ant (Cephalotes sp.) larvae and adult workers through genomic and metagenomic screenings and targeted in vitro metabolic assays. We reveal that larval guts harbor bacterial symbionts from the Enterobacteriales, Lactobacillales and Rhizobiales orders, with impressive metabolic capabilities, including catabolism of plant and fungal recalcitrant fibers common in turtle ant diets, and energy-generating fermentation. Additionally, several members of the specialized turtle ant adult gut microbiome, sampled downstream of an anatomical barrier that dams large food particles, show a conserved potential to depolymerize many dietary fibers and other carbohydrates. Symbionts from both life stages have the genomic capacity to recycle nitrogen, synthesize amino acids and B-vitamins, and perform several key aspects of sulfur metabolism. We also document, for the first time in ants, an adult-associated Campylobacterales symbiont with an apparent capacity to anaerobically oxidize sulfide, reduce nitrate, and fix carbon dioxide. With help of their gut symbionts, including several bacteria likely acquired from the environment, turtle ant larvae appear as an important component of turtle ant colony digestion and nutrition. In addition, the conserved nature of the digestive, energy-generating, and nutritive capacities among adult-enriched symbionts suggests that nutritional ecology of turtle ant colonies has long been shaped by specialized, behaviorally-transferred gut bacteria with over 46 million years of residency.","Liver X receptors (LXR) \u03b1 and \u03b2 serve important roles in cholesterol homeostasis, anti-inflammatory processes and the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). However, the development of therapies for liver fibrosis based on LXR agonists have been hampered due to side-effects such as liver steatosis. In this study, we demonstrated that HSCs expressed high levels of LXR\u03b2, but not LXR\u03b1, and that overexpression of LXR\u03b2 suppressed fibrosis and HSC activation in a carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced fibrosis mouse model, without resulting in liver steatosis. Furthermore, Hedgehog (Hh)-regulated proteins, markedly increased in the CCl4-affected liver and mainly expressed in activated HSCs, were repressed under conditions of LXR\u03b2 overexpression. In addition, LXR\u03b2 knockout led to activation of Hh signaling and triggering of HSC activation, while overexpression of LXR\u03b2 led to the inhibition of the Hh pathway and suppression of HSC activation. These results suggest that LXR\u03b2 suppresses the activation mechanism of HSCs by inhibiting Hh signaling. In conclusion, LXR\u03b2, by restoring the differentiation of HSCs, may be a promising therapeutic target for liver fibrosis without the adverse side-effects of LXR\u03b1 activation.","Pluripotent stem cells (PSC) endocrine differentiation at a large scale allows sampling of transcriptome and proteome with phosphoproteome (proteoform) at specific time points. We describe the dynamic time course of changes in cells undergoing directed beta-cell differentiation and show target proteins or previously unknown phosphorylation of critical proteins in pancreas development, NKX6-1, and Chromogranin A (CHGA). We describe fluctuations in the correlation between gene expression, protein abundance, and phosphorylation, which follow differentiation protocol perturbations of cell fates at all stages to identify proteoform profiles. Our computational modeling recognizes outliers on a phenomic landscape of endocrine differentiation, and we outline several new biological pathways involved. We have validated our proteomic data by analyzing two independent single-cell RNA sequencing datasets for in-vitro pancreatic islet productions using the same cell starting material and differentiation protocol and corroborating our findings for several proteins suggest as targets for future research.","Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is a heritable trait with two potential sources of heritability (h2): inherited variation in non-telomeric regions (e.g., SNPs that influence telomere maintenance) and variability in the lengths of telomeres in gametes that produce offspring zygotes (i.e., \u201cdirect\u201d inheritance). Prior studies of LTL h2 have not attempted to disentangle these two sources. Here, we use a novel approach for detecting the direct inheritance of telomeres by studying the association between identity-by-descent (IBD) sharing at chromosome ends and phenotypic similarity in LTL. We measured genome-wide SNPs and LTL for a sample of 5,069 Bangladeshi adults with substantial relatedness. For each of the 7,254 relative pairs identified, we used SNPs near the telomeres to estimate the number of chromosome ends shared IBD, a proxy for the number of telomeres shared IBD (Tshared). We then estimated the association between Tshared and the squared pairwise difference in LTL ((\u0394LTL)2) within various classes of relatives (siblings, avuncular, cousins, and distant), adjusting for overall genetic relatedness (\u03d5). The association between Tshared and (\u0394LTL)2 was inverse among all relative pair types. In a meta-analysis including all relative pairs (\u03d5 &gt;0.05), the association between Tshared and (\u0394LTL)2 (P=0.002) was stronger than the association between \u03d5 and (\u0394LTL)2 (P=0.45). Our results provide strong evidence that telomere length (TL) in parental germ cells impacts TL in offspring cells and contributes to LTL h2 despite telomere \u201creprogramming\u201d during embryonic development. Applying our method to larger studies will enable robust estimation of LTL h2 attributable to direction transmission.","Exposure to environmental neurotoxicants is a significant concern due to their potential to cause permanent or irreversible damage to the human nervous system. Here, we present the first dedicated knowledgebase, NeurotoxKb, on environmental neurotoxicants specific to mammals. Using a detailed workflow, we have compiled 475 potential non-biogenic neurotoxicants from 835 published studies with evidence of neurotoxicity specific to mammals. A unique feature of NeurotoxKb is the manual curation effort to compile and standardize the observed neurotoxic effects for the potential neurotoxicants from 835 published studies. For the 475 potential neurotoxicants, we have compiled diverse information such as chemical structures, environmental sources, chemical classification, physicochemical properties, molecular descriptors, predicted ADMET properties, and target human genes. To better understand the prospect of human exposure, we have explored the presence of potential neurotoxicants in external exposomes via two different analyses. By analyzing 55 chemical lists representing global regulations and guidelines, we reveal potential neurotoxicants both in regular use and produced in high volume. By analyzing human biospecimens, we reveal potential neurotoxicants detected in them. Lastly, a construction of the chemical similarity network and ensuing analysis revealed the diversity of the toxicological space of 475 potential neurotoxicants. NeurotoxKb is accessible online at: https://cb.imsc.res.in/neurotoxkb/.","Subclinical ketosis (SCK) and periparturient diseases considerably account for economic and welfare losses in dairy cows. The majority of scientific reports investigating the prevalence of SCK and production diseases are based on empirical studies conducted in Western Europe and North America. The present study surveyed the prevalence of SCK and production-related clinical diseases in early lactating cows in various countries across the world other than those in North America and Western Europe. Twelve countries of South and Central America (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico), Africa (South Africa), Asia (Thailand, China), Eastern Europe (Russia, Ukraine), Australia and New Zealand were assessed, and data from a total of 8,902 cows kept at 541 commercial dairy farms were obtained. A minimum of 5 cows per farm were blood sampled and examined once after parturition up to day 21 of lactation. Blood concentration of \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) was measured (threshold for SCK: 1.2 mmol/l) and the presence of production-related diseases such as milk fever, retained placenta, mastitis, metritis, displaced abomasum, claw disease and clinical ketosis was recorded. More than 95% of all cows were examined in their second week of lactation. Across all investigated countries, the SCK prevalence was 24.1%, ranging from 8.3% up to 40.1%. The prevalence of production-related diseases detected during the first 21 days of lactation was relatively low (&lt; 5%). Calculated odds ratios did not indicate an elevated risk for production diseases in cows with SCK. Despite differences in production systems across countries and variation between individual farms within a region, the present study data on SCK prevalence align with observations in Western European and North American dairy herds. At the very early stage of sampling and clinical examination for detection of SCK, it cannot be excluded that certain production diseases such as DA, lameness and mastitis have developed later.","The interaction of Tween-20 with lipid membranes is crucial for a number of biotechnological applications including viral inactivation and membrane protein extraction, but the underlying mechanistic details have remained elusive. Evidence from ensemble assays supports a global model of Tween-20 induced membrane disruption that broadly encompasses association of the surfactant with the membrane surface, membrane fragmentation and the release of mixed micelles to solution, but whether this process involves intermediate and dynamic transitions between regimes is an open question. In search of the mechanistic origins of membrane disruption, increasing focus is put on identifying Tween-20 interactions with highly controllable model membranes. In light of this, and to unveil quantitative mechanistic details, we employed highly interdisciplinary biophysical approaches, including quartz-crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring, steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence and FRET spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, wide-field single-vesicle imaging and scanning electron microscopy, to interrogate the interactions between Tween-20 and both freely-diffusing and surface-immobilized model-membrane vesicles. Using ultrasensitive sensing approaches, we discovered that Tween-20 leads to a stepwise and phase-dependent structural remodelling of sub-micron sized vesicles that includes permeabilization and swelling, even at detergent concentrations below the critical micellar concentration. These insights into the structural perturbation of lipid vesicles upon Tween-20 interaction highlight the impact on vesicle conformation prior to complete solubilization, and the tools presented may have general relevance for probing the interaction between lipid vesicles and a wide variety of disruptive agents.","Advances in technology have allowed for the study of metabolomics in the context of disease, enabling the discovery of new potential risk factors, diagnostic markers, and drug targets. For neurological and psychiatric phenotypes, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is of particular biomedical importance as it is in direct contact with the brain and spinal cord. However, the CSF metabolome is difficult to study on a large scale due to the relative complexity of the procedure needed to collect the fluid compared to blood or urine studies. Here, we present a metabolome-wide association study (MWAS), an analysis using individual-level genetic and metabolomic data from two cohorts to impute metabolites into large samples with genome-wide association summary statistics. We conducted a metabolome-wide genome-wide association analysis with 338 CSF metabolites, identifying 16 genotype-metabolite associations, 6 of which were novel. Using these results, we then built prediction models for all available CSF metabolites and tested for associations with 27 neurological and psychiatric phenotypes in large cohorts, identifying 19 significant CSF metabolite-phenotype associations. Our results demonstrate the potential of MWAS to overcome the logistic challenges inherent in cerebrospinal fluid research to study the role of metabolomics in brain-related phenotypes and the feasibility of this framework for similar studies of omic data in scarce sample types.","","Carotenoids are core plastid components, yet a regulatory function during plastid biogenesis remains enigmatic. A unique carotenoid biosynthesis mutant, carotenoid chloroplast regulation 2 (ccr2), that has no prolamellar body (PLB) and normal PROTOCHLOROPHYLLIDE OXIDOREDUCTASE (POR) levels, was used to demonstrate a regulatory function for carotenoids under varied dark-light regimes. A forward genetics approach revealed how an epistatic interaction between a (-carotene isomerase mutant (ziso-155) and ccr2 blocked the biosynthesis of specific cis-carotenes and restored PLB formation in etioplasts. We attributed this to a novel apocarotenoid signal, as chemical inhibition of carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase activity restored PLB formation in ccr2 etioplasts during skotomorphogenesis. The apocarotenoid acted in parallel to the transcriptional repressor of photomorphogenesis, DEETIOLATED1 (DET1), to post-transcriptionally regulate PROTOCHLOROPHYLLIDE OXIDOREDUCTASE (POR), PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR3 (PIF3) and ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) protein levels. The apocarotenoid signal and det1 complemented each other to restore POR levels and PLB formation, thereby controlling plastid development.","Symptoms and complications associated with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and organ damage have been linked to SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1-induced increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by immune cells. In this study, the effects of an extract of Garcinia kola seeds and garcinoic acid were investigated in SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1-stimulated human PBMCs. Results of ELISA experiments revealed that Garcinia kola extract (6.25, 12.5 and 25 \u03bcg/mL) and garcinoic acid (1.25, 2.5 and 5 \u03bcM) significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1-induced increased secretion of TNF\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-8 in PBMCs. In-cell western assays showed that pre-treatment with Garcinia kola extract and garcinoic acid reduced elevated expressions of both phospho-p65 and phospho-\u03baB\u03b1 proteins, as well as NF-\u03baB DNA binding capacity and NF-\u03baB-driven luciferase expression following stimulation of PBMCs with spike glycoprotein S1. Furthermore, pre-treatment of PBMCs with Garcinia kola extract prior to stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1 resulted in reduced damage to adjacent A549 lung epithelial cells. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GCMS) and HPLC-PDA confirmed the presence of garcinoic acid in the Garcinia kola extract used in this study. These results suggest that the seed of Garcinia kola and garcinoic acid are natural products which may possess pharmacological/therapeutic benefits in reducing cytokine storm during the late stage of severe SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus infections.","Water being a vital part of cell protoplasm plays a significant role in sustaining life on earth; drastic changes in climatic condition leads to limit the availability of water and causing other environmental chaos. Alpha-tocopherol being a powerful antioxidant plays a vital role in scavenging the ill effects of oxidative stress. A pot experiment was conducted by exposing lentil cultivar (Punjab-2009) to varying levels of induced drought stress, sprinkled with \u03b1-tocopherol 100, 200 and 300 mg/L. Induced water deficit stress conditions caused a pronounced decline in growth parameters including absolute growth rate (AGR), leaf area index (LAI), leaf area ratio (LAR), root shoot ratio (RSR), relative growth rate (RGR), chlorophyll a, b, total chlorophyll content, carotenoids and soluble protein content (SPC) which were significantly enhanced by exogenously applied \u03b1-tocopherol. Moreover, a significant increase was reported in total proline content (TPC), soluble sugar content (SSC), glycine betaine (GB) content, endogenous tocopherol levels, ascorbate peroxidase (APX), catalase (CAT) peroxidase (POD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities. On contrary, exogenously applied \u03b1-tocopherol significantly reduced the concentrations of malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In conclusion, it was confirmed that exogenously applied \u03b1-tocopherol under induced drought stress regimes ameliorated drought stress tolerance potential of lentil cultivar to a great extent; by enhancing growth, physiological and biochemical attributes.","","Tributyltin (TBT), a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3)/retinoid X receptor (RXR) ligand and founding member of the environmental obesogen chemical class, induces adipocyte differentiation and suppresses bone formation. A growing number of environmental PPAR\u03b3 ligands are being identified. However, the potential for environmental PPAR\u03b3 ligands to induce adverse metabolic effects has been questioned because PPAR\u03b3 is a therapeutic target in treatment of type II diabetes. We evaluated the molecular consequences of TBT exposure during bone marrow multipotent mesenchymal stromal cell (BM-MSC) differentiation in comparison to rosiglitazone, a therapeutic PPAR\u03b3 ligand, and LG100268, a synthetic RXR ligand. Mouse primary BM-MSCs (female, C57BL/6J) undergoing bone differentiation were exposed to maximally efficacious and human relevant concentrations of rosiglitazone (100 nM), LG100268 (100 nM) or TBT (80 nM) for 4 days. Gene expression was assessed using microarrays, and in silico functional annotation was performed using pathway enrichment analysis approaches. Pathways related to osteogenesis were downregulated by all three ligands, while pathways related to adipogenesis were upregulated by rosiglitazone and TBT. However, pathways related to mitochondrial biogenesis and brown-in-white (brite) adipocyte differentiation were more significantly upregulated in rosiglitazone-treated than TBT-treated cells. The lack of induction of genes involved in adipocyte energy dissipation by TBT was confirmed by an independent gene expression analysis in BM-MSCs undergoing adipocyte differentiation and by analysis of a publically available 3T3 L1 data set. Furthermore, rosiglitazone, but not TBT, induced mitochondrial biogenesis. This study is the first to show that an environmental PPAR\u03b3 ligand has a limited capacity to induce health promoting activities of PPAR\u03b3.","siRNAs hold a great potential for cancer therapy, however, poor stability in body fluids and low cellular uptake limit their use in the clinic. To enhance the bioavailability of siRNAs in tumors, novel, safe, and effective carriers are needed. Here, we developed cationic solid lipid nanoparticles (cSLNs) to carry siRNAs targeting EphA2 receptor tyrosine kinase (siEphA2), which is overexpressed in many solid tumors including prostate cancer (PCa). Using DDAB cationic lipid instead of DOTMA reduced nanoparticle size and enhanced both cellular uptake and gene silencing in PCa cells. After verifying the efficacy of siEphA2-loaded nanoparticles, we further evaluated a potential combination with a histone lysine demethylase inhibitor, JIB-04. Silencing EphA2 by siEphA2-loaded DDAB-cSLN did not affect the viability (2D and 3D), migration, and clonogenicity of PC-3 cells alone. However, upon co-administration, there was a decrease in the aforementioned cellular responses due to JIB-04. Furthermore, JIB-04 decreased EphA2 expression, and thus, silencing efficiency of siEphA2-loaded nanoparticles was further increased with co-treatment. In conclusion, we have successfully developed a novel siRNA-loaded lipid nanoparticle for targeting EphA2. Moreover, detailed preliminary results of the effects of JIB-04, alone and in combination with siEphA2, on PCa cells and tumor spheroids were presented for the first time. Our delivery system provides high transfection efficiency and shows a great promise for targeting other genes and cancer types in further in vitro and in vivo studies.","L-Tyrosine (Tyr) is an aromatic amino acid synthesized de novo in plants and microbes downstream of the shikimate pathway. In plants, Tyr and a Tyr pathway intermediate, 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (HPP), are precursors to numerous specialized metabolites, which are crucial for plant and human health. Tyr is synthesized in the plastids by a TyrA family enzyme, arogenate dehydrogenase (ADH/TyrAa), which is feedback inhibited by Tyr. In addition to ADH enzymes, many legumes possess prephenate dehydrogenases (PDH/TyrAp), which are insensitive to Tyr and localized to the cytosol. Yet the role of PDH in legumes is currently unknown. This study isolated and characterized Tnt1-transposon mutants of MtPDH1 (pdh1) in Medicago truncatula to investigate PDH function. The pdh1 mutants lacked PDH transcript, PDH activity, and displayed little aberrant morphological phenotypes under standard growth conditions providing genetic evidence that MtPDH1 is responsible for the PDH activity detected in M. truncatula. Though plant PDH enzymes and activity have been specifically found in legumes, nodule number and nitrogenase activity of pdh1 mutants were not significantly reduced compared to wild-type (Wt) during symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Although Tyr levels were not significantly different between Wt and mutants under standard conditions, when carbon flux was increased by shikimate precursor feeding, mutants accumulated significantly less Tyr than Wt. These data suggest that MtPDH1 is involved in Tyr biosynthesis when the shikimate pathway is stimulated, and possibly linked to unidentified legume-specific specialized metabolism.","Change in climate of the entire globe due to elevated temperature and minimum annual rainfall in barren zone frequently leads to salinity of soil. The current study was aimed to evaluate the importance of sugar beet extract (SBE) as a bio-stimulant to improve the adverse damages of induced salinity stress (40mM) on growth, oosmolytes and antioxidant defense system of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). Pot experiment was carried in green house under different concentrations of SBE (10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%) pre-soaked seeds of Hordeum vulgare for 5 hours SBE was analyzed for glycine betaine (100mmol/kg), betalains (1.3mg/l), phenolics (1.30g/100ml), flavonoids (0.59mg/ml), carotenoids (0.23ml/100ml), vitamin E (0.002%), vitamin C (8.04g/100ml), sugar (8g/100ml), protein (1.39mg/100ml), and oxalic acid (38mg/100ml) while Ca (13.72mg/l), Mg (7.121 mg/l) and K (11.45mg/l) contents were also determined. We found significant improvement in germination parameters of Hordeum vulgare L. via SB extract on coefficient of velocity of emergence (CVE), mean emergence time (MET), germination energy (GE), timson germination index (TGI), germination rate index (GRI) and time to 50% emergence (E50) under induced salinity stress. However, photosynthetic pigments, e.g., chlorophyll and carotenoids were enhanced using 40% SB extract, soluble sugar, protein, proline, POD, MDA with 50% SB extract while SOD and H2O2 in 20% SBE, respectively. Our findings suggested that SB extract promotes both agronomical and physiological attributes, is a positive way to enhance our economy by increasing crop yields in arid and semi-arid areas along with plant tolerance to under induced salinity stress.","Low temperature is one of the important environmental factors that affect rice growth and yield. To better understand the japonica rice responses to cold stress, isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) labeling based quantitative proteomics approach was used to detected changes in protein level. Two-week-old seedlings of the cold tolerance rice variety Kongyu131 were treated at 8\u00b0C for 24, 48 and 72 h, then the total proteins were extracted from tissues and used for quantitative proteomics analysis. A total of 5082 proteins were detected for quantitative analysis, of which 289 proteins were significantly regulated, consisting of 169 uniquely up-regulated proteins and 125 uniquely down-regulated proteins in cold stress groups relative to control group. Functional analysis revealed most of regulation proteins involved in photosynthesis, metabolic pathway, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and carbon metabolism. Western blot analysis showed that protein regulation was consistent with the iTRAQ data. The corresponding genes of 25 regulation proteins were used for quantitative real time PCR analysis, and the results showed that the mRNA level was not always parallel to the corresponding protein level. The importance of our study is providing new insights into cold stress responses in rice on proteomic aspect.","Reliable detection of disseminated tumor cells and of the biodistribution of tumor-targeting therapeutic antibodies within the entire body has long been needed to better understand and treat cancer metastasis. Here, we developed an integrated pipeline for automated quantification of cancer metastases and therapeutic antibody targeting, named DeepMACT. First, we enhanced the fluorescent signal of tumor cells more than 100-fold by applying the vDISCO method to image single cancer cells in intact transparent mice. Second, we developed deep learning algorithms for automated quantification of metastases with an accuracy matching human expert manual annotation. Deep learning-based quantifications in a model of spontaneous metastasis using human breast cancer cells allowed us to systematically analyze clinically relevant features such as size, shape, spatial distribution, and the degree to which metastases are targeted by a therapeutic monoclonal antibody in whole mice. DeepMACT can thus considerably improve the discovery of effective therapeutic strategies for metastatic cancer.","The hippocampus supports episodic memory via interaction with a distributed brain network. Previous experiments using network-targeted noninvasive brain stimulation have identified episodic memory enhancements and modulation of activity within the hippocampal network. However, mechanistic insights were limited because these effects were measured long after stimulation and therefore could have reflected various neuroplastic aftereffects with extended timecourses. In this experiment with human subjects of both sexes, we tested for immediate stimulation impact on encoding-related activity of the hippocampus and immediately adjacent medial-temporal cortex by delivering theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (TBS) concurrent with fMRI, as an immediate impact of stimulation would suggest an influence on neural activity. We reasoned that TBS would be particularly effective for influencing the hippocampus because rhythmic neural activity in the theta band is associated with hippocampal memory processing. First, we demonstrated that it is possible to obtain robust fMRI correlates of task-related activity during concurrent TBS. We then identified immediate effects of TBS on encoding of visual scenes. Brief volleys of TBS targeting the hippocampal network increased activity of the targeted (left) hippocampus during scene encoding and increased subsequent recollection. Stimulation did not influence activity during an intermixed numerical task with no memory demand. Control conditions using beta-band and out-of-network stimulation also did not influence hippocampal activity or recollection. TBS targeting the hippocampal network therefore immediately impacted hippocampal memory processing. This suggests direct, beneficial influence of stimulation on hippocampal neural activity related to memory and supports the role of theta-band activity in human episodic memory.","Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) treatment has been proposed as a potentially innovative therapeutic tool in the biomedical field, notably for cancer due to its proposed toxic selectivity on cancer cells versus healthy cells. In the present study, we addressed the relevance of three-dimensional organoid technology to investigate the biological effects of CAP on normal epithelial stem cells and tumor cells isolated from mouse small intestine. CAP treatment exerted dose-dependent cytotoxicity on normal organoids and induced major transcriptomic changes associated with global response to oxidative stress, fetal-like regeneration reprogramming and apoptosis-mediated cell death. Moreover, we explored the potential selectivity of CAP on tumor-like Apc-deficient versus normal organoids in the same genetic background. Unexpectedly, tumor organoids exhibited higher resistance to CAP treatment, correlating with higher antioxidant activity at baseline as compared to normal organoids. This pilot study suggests that the ex vivo culture system could be a relevant alternative model to further investigate translational medical applications of CAP technology.","The acclimation mechanism of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to nitric oxide (NO) was studied by exposure to S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), a NO donor. Treatment with 0.1 or 0.3 mM SNAP transiently inhibited photosynthesis within 1 h, followed by a recovery without growth impairment, while 1.0 mM SNAP treatment caused irreversible photosynthesis inhibition and mortality. The SNAP effects are avoided in the presence of the NO scavenger, 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-l-oxyl-3-oxide (cPTIO). RNA-seq, qPCR, and biochemical analyses were conducted to decode the metabolic shifts under sub-lethal NO stress by exposure to 0.3 mM SNAP in the presence or absence of 0.4 mM cPTIO. These findings revealed that the acclimation to NO stress comprises a temporally orchestrated implementation of metabolic processes: 1. trigger of NO scavenging elements to reduce NO level; 2. prevention of photo-oxidative risk through photosynthesis inhibition and antioxidant defense system induction; 3. acclimation to nitrogen and sulfur shortage; 4. degradation of damaged proteins through protein trafficking machinery (ubiquitin, SNARE, and autophagy) and molecular chaperone system for dynamic regulation of protein homeostasis. NO increased NADPH oxidase activity and respiratory burst oxidase-like 2 (RBOL2) transcript abundance, which were not observed in the rbol2 insertion mutant. Changes in gene expression in the rbol2 mutant and increased mortality under NO stress demonstrate that NADPH oxidase (RBOL2) is involved in the modulation of some acclimation processes (NO scavenging, antioxidant defense system, autophagy, and heat shock proteins) for Chlamydomonas to cope with NO stress. Our findings provide insight into the molecular events underlying acclimation mechanisms in Chlamydomonas to sub-lethal NO stress.","Yeast Sfh5 is an unusual member of the Sec14-like phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (PITP) family. Whereas PITPs are defined by their abilities to transfer phosphatidylinositol between membranes in vitro, and to stimulate phosphoinositide signaling in vivo, Sfh5 does not exhibit these activities. Rather, Sfh5 is a redox-active penta-coordinate high spin FeIII heme-binding protein with an unusual heme-binding arrangement that involves a co-axial tyrosine/histidine coordination strategy and a complex electronic structure connecting the open shell iron d-orbitals with three aromatic ring systems. That Sfh5 is not a PITP is supported by demonstrations that heme is not a readily exchangeable ligand, and that phosphatidylinositol-exchange activity is resuscitated in heme binding-deficient Sfh5 mutants. The collective data identify Sfh5 as the prototype of a new class of fungal hemoproteins, and emphasize the versatility of the Sec14-fold as scaffold for translating the binding of chemically distinct ligands to the control of diverse sets of cellular activities.","Herbivore natural enemies, including predators, parasitoids and parasites, protect plants by regulating herbivore populations. Some parasites can increase their transmission efficiency by manipulating host behavior. Whether natural enemies can manipulate herbivore behavior to increase top-down control, however, is unknown. Here, we investigate if and how the entomopathogenic nematode Heterorhabditis bacteriophora, an important biocontrol agent, modulates the behavior of the western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera, a major maize pest, and how these behavioral changes affect the capacity of the nematode to control the rootworm. We found that healthy rootworm larvae are attracted to nematode-infected cadavers shortly before the emergence of the next generation of nematodes. Nematode-infected rootworms release distinct volatile bouquets, including butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), which attracts rootworms to infected cadavers. In a soil setting, BHT attracts rootworms and reduces nematode resistance, resulting in increased infection rates and rootworm mortality as well as increased nematode reproductive success. Five out of seven tested insect species were found to be attracted to nematode-infected conspecifics, suggesting that attraction of healthy hosts to nematode-infected cadavers is widespread. This study reveals a new facet of the biology of entomopathogenic nematodes that increases their capacity to control a major root pest by increasing the probability of host encounters.","Alpha-tocopherols (\u03b1-toc) are crucial in protecting biological membranes against oxidation by free radicals. We investigate the behavior of \u03b1-toc molecules in lipid bilayers containing oxidized lipids by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. To verify the approach, the location and orientation of \u03b1-toc are first shown to be in agreement with previous experimental results. The simulations further show that \u03b1-toc molecules stay inside the lipid bilayer with their hydroxyl groups in contact with the bilayer surface. Interestingly, interbilayer \u03b1-toc flip-flop was observed in both oxidized and non-oxidized bilayers with significantly higher frequency in aldehyde lipid bilayer. Free energy calculations were performed and estimates of the flip-flop rates across the bilayers were determined. As the main finding, our results show that the presence of oxidized lipids leads to a significant decrease of free energy barriers and that the flip-flop rates depend on the type of oxidized lipid present. Our results suggest that \u03b1-toc molecules could potentially act as high efficacy scavengers of free radicals to protect membranes from oxidative attack and help stabilize them under oxidative stress.","Aromatase (CYP19A1) converts androgens into estrogens and is required for female sexual development and growth and development in both sexes. CYP19A1 is a member of cytochrome P450 family of heme-thiolate monooxygenases located in the endoplasmic reticulum and depends on reducing equivalents from the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate via the cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase coded by POR. Both the CYP19A1 and POR genes are highly polymorphic, and mutations in both these genes are linked to disorders of steroid biosynthesis. We have previously shown that R264C and R264H mutations in CYP19A1, as well as mutations in POR, result in a reduction of CYP19A1 activity. The R264C is a common polymorphic variant of CYP19A1, with high frequency in Asian and African populations. Polymorphic alleles of POR are found in all populations studied so far and, therefore, may influence activities of CYP19A1 allelic variants. So far, effects of variations in POR on enzymatic activities of allelic variants of CYP19A1 or any other steroid metabolizing cytochrome P450 proteins have not been studied. Here we are reporting the effects of three POR variants on the aromatase activities of two CYP19A1 variants, R264C and R264H. We used bacterially expressed and purified preparations of WT and variant forms of CYP19A1 and POR and constructed liposomes with embedded CYP19A1 and POR proteins and assayed the CYP19A1 activities using radiolabeled androstenedione as a substrate. With the WT-POR as a redox partner, the R264C-CYP19A1 showed only 15% of aromatase activity, but the R264H had 87% of aromatase activity compared to WT-CYP19A1. With P284L-POR as a redox partner, R264C-CYP19A1 lost all activity but retained 6.7% of activity when P284T-POR was used as a redox partner. The R264H-CYP19A1 showed low activities with both the POR-P284L as well as the POR-P284T. When the POR-Y607C was used as a redox partner, the R264C-CYP19A1 retained around 5% of CYP19A1 activity. Remarkably, The R264H-CYP19A1 had more than three-fold higher activity compared to WT-CYP19A1 when the POR-Y607C was used as the redox partner, pointing towards a beneficial effect. The slight increase in activity of R264C-CYP19A1 with the P284T-POR and the three-fold increase in activity of the R264H-CYP19A1 with the Y607C-POR point towards a conformational effect and role of protein-protein interaction governed by the R264C and R264H substitutions in the CYP19A1 as well as P284L, P284T and Y607C variants of POR. These studies demonstrate that the allelic variants of P450 when present with a variant form of POR may show different activities, and combined effects of variations in both the P450 enzymes as well as in the POR should be considered when genetic data are available. Recent trends in the whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing as diagnostic tools will permit combined evaluation of variations in multiple genes that are interdependent and may guide treatment options by adjusting therapeutic interventions based on laboratory analysis.","Aims Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is a co-factor of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), which is critical to embryonic heart development. We aimed to study the effects of sapropterin (Kuvan\u00ae), an orally active synthetic form of BH4 on eNOS uncoupling and congenital heart defects (CHDs) induced by pregestational diabetes in mice.","Maize belongs to tropical environment and is extremely sensitive to drought and chilling stress, particularly at early developmental stages. The present study investigated the individual and combine effects of drought (15% PEG-Solution) and chilling stress (15\u00b0C/12\u00b0C) on the morpho-physiological growth, osmolyte accumulation, production and regulations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the activities of antioxidants in two maize hybrids i.e., \u2018XD889\u2019 and \u2018XD319\u2019 and two inbred cultivars i.e., \u2018Yu13\u2019 and \u2018Yu37\u2019. Individual and combined drought and chilling stresses stimulated the production of O2\u25a1, H2O2, OH\u25a1 and enhanced malondialdehyde (MDA) contents which led to reduced photosynthetic pigments and morphological growth. Drought, chilling and drought + chilling stress conditions induced the compatible osmolytes, ROS detoxifying proteins and antioxidants to counterbalanced the oxidative damage. It was found that the concurrent occurrence of drought + chilling stress was more lethal for maize seedling growth than the drought and chilling individual stresses. However, the performance of hybrid maize cultivars (XD889 and XD319) was better than the inbred maize cultivars (Yu13 and Yu37). For improving tolerance to individual and concurrent drought and chilling stress in maize, future research focus should be on developing genetically engineer plants that have the ability to generate specific response against sub-optimal temperature and water deficit conditions.","Myo-inositol oxygenase (MIOX) is the first enzyme in the inositol route to ascorbate (L-ascorbic acid, AsA, vitamin C). We have previously shown that Arabidopsis plants constitutively expressing MIOX have elevated foliar AsA content and displayed enhanced growth rate, biomass accumulation, and increased tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses. In this work, we used a combination of transcriptomics, chromatography, microscopy, and physiological measurements to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms mediating the phenotype of the AtMIOX4 line. Transcritpomic analysis revealed increased expression of genes involved in auxin synthesis, hydrolysis, transport, and metabolism, which are supported by elevated auxin levels both in vitro and in vivo, and confirmed by assays demonstrating their effect on epidermal cell elongation in the AtMIOX4 over-expresser plants. Additionally, we detected up-regulation of transcripts involved in photosynthesis that was validated by increased efficiency of the photosystem II and proton motive force. We also found increased expression of amylase leading to higher intracellular glucose levels. Multiple gene families conferring plants tolerance to cold, water limitation, and heat stresses were found to be elevated in the AtMIOX4 line. Interestingly, the high AsA plants also displayed up-regulation of transcripts and hormones involved in defense including jasmonates, defensin, glucosinolates, and transcription factors that are known to be important for biotic stress tolerance. These results overall indicate that elevated levels of auxin and glucose, and enhanced photosynthetic efficiency in combination with up-regulation of abiotic stresses response genes underly the higher growth rate and abiotic stresses tolerance phenotype of the AtMIOX4 over-expressers.","The Absence of bc1 Complex (ABC1) is an ancient, atypical protein kinase family that emerged prior to the archaeal-eubacterial divergence. Loss-of-function mutants in ABC1 genes are linked to respiratory defects in microbes and humans, and to compromised photosynthetic performance and stress tolerance in plants. However, demonstration of protein kinase activity remains elusive, hampering their study. Here, we investigate a homolog from Arabidopsis thaliana, AtABC1K6, and demonstrate in vitro protein kinase activity as autophosphorylation, which we replicate with a human ABC1 ortholog. We show that AtABC1K6 protein kinase activity requires an atypical buffer composition, including Mn2+ as divalent cation co-factor and a low salt concentration. AtABC1K6 associates with plastoglobule lipid droplets of A. thaliana chloroplasts, along with five paralogs. Protein kinase activity associated with isolated A. thaliana plastoglobules was inhibited at higher salt concentrations, but could accommodate Mg2+ as well as Mn2+, indicating salt sensitivity, but not the requirement for Mn2+, may be a general characteristic of ABC1s. Loss of functional AtABC1K6 impairs the developmental transition from vegetative to reproductive growth. This phenotype is complemented by the wild-type sequence of AtABC1K6 but not by a kinase-dead point mutant in the unique Ala-triad of the ATP-binding pocket, demonstrating the physiological relevance of the protein\u2019s kinase activity. We suggest that ABC1s are bona fide protein kinases with a unique regulatory mechanism. Our results open the door to detailed functional and mechanistic studies of ABC1s and plastoglobules.","Several species of the soil borne fungus of the genus Trichoderma are known to be versatile, opportunistic plant symbionts, and are the most successful biocontrol agents used in today\u2019s agriculture. To be successful in the field conditions, the fungus must endure varying climatic conditions. Studies have indicated that high atmospheric temperature coupled with low humidity is a major limitation for the inconsistent performance of Trichoderma under field conditions. Understanding the molecular modulation associated with such Trichoderma that persist and deliver under abiotic stress condition will aid in exploiting the worth of these organisms for such use. In this study, comparative proteomic analysis using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF-TOF) mass spectrometry was used to identify proteins associated with thermotolerance in two thermotolerant isolates of Trichoderma\u2014T. longibrachiatum 673, TaDOR673 and T. asperellum 7316, TaDOR7316\u2014and 32 differentially expressed proteins were identified. Sequence homology and conserved domains were used to identify these proteins and to assign probable function to them. Thermotolerant isolate, TaDOR673, seemed to employ the stress signaling MAPK pathways and heat shock response pathways to combat the stress condition whereas the moderately tolerant isolate, TaDOR7316, seemed to adapt to high temperature conditions by reducing the accumulation of mis-folded proteins through unfolded protein response pathway and autophagy. Also, there were unique as well as common proteins that were differentially expressed in the two isolates studied.","Microbial interactions shape the structure and function of microbial communities with profound consequences for biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem health. Yet, most interaction mechanisms are studied only in model systems and their prevalence is unknown. To systematically explore the functional and interaction potential of sequenced marine bacteria, we developed a new trait-based approach, and applied it to 473 complete genomes (248 genera), representing a significant fraction of marine microbial communities. We identified genome functional clusters (GFCs) which condense bacterial diversity into groups with potentially common ecology and life history. Most GFCs revealed unique combinations of interaction traits, some widely distributed (e.g., antimicrobial activity), others less common (e.g., production of siderophores and phytohormones, biosynthesis and export of specific B vitamins). Specific GFCs, comprising Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria, are predicted to preferentially interact synergistically and/or antagonistically with bacteria and phytoplankton. Moreover, linked trait clusters (LTCs) identify traits that may have evolved together and point to specific modes of interactions. Our approach translates multidimensional genomic information into an atlas of marine bacteria and their ecosystem functions, relevant for understanding the fundamental rules that govern community assembly and dynamics.","Crop load management is an important preharvest factor to balance yield, quality, and maturation in peach. However, few studies have addressed how preharvest factors impact metabolism on fruit of equal maturity. An experiment was conducted to understand how carbon competition impacts fruit internal quality and metabolism in \u2018Cresthaven\u2019 peach trees by imposing distinct thinning severities. Fruit quality was evaluated at three developmental stages (S2, S3, S4), while controlling for equal maturity using non-destructive near-infrared spectroscopy. Non-targeted metabolite profiling was used to characterize fruit at each developmental stage from trees that were unthinned (carbon starvation) or thinned (carbon sufficiency). Carbon sufficiency resulted in significantly higher fruit dry matter content and soluble solids concentration at harvest when compared to the carbon starved, underscoring the true impact of carbon manipulation on fruit quality. Significant differences in the fruit metabolome between treatments were observed at S2 when phenotypes were similar, while less differences were observed at S4 when the carbon sufficient fruit exhibited a superior phenotype. This suggests a potential metabolic priming effect on fruit quality when carbon is sufficiently supplied during early fruit growth and development. In particular, elevated levels of catechin may suggest a link between secondary/primary metabolism and fruit quality development.","Proteins of the lipocalin family are known to bind small hydrophobic ligands and are involved in various physiological processes ranging from lipid transport to oxidative stress responses. The genome of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum contains a single protein PF3D7_0925900 with a lipocalin signature. Using crystallography and small-angle X-ray scattering, we show that the protein has a tetrameric structure of typical lipocalin monomers, hence we name it P. falciparum lipocalin (PfLCN), the first lipocalin structurally and functionally characterized in a single-celled eukaryote. We show that PfLCN is expressed in the intraerythrocytic stages of the parasite and localizes to the parasitophorous and food vacuoles. Conditional knockdown of PfLCN impairs parasite development, which can be rescued by treatment with the radical scavenger Trolox or by temporal inhibition of hemoglobin digestion. This suggests a key function of PfLCN in counteracting oxidative stress induced cell damage during multiplication of parasites within red blood cells.","The Nurses\u2019 Health Study (NHS), Nurses\u2019 Health Study II (NHSII), Health Professionals Follow Up Study (HPFS) and the Physicians Health Study (PHS) have collected detailed longitudinal data on multiple exposures and traits for approximately 310,000 study participants over the last 35 years. Over 160,000 study participants across the cohorts have donated a DNA sample and to date, 20,691 subjects have been genotyped as part of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of twelve primary outcomes. However, these studies utilized six different GWAS arrays making it difficult to conduct analyses of secondary phenotypes or share controls across studies. To allow for secondary analyses of these data, we have created three new datasets merged by platform family and performed imputation using a common reference panel, the 1,000 Genomes Phase I release. Here, we describe the methodology behind the data merging and imputation and present imputation quality statistics and association results from two GWAS of secondary phenotypes (body mass index (BMI) and venous thromboembolism (VTE)).","Inherited genetic variation impacts local gene expression and DNA methylation in humans. Expression and methylation quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs and cis-mQTLs) often occur at the same genomic location, suggesting a common causal variant and shared mechanism. Using DNA and RNA from peripheral blood of Bangladeshi individuals, we use \u201cco-localization\u201d methods to identify 3,695 eQTL-mQTL pairs that are likely to share a causal variant. Using partial correlation analysis and mediation analysis, we identify &gt;500 pairs with evidence of a causal relationships between expression and methylation (i.e., shared mechanism) with many additional pairs that we are underpowered to detect. These co-localized pairs are enriched for SNPs showing opposite effects on expression and methylation, although a many affect multiple CpGs in opposite directions. Evidence of shared SNP-age interaction also supports shared mechanisms for two eQTL-mQTL pairs. This work demonstrates the pervasiveness of co-regulated expression and methylation traits in the human genome. This approach can be applied to other types of molecular QTLs to enhance our understanding of regulatory mechanisms.","Sweet corn is consistently one of the most highly consumed vegetables in the U.S., providing a valuable opportunity to increase nutrient intake through biofortification. Significant variation for carotenoid (provitamin A, lutein, zeaxanthin) and tocochromanol (vitamin E, antioxidants) levels is present in temperate sweet corn germplasm, yet previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of these traits have been limited by low statistical power and mapping resolution. Here, we employed a high-quality transcriptomic dataset collected from fresh sweet corn kernels to conduct transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) and transcriptome prediction studies for 39 carotenoid and tocochromanol traits. In agreement with previous GWAS findings, TWAS detected significant associations for four causal genes, \u03b2-carotene hydroxylase (crtRB1), lycopene epsilon cyclase (lcyE), \u03b3-tocopherol methyltransferase (vte4), and homogentisate geranylgeranyltransferase (hggt1) on a transcriptome-wide level. Pathway-level analysis revealed additional associations for deoxy-xylulose synthase2 (dxs2), diphosphocytidyl methyl erythritol synthase2 (dmes2), cytidine methyl kinase1 (cmk1), and geranylgeranyl hydrogenase1 (ggh1), of which, dmes2, cmk1, and ggh1 have not previously been identified through maize association studies. Evaluation of prediction models incorporating genome-wide markers and transcriptome-wide abundances revealed a trait-dependent benefit to the inclusion of both genomic and transcriptomic data over solely genomic data, but both transcriptome- and genome-wide datasets outperformed a priori candidate gene-targeted prediction models for most traits. Altogether, this study represents an important step towards understanding the role of regulatory variation in the accumulation of vitamins in fresh sweet corn kernels.","Maize enriched in provitamin A carotenoids could be key in combatting vitamin A deficiency in human populations relying on maize as a food staple. Consumer studies indicate that orange maize may be regarded as novel and preferred. This study identifies genes of relevance for grain carotenoid concentrations and kernel color, through simultaneous dissection of these traits in 10 families of the U.S. maize nested association mapping population that have yellow to orange grain. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified via joint-linkage analysis, with phenotypic variation explained for individual kernel color QTL ranging from 2.4 to 17.5%. These QTL were cross-analyzed with significant marker-trait associations in a genome-wide association study that utilized \u223c27 million variants. Nine genes were identified: four encoding activities upstream of the core carotenoid pathway, one at the pathway branchpoint, three within the \u03b1- or \u03b2-pathway branches, and one encoding a carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase. Of these, three exhibited significant pleiotropy between kernel color and one or more carotenoid traits. Kernel color exhibited moderate positive correlations with \u03b2-branch and total carotenoids and negligible correlations with \u03b1-branch carotenoids. These findings can be leveraged to simultaneously achieve desirable kernel color phenotypes and increase concentrations of provitamin A and other priority carotenoids.","Stony coral tissue loss disease, first observed in Florida in 2014, has now spread along the entire Florida Reef Tract and on reefs in many Caribbean countries. The disease affects a variety of coral species with differential outcomes, and in many instances results in whole-colony mortality. We employed untargeted metabolomic profiling of Montastraea cavernosa corals affected by stony coral tissue loss disease to identify metabolic markers of disease. Herein, extracts from apparently healthy, diseased, and recovered corals, Montastraea cavernosa, collected at a reef site near Ft. Lauderdale, Florida were subjected to liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry-based metabolomics. Unsupervised principal component analysis reveals wide variation in metabolomic profiles of healthy corals of the same species, which differ from diseased corals. Using a combination of supervised and unsupervised data analyses tools, we describe metabolite features that explain variation between the apparently healthy corals, between diseased corals, and between the healthy and the diseased corals. By employing a culture-based approach, we assign sources of a subset of these molecules to the endosymbiotic dinoflagellates, Symbiodiniaceae. Specifically, we identify various endosymbiont-specific lipid classes, such as betaine lipids, glycolipids, and tocopherols, which differentiate samples taken from apparently healthy corals and diseased corals. Given the variation observed in metabolite fingerprints of corals, our data suggests that metabolomics is a viable approach to link metabolite profiles of different coral species with their susceptibility and resilience to numerous coral diseases spreading through reefs worldwide.","Gene essentiality studies have been performed on numerous bacterial pathogens, but essential gene sets have been determined for only a few plant-associated bacteria. Pseudomonas protegens Pf-5 is a plant-commensal, biocontrol bacteria that can control disease-causing pathogens on a wide range of crops. Work on Pf-5 has mostly focused on secondary metabolism and biocontrol genes, but genome-wide approaches such as high-throughput transposon mutagenesis have not yet been used in this species. Here we generated a dense P. protegens Pf-5 transposon mutant library and used transposon-directed insertion site sequencing (TraDIS) to identify 446 genes essential for growth on rich media. Genes required for fundamental cellular machinery were enriched in the essential gene set, while genes related to nutrient biosynthesis, stress responses and transport were under-represented. Comparison of the essential gene sets of Pf-5 and P. aeruginosa PA14, an opportunistic human pathogen, provides insight into the biological processes important for their different lifestyles. Key differences include cytochrome c biogenesis, formation of periplasmic disulfide bonds, lipid biosynthesis, ribonuclease activity, lipopolysaccharides and cell surface structures. Comparison of the Pf-5 in silico predicted and in vitro determined essential gene sets highlighted the essential cellular functions that are over- and underestimated by each method. Expanding essentiality studies into bacteria with a range of lifestyles can improve our understanding of the biological processes important for survival and growth in different environmental niches.","Cyanobacteria are natural enormous sources of various biologically active compounds with great contributions in different industries. This study aimed to introduce molecular and biochemical characterization for four novel cyanobacterial isolates obtained from Egyptian wastewater canals. Besides, In vitro biological activity of these isolates and their potential ability to take up nutrients and heavy metals from wastewater were examined. The obtained accession numbers were KY250420.1, KY321359.1, KY296359.1 and KU373076.1 for Nostoc calcicola, Leptolyngbya sp, Nostoc sp, and Nostoc sp, respectively. The isolate Leptolyngbya sp (KY321359.1) showed the lowest identity (90%) with other deposited sequences in database. While the isolate Nostoc sp (KU373076.1) showed the highest total phenolic content as well as the highest levels of caffeic, ferulic and gallic acids. Consequently, it appeared the highest antioxidant scavenging activity. All cyanobacterial isolates revealed potent ability to take up nutrients and heavy metals from wastewater. Generally, this study provides a taxonomic and molecular evidence for four novel cyanobacterial isolates with antioxidant activity and potent phycoremediation ability.","","Mitochondrial dysfunction drives the development of vascular endothelial dysfunction in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) with increased fragmentation of mitochondrial networks from increased Fis1 expression; whether suppressing or blocking Fis1 expression or activity can reverse endothelial dysfunction remains unknown. To address this question, resistance arterioles from healthy humans and those with T2DM were transfected with Fis1 siRNA and exposed to normal glucose, low glucose or high glucose conditions. Fis1 knockdown improved endothelium dependent vasodilation in T2DM arterioles, and blocked high- and low-glucose impairment in healthy vessels. Fis1 knockdown preserved NO bioavailability and improved endothelial layer integrity of cells exposed to high or low glucose. Fis1 knockdown had no significant effect on the expression of other mitochondrial dynamics or autophagy proteins, and had no effect on endothelial cell metabolism suggesting its suitability for pharmacological inhibition. For this, we designed pep213 to inhibit Fis1 activity (Kd ~3-7 \u03bcM) and demonstrate its specificity by NMR. Application of a cell permeant pep213 improved endothelium-dependent vasodilation in T2DM and non-T2DM vessels exposed to high glucose in an NO-dependent manner suggesting that targeting Fis1 may reduce vascular complications in T2DM.","Tocochromanols (tocopherols and tocotrienols, collectively vitamin E) are lipid-soluble antioxidants important for both plant fitness and human health. The main dietary sources of vitamin E are seed oils that often accumulate high levels of tocopherol isoforms with lower vitamin E activity. The tocochromanol biosynthetic pathway is conserved across plant species but an integrated view of the genes and mechanisms underlying natural variation of tocochromanol levels in seed of most cereal crops remains limited. To address this issue, we utilized the high mapping resolution of the maize Ames panel of \u223c1,500 inbred lines scored with 12.2 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms to generate metabolomic (mature grain tocochromanols) and transcriptomic (developing grain) data sets for genetic mapping. By combining results from genome- and transcriptome-wide association studies, we identified a total of 13 candidate causal gene loci, including five that had not been previously associated with maize grain tocochromanols: four biosynthetic genes (arodeH2 paralog, dxs1, vte5, and vte7) and a plastid S-adenosyl methionine transporter (samt1). Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping of these 13 gene loci revealed that they are predominantly regulated by cis-eQTL. Through a joint statistical analysis, we implicated cis-acting variants as responsible for co-localized eQTL and GWAS association signals. Our multi-omics approach provided increased statistical power and mapping resolution to enable a detailed characterization of the genetic and regulatory architecture underlying tocochromanol accumulation in maize grain and provided insights for ongoing biofortification efforts to breed and/or engineer vitamin E and antioxidant levels in maize and other cereals.","Organisms in the wild can acquire disease- and stress-resistance traits that outstrip the programs endogenous to humans. Finding the molecular basis of such natural resistance characters is a key goal of evolutionary genetics. Standard statistical-genetic methods toward this end can perform poorly in organismal systems that lack high rates of meiotic recombination, like Caenorhabditis worms. Here we discovered unique ER stress resistance in a wild Kenyan C. elegans isolate, which in inter-strain crosses was passed by hermaphrodite mothers to hybrid offspring. We developed an unbiased version of the reciprocal hemizygosity test, RH-seq, to explore the genetics of this parent-of-origin-dependent phenotype. Among top-scoring gene candidates from a partial-coverage RH-seq screen, we focused on the neuronally-expressed, cuticlin-like gene cutl-24 for validation. In gene disruption and controlled crossing experiments, we found that cutl-24 was required in Kenyan hermaphrodite mothers for ER stress tolerance in their inter-strain hybrid offspring; cutl-24 was also a contributor to the trait in purebred backgrounds. These data establish the Kenyan strain allele of cutl-24 as a determinant of a natural stress-resistant state, and they set a precedent for the dissection of natural trait diversity in invertebrate animals without the need for a panel of meiotic recombinants.","The development of Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) causes dysfunction of the frontal cortex, which contributes to hallmark motor symptoms and is regarded as one of the primary causes of the affective and cognitive impairments observed in PD. Treatment with L-DOPA alleviates motor symptoms but has mixed efficacy in restoring normal cognitive functions, which is further complicated by the psychoactive effects of the drug. In this study, we investigated how L-DOPA affects gene expression in the frontal cortex in an animal model of unilateral PD. We performed an RNA-seq analysis of gene expression in the frontal cortex of rats with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced unilateral dopaminergic lesion that were treated with L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), for 2 weeks. We used analysis of variance to identify differentially expressed genes and found 48 genes with significantly altered transcript abundance after L-DOPA treatment. We also performed a weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA), which resulted in the detection of 5 modules consisting of genes with similar expression patterns. The analyses led to three primary observations. First, the changes in gene expression induced by L-DOPA were bilateral, although only one hemisphere was lesioned. Second, the changes were not restricted to neurons but also appeared to emerge in immune or endothelial cells. Finally, comparisons with databases of drug-induced gene expression signatures revealed multiple nonspecific effects, which indicates that a part of the observed response is a common pattern activated by multiple types of pharmaceuticals in different target tissues. Taken together, our results identify cellular mechanisms in the frontal cortex that are involved in the response to L-DOPA treatment.","Wild relatives of tomato are a valuable source of natural variation in tomato breeding, as many can be hybridized to the cultivated species (Solanum lycopersicum). Several, including Solanum lycopersicoides, have been crossed to S. lycopersicum for the development of ordered introgression lines (ILs). Despite the utility of these wild relatives and their associated ILs, limited finished genomes have been produced to aid genetic and genomic studies. We have generated a chromosome-scale genome assembly for Solanum lycopersicoides LA2951 using PacBio sequencing, Illumina, and Hi-C. We identified 37,938 genes based on Illumina and Isoseq and compared gene function to the available cultivated tomato genome resources, in addition to mapping the boundaries of the S. lycopersicoides introgressions in a set of cv. VF36 x LA2951 introgression lines (IL). The genome sequence and IL map will support the development of S. lycopersicoides as a model for studying fruit nutrient/quality, pathogen resistance, and environmental stress tolerance traits that we have identified in the IL population and are known to exist in S. lycopersicoides.","One sentence summary Excessive N nutrition leads to ROS accumulation, and requires the function of major transcriptional regulators to maintain plants under physiological conditions.","Variation in strigolactone composition in sorghum root exudates underlies its resistance to the parasitic weed, Striga hermonthica. Root exudates of the Striga susceptible variety Shanqui Red (SQR) contain primarily 5-deoxystrigol, which has a high efficiency of inducing Striga germination. SRN39 roots primarily exude orobanchol, leading to reduced Striga germination and making this variety resistant to Striga. This structural diversity in exuded strigolactones is determined by the polymorphism in the LGS1 (LOW GERMINATION STIMULANT 1) locus. Yet, the effects of the lgs1 mutation as well as the consequences of the vast genetic diversity between SQR and SRN39 have not been addressed in terms of growth and development. Here, we demonstrate additional consequences of LGS1 loss-of-function by phenotypic and molecular characterization. A suite of genes related to metabolism was differentially expressed between SQR and SRN39. Increased levels of gibberellin precursors in SRN39 were accompanied with its slower growth rate and developmental delay and we observed an overall increased SRN39 biomass. The slow-down in growth and differences in transcriptome profiles of SRN39 were strongly associated with plant age. Additionally, analyses of multiple LGS1 loss-of-function genotypes indicated that strigolactone stereochemistry influences root system architecture. In summary, we demonstrate that the consequences of the lgs1 mutation reach further than the changes in strigolactone profile in the root exudate and translate into alterations in growth and development.","The possibility to combine smaller units of meaning (e.g., words) to create new and more complex meanings (e.g., phrases and sentences) is a fundamental feature of human language. In the present project, we investigated how the brain supports the semantic and syntactic composition of two-word adjective-noun phrases in Dutch, using magnetoencephalography (MEG). The present investigation followed up on previous studies reporting a composition effect in the left anterior temporal lobe (LATL) when comparing neural activity at nouns combined with adjectives, as opposed to nouns in a non-compositional context. The first aim of the present study was to investigate whether this effect, as well as its modulation by noun specificity and adjective class, can also be observed in Dutch. A second aim was to investigate to what extent these effects may be driven by syntactic composition rather than primarily by semantic composition as was previously proposed. To this end, a novel condition was administered in which participants saw nouns combined with pseudowords lacking meaning but agreeing with the nouns in terms of grammatical gender, as real adjectives would. We failed to observe a composition effect or its modulation in both a confirmatory analysis (focused on the cortical region and time-window where it has previously been reported) and in exploratory analyses (where we tested multiple regions and an extended potential time-window of the effect). A syntactically driven composition effect was also not observed in our data. We do, however, successfully observe an independent, previously reported effect on single word processing in our data, confirming that our MEG data processing pipeline does meaningfully capture language processing activity by the brain. The failure to observe the composition effect in LATL is surprising given that it has been previously reported in multiple studies. Reviewing all previous studies investigating this effect, we propose that materials and a task involving imagery might be necessary for this effect to be observed. In addition, we identified substantial variability in the regions of interest analysed in previous studies, which warrants additional checks of robustness of the effect. Further research should identify limits and conditions under which this effect can be observed. The failure to observe specifically a syntactic composition effect in such minimal phrases is less surprising given that it has not been previously reported in MEG data.","Vitamin A deficiency remains prevalent in parts of Asia, Latin America, and sub-Saharan Africa where maize is a food staple. Extensive natural variation exists for carotenoids in maize grain; to understand its genetic basis, we conducted a joint linkage and genome-wide association study in the U.S. maize nested association mapping panel. Eleven of the 44 detected quantitative trait loci (QTL) were resolved to individual genes. Six of these were correlated expression and effect QTL (ceeQTL), showing strong correlations between RNA-seq expression abundances and QTL allelic effect estimates across six stages of grain development. These six ceeQTL also had the largest percent phenotypic variance explained, and in major part comprised the three to five loci capturing the bulk of genetic variation for each trait. Most of these ceeQTL had strongly correlated QTL allelic effect estimates across multiple traits. These findings provide the most comprehensive genome-level understanding of the genetic and molecular control of carotenoids in any plant system, and a roadmap to accelerate breeding for provitamin A and other priority carotenoid traits in maize grain that should be readily extendable to other cereals.","Mechanosensation \u2013 by which mechanical stimuli are converted into a neuronal signal \u2013 is the basis for the sensory systems of hearing, balance, and touch. Mechanosensation is unmatched in speed and its diverse range of sensitivities, reaching its highest temporal limits with the sense of hearing; however, hair cells (HCs) and the auditory nerve (AN) serve as obligatory bottlenecks for sounds to engage the brain. Like other sensory neurons, auditory neurons use the canonical pathway for neurotransmission and millisecond-duration action potentials (APs). How the auditory system utilizes the relatively slow transmission mechanisms to achieve ultrafast speed and high audio-frequency hearing remains an enigma. Here, we address this paradox and report that the AN is mechanically sensitive, and minute mechanical displacement profoundly affects its response properties. Sound-mimicking sinusoidal mechanical and electrical current stimuli affect phase-locked responses. In a phase-dependent manner, the two stimuli can also evoke suppressive responses. We propose that mechanical sensitivity interacts with synaptic responses to shape responses in the AN, including frequency tuning and temporal phase-locking. The combination of neurotransmission and mechanical sensation to control spike patterns gives the AN a secondary receptor role, an emerging theme in primary neuronal functions.","Background Examining inflammation-related DNA methylation alterations in blood could help elucidate the role of inflammation in lung cancer etiology and aid discovery of factors that are key to lung cancer development and progression. In a nested case-control study, we estimated the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio using a validated index, methylation-derived NLR (mdNLR), and quantified DNA methylation levels at loci previously linked with circulating concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP). We examined associations between these measures and lung cancer risk, and among the cases, lung cancer survival, using pre-diagnostic blood samples of cases (median of 14 years before diagnosis) and controls in the CLUE I/II cohorts. Our analyses controlled for self-reported smoking and methylation-predicted cumulative smoking in order to better focus our examinations on the DNA methylation marks that are informative of the immune response profile.","Background Observational studies have suggested associations between circulating antioxidant levels and many mental disorders, but evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is lacking and causal inferences have not been confirmed. The aim of this study was to explore whether genetically predicted diet-derived circulating antioxidants were causally associated with the risk of major mental disorders using Mendelian randomization (MR).","Quantifying the physiology of aging is essential for improving our understanding of age-related disease and the heterogeneity of healthy aging. Recent studies have shown that in regression models using \u201c-omic\u201d platforms to predict chronological age, residual variation in predicted age is correlated with health outcomes, and suggest that these \u201comic clocks\u201d provide measures of biological age. This paper presents predictive models for age using metabolomic profiles of cerebrospinal fluid from healthy human subjects, and finds that metabolite and lipid data are generally able to predict chronological age within 10 years. We use these models to predict the age of a cohort of subjects with Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s disease and find an increase in prediction error, potentially indicating that the relationship between the metabolome and chronological age differs with these diseases. In our analysis of control subjects, we find the carnitine shuttle, sucrose, biopterin, vitamin E metabolism, tryptophan, and tyrosine to be the most associated with age. We showcase the potential usefulness of age prediction models in a small dataset (n = 85), and discuss techniques for drift correction, missing data imputation, and regularized regression which can be used to help mitigate the statistical challenges that commonly arise in this setting. To our knowledge, this work presents the first multivariate predictive metabolomic and lipidomic models for age using mass spectrometry analysis of cerebrospinal fluid.","Background Salicylic acid (SA) is a metabolite that can be obtained from the diet via fruit and vegetable ingestion, of which increased consumption has observationally been shown to decrease risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). Whilst primary prevention trials of SA and CRC risk are lacking, there is strong evidence from clinical trials and prospective cohort studies that aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) is an effective primary and secondary chemopreventative agent. Since aspirin is rapidly deacetylated to form SA, it follows that SA may have a central role for aspirin chemoprevention. Through a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach, we aimed to address whether levels of SA affected CRC risk, and whether aspirin intake as a proxy for increased SA levels was required to identify an effect.","The interaction between inclement weather and disease acquisition is a long-recognized relationship. In the case of coccidiosis, a parasitic infestation of the intestines, wet weather is known to promote incidences in livestock. Our opportunistic investigation tracks blood chemistries of goats that were exposed to coccidian in a 100 year rain event in Oklahoma. Our results suggest a potentially patterned response of blood chemistries that may be developed into a clinical tool in the future and provide warnings for producers of the risks associated with growing incidences of excessively wet weather related to climate change.","The confirmed number of SARS-CoV-2 infections up to 30 August 2021 is 217 mil. worldwide but information about factors affecting the probability of infection or of a severe course of Covid-19 remains insufficient and often speculative. Only a small number of factors have been rigorously examined, mostly by retrospective or cross-sectional studies. We ran a preregistered study on 5,164 internet users who shared with us information about their exposure to 105 risk factors and reported being Covid negative before the beginning of the fourth wave of Covid-19 in the Czech Republic. After the fourth wave, in which 709 (13.7%) of participants were infected, we used a partial Kendall test controlled for sex, age, and urbanisation to compare the risk of infection and of a severe course of the disease in subjects who originally did and did not report exposure to particular risk factors. After the correction for multiple tests, we identified 13 factors \u2013 including male sex, lower age, blood group B, and the larger household size \u2013 that increased the risk of infection and 16 factors \u2013 including mask wearing, borreliosis in the past, use of vitamin D supplements, or rooibos drinking \u2013 that decreased it. We also identified 23 factors that increased the risk of a severe course of Covid-19 and 12 factors that decreased the risk.","Genetic variation is regarded as a prerequisite for evolution. Theoretical models suggest epigenetic information inherited independently of DNA sequence can also enable evolution. However, whether epigenetic inheritance mediates phenotypic evolution in natural populations is unknown. Here we show that natural epigenetic DNA methylation variation in gene bodies regulates genes expression, and thereby influences the natural variation of complex traits in Arabidopsis thaliana. Notably, the effects of methylation variation on phenotypic diversity and gene expression variance are comparable with those of DNA sequence polymorphism. We also identify methylation epialleles in numerous genes associated with environmental conditions in native habitats, suggesting that intragenic methylation facilitates adaptation to fluctuating environments. Our results demonstrate that methylation variation fundamentally shapes phenotypic diversity in natural populations and provides an epigenetic basis for adaptive Darwinian evolution independent of genetic polymorphism.","Background Polyethylene (PE) liners are a common bearing surface of orthopaedic prostheses. In some products, vitamin E is added to PE as a preventive measure against oxidative degradation. Ultra-high molecular weight PE (UHMWPE) wear particles contribute to periprosthetic osteolysis, a major cause of aseptic loosening. Osteocytes are an important cell type for controlling both bone mineralisation and bone resorption, and respond to UHMWPE particles by inducing both osteocytic osteolysis and support of osteoclastogenesis. Here, we examined the effects of the vitamin E analogues \u03b1-tocopherol and \u03b3-tocotrienol alone or in the context of wear particles on human osteocyte gene expression and mineralisation behaviour.","Background Observational studies have demonstrated inverse associations between vegetable intake and cardiovascular diseases. However, the results are prone to residual confounding. The separate effects of cooked and raw vegetable intake remain unclear. This study aims to investigate the association between cooked and raw vegetable intake with cardiovascular outcomes using Mendelian randomization (MR).","Pernicious anemia is a rare condition characterized by vitamin B12 deficiency anemia due to lack of intrinsic factor, often caused by autoimmune gastritis. Patients with pernicious anemia have a higher incidence of other autoimmune disorders, such as type 1 diabetes, vitiligo and autoimmune thyroid issues. Therefore, the disease has a clear autoimmune basis, although the genetic susceptibility factors have thus far remained poorly studied. We conducted a genome-wide association study meta-analysis in 2,166 cases and 659,516 European controls from population-based biobanks and identified genome-wide significant signals in or near the PTPN22 (rs6679677, p=1.91 \u2a2f 10\u221224, OR=1.63), PNPT1 (rs12616502, p=3.14 \u2a2f 10\u22128, OR=1.70), HLA-DQB1 (rs28414666, p=1.40 \u2a2f 10\u221216, OR=1.38), IL2RA (rs2476491, p=1.90 \u2a2f 10\u22128, OR=1.22) and AIRE (rs74203920, p=2.33 \u2a2f 10\u22129, OR=1.83) genes, thus providing the first robust associations between pernicious anemia and genetic risk factors. We further mapped the susceptibility in the HLA region to the HLA-DR15 haplotype. Analysis of associated diagnoses and disease trajectories confirm the association between pernicious anemia and thyroid issues, vitiligo, gastritis, stomach cancer, osteoporosis and other diagnoses.","The impact of nutrition on the metabolic profile of osteoporosis is incompletely characterized. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to detangle the association of fruit and vegetable (FV) intakes with osteoporosis prevalence. Dietary, anthropometric and blood plasma metabolite data were examined from the Boston Puerto Rican Osteoporosis Study, a cohort of 600 individuals (age 46-79yr). High FV intake was protective against osteoporosis prevalence. Associations of 525 plasma metabolites were assessed with fruit and vegetable intake, and separately with osteoporosis status. Several biological processes affiliated with the FV-associating metabolites, including caffeine metabolism, carnitines and fatty acids, and glycerophospholipids. For osteoporosis-associated metabolites, important processes were steroid hormone biosynthesis in women, and branched-chain amino acid metabolism in men. In all instances, the metabolite patterns differed greatly between sexes, arguing for a stratified nutrition approach in recommending FV intakes to improve bone health. Factors derived from principal components analysis of the FV intakes were correlated with the osteoporosis-associated metabolites, with high intake of dark leafy greens and berries/melons appearing protective in both sexes. These data warrant investigation into whether increasing intakes of dark leafy greens, berries and melons causally affect bone turnover and BMD among adults at risk for osteoporosis via sex-specific metabolic pathways, and how gene-diet interactions alter these sex-specific metabolomic-osteoporosis links.","Background Given its antioxidant activity, vitamin E is hypothesized to attenuate the age-related decline in pulmonary function.","Background Few studies have evaluated the association between pre-existing vitamin D deficiency (VDD) and incident TB. We assessed the impact of baseline vitamin D on TB risk.","Background and objectives White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are frequent imaging features of small vessel disease (SVD) and related to poor clinical outcomes. WMH progression over time is well described, but regression was also noted recently, although the frequency and associated factors are unknown. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to assess longitudinal intra-individual WMH volume changes in sporadic SVD.","Previous research reported that Papua New Guineans (PNG) and Australians contain introgressions from Denisovans. Here we present a genome-wide analysis of Denisovan introgressions in PNG and Australians. We firstly developed a two-phase method to detect Denisovan introgressions from whole-genome sequencing data. This method has relatively high detection power (79.74%) and low false positive rate (2.44%) based on simulations. Using this method, we identified 1.34 Gb of Denisovan introgressions from sixteen PNG and four Australian genomes, in which we identified 38,877 Denisovan introgressive alleles (DIAs). We found that 78 Denisovan introgressions were under positive selection. Genes located in the 78 introgressions are related to evolutionarily important functions, such as spermatogenesis, fertilization, cold acclimation, circadian rhythm, development of brain, neural tube, face, and olfactory pit, immunity, etc. We also found that 121 DIAs are missense. Genes harboring the 121 missense DIAs are also related to evolutionarily important functions, such as female pregnancy, development of face, lung, heart, skin, nervous system, and male gonad, visual and smell perception, response to heat, pain, hypoxia, and UV, lipid transport, metabolism, blood coagulation, wound healing, aging, etc. Taken together, this study suggests that Denisovan introgressions in PNG and Australians are evolutionarily important, and may help PNG and Australians in local adaptation. In this study, we also proposed a method that could efficiently identify archaic hominin introgressions in modern non-African genomes.","Background The epidemiological literature reports inconsistent associations between consumption or circulating concentrations of micro-nutrients and breast cancer risk. We investigated associations between genetically determined concentrations of 11 micro-nutrients (beta-carotene, calcium, copper, folate, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, selenium, vitamin B6, vitamin B12 and zinc) and breast cancer risk using Mendelian randomization (MR).","Background: Epigenetic age, a robust marker of biological aging, has been associated with obesity, low-grade inflammation and metabolic diseases. However, few studies have examined associations between different epigenetic age measures and risk of lung cancer, despite great interest in finding biomarkers to assist in risk stratification for lung cancer screening. \nMethods: A nested case-control study of lung cancer from the CLUE II cohort study was conducted using incidence density sampling with 1:1 matching of controls to lung cancer cases (n=208 matched pairs). Prediagnostic blood samples were collected in 1989 (CLUE II study baseline) and stored at -70 degrees Celsius. DNA was extracted from buffy coat and DNA methylation levels were measured using Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip Arrays. Three epigenetic age acceleration (i.e., biological age is greater than chronological age) measurements (Horvath, Hannum and PhenoAge) were examined in relation to lung cancer risk using conditional logistic regression.\nResults: We did not observe associations between the three epigenetic age acceleration measurements and risk of lung cancer overall; however, inverse associations for the two Hannum age acceleration measures (intrinsic and extrinsic) were observed in men and among younger participants, but not in women or older participants. We did not observe effect modification by time from blood draw to diagnosis.  \nConclusion: Findings from this study do not support a positive association between three different biological age acceleration measures and risk of lung cancer. Additional studies are needed to address whether epigenetic age is associated with lung cancer in never smokers.","To move Alzheimer Disease (AD) research forward it is essential to collect data from large cohorts, but also make such data available to the global research community. We describe the creation of an open science dataset from the PREVENT-AD (PResymptomatic EValuation of Experimental or Novel Treatments for AD) cohort, composed of cognitively unimpaired older individuals with a parental or multiple-sibling history of AD. From 2011 to 2017, 386 participants were enrolled (mean age 63 years old \u00b1 5) for sustained investigation among whom 349 have retrospectively agreed to share their data openly. Repositories are findable through the unified interface of the Canadian Open Neuroscience Platform (https://portal.conp.ca/) and contain up to five years of longitudinal imaging data, cerebral fluid biochemistry, neurosensory capacities, cognitive, genetic, and medical information. Imaging data can be accessed openly at https://openpreventad.loris.ca while most of the other information, sensitive by nature, is accessible by qualified researchers at https://registeredpreventad.loris.ca. In addition to being a living resource for continued data acquisition, PREVENT-AD offers opportunities to facilitate understanding of AD pathogenesis.","","Little is known about how normal variation in dietary patterns in humans affects the aging process, largely because both nutrition and the physiology of aging are highly complex and multidimensional. Here, we apply the nutritional geometry framework to data from 1560 older adults followed over four years to assess how nutrient intake patterns affect the aging process. Aging was quantified via blood biomarkers integrated to measure loss of homeostasis. Additionally, we extend nutritional geometry to 19 micronutrients. Salient results include benefits of intermediate protein and vitamin E intake. Broadly, we show that there are few simple answers of \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d nutrients \u2013 optimal levels are generally intermediate, but dependent on other nutrients. Simpler linear/univariate analytical approaches are insufficient to capture such associations. We present an interactive tool to explore the results, and our approach presents a roadmap for future studies to explore the full complexity of the nutrition-aging landscape.","We investigated autosomal mosaic chromosomal alterations (mCAs) in 10,248 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases and 9,298 cancer-free controls of Chinese ancestry. Mosaic loss and copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity were associated with an increased risk of NSCLC, while mosaic gain was associated with a decreased risk of NSCLC, especially those spanning telomeres. The increased cell fraction of mCAs was also correlated with an increasing NSCLC risk in the affected individuals. Both multiplicative and additive interactions were observed between polygenic risk score (PRS) and the presence of mosaic loss, where carriers of mosaic loss events with cell fractions \u22655% among the high genetic risk group had the greatest risk for developing NSCLC. These findings suggest that mCA events may act as a new endogenous indicator for risk of NSCLC and have the potential to be jointly used with PRS to optimize risk stratification of NSCLC.","Rationale and Objectives Although neuroimaging studies suggest that the cerebral ventricle is independently associated with APOE \u03b54, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, and neuropsychological scores in aging and Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), there is no formal synthesis of these findings. We summarized the association of ventricular changes with APOE \u03b54, CSF biomarkers, and neuropsychological measures.","Background Vincristine leads to development of debilitating neuropathy in 40-45% patients with resultant compromised efficacy of chemotherapy, suboptimal treatment and worse prognostic outcome. Vitamin B6 and vitamin B12 improves non-oncological neuropathies. Therefore, this study investigated vitamin B6 and vitamin B12 to prevent vincristine- induced peripheral neuropathy (VIPN) by reducing incidence, absolute risk, relative risk, severity as well as delaying the onset.","The COVID-19 virus has infected millions of people and resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. By using the logistic regression model, we identified novel critical factors associated with COVID19 cases, death, and case fatality rates in 154 countries and in the 50 U.S. states. Among numerous factors associated with COVID-19 risk, we found that the unitary state system was counter-intuitively positively associated with increased COVID-19 cases and deaths. Blood type B was a protective factor for COVID-19 risk, while blood type A was a risk factor. The prevalence of HIV, influenza and pneumonia, and chronic lower respiratory diseases was associated with reduced COVID-19 risk. Obesity and the condition of unimproved water sources were associated with increased COVID-19 risk. Other factors included temperature, humidity, social distancing, smoking, and vitamin D intake. Our comprehensive identification of the factors affecting COVID-19 transmission and fatality may provide new insights into the COVID-19 pandemic and advise effective strategies for preventing and migrating COVID-19 spread.","Background Among middle-aged and elderly individuals, dietary habits have previously been reported to differ between patients with and without periodontal disease. However, in young adults, there are only a few reports that show a correlation between nutrient/food intake and periodontal disease. Moreover, no report has assessed the correlation between dietary habits measured by a self-administered diet history questionnaire (DHQ) and periodontal disease. Therefore, we assessed the correlation between dietary habits, determined using a DHQ, and periodontal disease in young adult women who are likely to develop a periodontal disease.","Light absorbed by chlorophylls of photosystem II and I drives oxygenic photosynthesis. Light-harvesting complexes increase the absorption cross-section of these photosystems. Furthermore, these complexes play a central role in photoprotection by dissipating the excess of absorbed light energy in an inducible and regulated fashion. In higher plants, the main light-harvesting complex is the trimeric LHCII.","Alzheimer\u2019s disease is characterized by the presence in the brain of amyloid plaques formed by the aberrant deposition of the amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2). Since many vitamins are dysregulated in this disease, we explored whether these molecules participate in protein homeostasis by modulating A\u03b2 aggregation. By screening 18 fat-soluble and water-soluble vitamins, we found that retinoic acid and \u03b1-tocopherol, two metabolites of vitamin A and vitamin E, respectively, affect A\u03b2 aggregation both in vitro and in a C. elegans model of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. We also show that effects of these two vitamin metabolites in combination can cancel each other out, suggesting that the complex composition of the cellular environment could have a protective role against protein aggregation through the simultaneous presence of aggregation promoters and inhibitors. Taken together, these results indicate that vitamins and their metabolites may be added to the list of components of the quality control system that regulate protein aggregation.","Introduction The effect of apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, particularly APOE \u03b54, the main genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer\u2019s disease (LOAD), has been widely explored in neuroimaging studies pertaining to older adults. The goal of this systematic review was to review the literature on the relationship between carriage of the APOE \u03b54 allele and grey matter (GM) changes across various age groups and its influence on neurodegeneration as evidenced by structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).","Background Humans take vitamin D supplements to reduce risk of vitamin D deficiency and reduce the risk of osteoporosis. However, it is unclear how dietary super-doses (10,000x greater than requirement) can affect vitamin D status in aged animals. Aged laying hens could be a model to compare with women in peri- or postmenopausal stages of life. The hens\u2019 bone health is physiologically taxed from egg production and they are highly susceptible to osteoporosis.","Background Additional studies on the causal effects of 3-n and 6-n polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) are warranted.","Background Intake, either as dietary components or as supplements, and blood concentrations of vitamin E, C, lycopene and carotenoids have been associated with a lower risk of incident (ischemic) stroke. However, causality cannot not be inferred from these associations. Here, we investigated causality by analyzing the associations between genetically-influenced antioxidant levels in blood and ischemic stroke using Mendelian Randomization (MR).","This study aims to systematically review and meta-analyze the nitro-oxidative stress (O&amp;NS)/antioxidant (ANTIOX) ratio in the peripheral blood of people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We searched PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science for articles published from inception until July 31, 2021. Forty-six studies on 3.798 MCI individuals and 6.063 healthy controls were included. The O&amp;NS/ANTIOX ratio was significantly higher in MCI than in controls with a Standardized Mean Difference (SMD)=0.378 (95% CI: 0.250; 0.506). MCI individuals showed increased lipid peroxidation (SMD=0.774, 95%CI: 4.416; 1.132) and O&amp;NS-associated toxicity (SMD=0.621, CI: 0.377; 0.865) and reduced glutathione (GSH) defenses (SMD=0.725, 95%CI: 0.269; 1.182) as compared with controls. MCI was also accompanied by significantly increased homocysteine (SMD=0.320, CI: 0.059; 0.581), but not protein oxidation, and lowered non-vitamin (SMD=0.347, CI: 0.168; 0.527) and vitamin (SMD=0.564, CI: 0.129; 0.999) antioxidant defenses. The results show that MCI is at least in part due to increased neuro-oxidative toxicity and suggest that treatments targeting lipid peroxidation and the GSH system may be used to treat or prevent MCI.","In the Pune Maternal Nutrition Study, low maternal vitamin B12 and high folate concentrations during pregnancy predicted adiposity and insulin resistance (diabesity) in the children. Based on these findings, we designed an RCT (PRIYA) to provide these nutrients pre-conceptionally to reduce diabesity in the offspring. The interventions included: 1) vitamin B12+multi-micronutrients and protein supplement (B12+MMN), 2) vitamin B12 alone, and 3) placebo. A total of 149 women became pregnant and delivered in the trial. We report results of RNA sequencing in the cord-blood mononuclear cells in 88 deliveries. Gene expression analysis revealed 20 differentially expressed genes (FDR &lt;0.1, a discovery threshold) between the B12+MMN and placebo groups. The enriched biological processes included: chromosome segregation, nuclear division and organelle fission. A cell cycle checkpoint gene Claspin (CLSPN) was expressed less in the B12+MMN group but proliferation markers did not differ. No difference was observed between the B12 alone and placebo groups. The B-complex vitamins are essential for nucleotide synthesis and generation of S-Adenosyl Methionine, a universal cellular methyl donor and thereby may contribute to the regulation of gene expression. Vitamins A and D, and zinc in MMN may also influence gene expression. We propose that the multi-micronutrient intervention influenced rate of progression of specific phases of cell cycle without affecting proliferation. Vitamin B12 alone was not sufficient.","The vagina contains at least a billion microbial cells, which are dominated by Lactobacilli. Here we perform metagenomic shotgun sequencing on cervical samples from 1148 women. Factors such as pregnancy, delivery histories and breast-feeding were all more important than menstrual cycle in shaping the microbiome. Bifidobacterium breve was seen with older age at sexual debut; Lactobacillus crispatus negatively correlated with pregnancy history; potential markers for lack of menstrual regularity, heavy flow, dysmenorrhea, contraceptives were also identified. Other features such as mood fluctuations and facial speckles could potentially be deduced from the vagino-cervical microbiome. Gut and oral microbiome, plasma vitamins, metals, amino acids and hormones showed associations with the vagino-cervical microbiome. Our results offer an unprecedented glimpse into the microbiota of the female reproductive tract and call for international collaborations to better understand its long-term health impact.","Background The associations between vegetable intake and metabolic risk factors remain inconsistent. This study was aimed to investigate the association between cooked and raw vegetable intake with serum lipids, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure and glycemic traits.","It is believed that eukaryotes arise from prokaryotes, which means that organelles can form in the latter. Such events, however, had not been observed previously. Here, we report the biogenesis of organelles in the endosymbiotic cyanobacterium TDX16 that escaped from its senescent/necrotic host cell of green alga Haematococcus pluvialis. In brief, organelle biogenesis in TDX16 initiated with cytoplasm compartmentalization, followed by de-compartmentalization, DNA allocation, and re-compartmentalization, as such two composite organelles-the primitive chloroplast and primitive nucleus sequestering minor and major fractions of cellular DNA respectively were formed. Thereafter, the eukaryotic cytoplasmic matrix was built up from the matrix extruded from the primitive nucleus; mitochondria were assembled in and segregated from the primitive chloroplast, whereby the primitive nucleus and primitive chloroplast matured into nucleus and chloroplast respectively; while most mitochondria turned into double-membraned vacuoles after matrix degradation. Results of pigment analyses, 16S rRNA and genome sequencing revealed that TDX16 is a phycocyanin-containing cyanobacterium resembling Chroococcidiopsis thermalis, which had acquired 9,017,401bp DNAs with 10301 genes form its host. Therefore, organelle biogenesis in TDX16 was achieved by hybridizing the acquired eukaryotic DNAs with its own ones and expressing the hybrid genome.","Purpose The Oxford WebQ is a web-based 24-hour dietary assessment method which has been used in UK Biobank and other large prospective studies. The food composition table used to calculate nutrient intakes has recently been replaced with the UK Nutrient Databank, which has food composition data closer in time to when participants completed the questionnaire, and new dietary variables were incorporated. Here we describe the updated version of the Oxford WebQ questionnaire nutrient calculation, and compare nutrient intakes with the previous version used.","Background Despite the observed associations between psychiatric disorders and nutrient intake, genetic studies are limited.","Kidney cancers are characterized by extensive metabolic reprogramming and resistance to a broad range of anti-cancer therapies. By interrogating the Cancer Therapeutics Response Portal compound sensitivity dataset, we show that cells of clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) possess a lineage-specific vulnerability to ferroptosis that can be exploited by inhibiting glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). Using genome-wide CRISPR screening and lipidomic profiling, we reveal that this vulnerability is driven by the HIF-2\u03b1\u2013HILPDA pathway by inducing a polyunsaturated fatty acyl (PUFA)-lipid-enriched cell state that is dependent on GPX4 for survival and susceptible to ferroptosis. This cell state is developmentally primed by the HNF-1\u03b2\u20131-Acylglycerol-3-Phosphate O-Acyltransferase 3 (AGPAT3) axis in the renal lineage. In addition to PUFA metabolism, ferroptosis is facilitated by a phospholipid flippase TMEM30A involved in membrane topology. Our study uncovers an oncogenesis-associated vulnerability, delineates the underlying mechanisms and suggests targeting GPX4 to induce ferroptosis as a therapeutic opportunity in ccRCC.","Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) transfers triglycerides and phospholipids and is essential for the assembly of Apolipoprotein B (ApoB)-containing lipoproteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. We have discovered a zebrafish mutant (mttpc655) expressing a C-terminal missense mutation (G863V) in Mttp, one of the two subunits of MTP, that is defective at transferring triglycerides, but retains phospholipid transfer activity. Mutagenesis of the conserved glycine in the human MTTP protein (G865V) also eliminates triglyceride but not phospholipid transfer activity. The G863V mutation reduces the production and size of ApoB-containing lipoproteins in zebrafish embryos and results in the accumulation of cytoplasmic lipid droplets in the yolk syncytial layer. However, mttpc655 mutants exhibit only mild intestinal lipid malabsorption and normal growth as adults. In contrast, zebrafish mutants bearing the previously identified mttpstl mutation (L475P) are deficient in transferring both triglycerides and phospholipids and exhibit gross intestinal lipid accumulation and defective growth. Thus, the G863V point mutation provides the first evidence that the triglyceride and phospholipid transfer functions of a vertebrate MTP protein can be separated, arguing that selective inhibition of the triglyceride transfer activity of MTP may be a feasible therapeutic approach for dyslipidemia.","Objective The Accelerator Program for Discovery in Brain Disorders using Stem Cells (ADBS) is a longitudinal study focused on collecting and analysing clinical, neuropsychological, neurophysiological, and multimodal neuroimaging data from five cohorts of patients with major psychiatric disorders from genetically high-risk families, their unaffected first-degree relatives, and healthy subjects. Here, we present a complete description of the acquisition of multimodal MRI data along with the quality assurance (QA) and quality check (QC) procedures that we are following in this study.","Hepatitis C virus (HCV) utilizes cellular factors for an efficient propagation. Ubiquitin is covalently conjugated to the substrate to alter its stability or to modulate signal transduction. In this study, we examined the importance of ubiquitination for HCV propagation. We found that inhibition of de-ubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) or overexpression of non-specific DUBs impaired HCV replication, suggesting that ubiquitination regulates HCV replication. To identify specific DUBs involved in HCV propagation, we set up an RNAi screening against DUBs and successfully identified ubiquitin-specific protease 15 (USP15) as a novel host factor for HCV propagation. Our studies showed that USP15 is involved in translation of HCV RNA and production of infectious HCV particles. In addition, deficiency of USP15 in human hepatic cell lines (Huh7 and Hep3B/miR122 cells) but not in a non-hepatic cell line (293T cells) impaired HCV propagation, suggesting that USP15 participates in HCV propagation through the regulation of hepatocyte-specific functions. Moreover, we showed that loss of USP15 had no effect on innate immune responses in vitro and in vivo. We also found that USP15-deficient Huh7 cells showed reductions in the sizes and numbers of lipid droplets (LDs), and addition of palmitic acids restored the production of infectious HCV particles. Taken together, these data suggest that USP15 participates in HCV propagation by regulating the translation of HCV RNA and formation of LDs.","Background Nutrition is a modifiable risk factor for ischemic stroke. As people age their ability to absorb some nutrients decreases, an example is vitamin B12. Older individuals with a vitamin B12 deficiency are at a higher risk for stroke and have worse outcome. However, the mechanisms through which these occur remain unknown.","In the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT), selenium supplementation (causing a median 114 \u03bcg/L increase in circulating selenium) did not lower overall prostate cancer risk, but increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer and type 2 diabetes. Mendelian randomization analysis uses genetic variants to proxy modifiable risk factors and can strengthen causal inference in observational studies. We constructed a genetic risk score comprising eleven single-nucleotide polymorphisms robustly (P&lt;5x10\u22128) associated with circulating selenium in genome-wide association studies. In a Mendelian randomization analysis of 72,729 men in the PRACTICAL Consortium (44,825 cases, 27,904 controls), 114 \u03bcg/L higher genetically-elevated circulating selenium was not associated with prostate cancer (OR: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.89-1.13). Concordant with findings from SELECT, selenium was weakly associated with advanced (including high-grade) prostate cancer (OR: 1.21; 95% CI: 0.98-1.49) and type 2 diabetes (OR: 1.18; 95% CI: 0.97-1.43; in a type 2 diabetes GWAS meta-analysis with up to 49,266 cases, 249,906 controls). Mendelian randomization mirrored the outcome of selenium supplementation in SELECT and may offer an approach for the prioritization of interventions for follow-up in large-scale randomized controlled trials.","La prima osservazione che la malnutrizione e la perdita di peso contribuiscano alla morte dei malati di cancro in maniera significativa e indipendentemente dagli effetti del tumore stesso risale a piu di 70 anni fa. Da allora l'intervento nutrizionale, inteso sia come screening sia come trattamento medico orientato alla ricerca e alla cura della malnutrizione, ha assunto sempre piu significato nella gestione della patologia tumorale. Cio sia al suo esordio sia durante la naturale evoluzione della malattia, anche quando accompagnata dai trattamenti medici convenzionali (radioterapia, chemioterapia, chirurgia e cure palliative). La nutrizione artificiale nelle sue diverse declinazioni (supplementi nutrizionali orali, nutrizione enterale e parenterale), la farmacoterapia, il protocollo enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) e l'immunonutrizione sono ad oggi gli strumenti a nostra disposizione per invertire o almeno arrestare il processo prima che sopraggiunga la cachessia. Questa breve rassegna nasce con l'intento di descrivere a che punto siamo nel trattamento nutrizionale del paziente oncologico e quali sono ad oggi le evidenze di efficacia dei vari interventi nei diversi momenti di malattia.","Introduction Bile acids (BAs) are the end products of cholesterol metabolism produced by human and gut microbiome co-metabolism. Recent evidence suggests gut microbiota influence pathological features of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) including neuroinflammation and amyloid-\u03b2 deposition.","Our aim was to investigate the effect of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) derivatives, which can be produced from the patient\u2019s own blood and have minimal side effects, on endometriosis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in the literature that studies the relationship between PRP and endometriosis. Endometriosis foci were created in the first operation. In the second operation (30th day) groups were formed. Group 1 (n= 8) was administered saline, group 2 (n= 7) leukocyte- and platelet-rich plasma (L-PRP), and group 3 (n= 8) pure platelet-rich plasma (P-PRP). Group 4 (n= 10) was used to obtain PRP. In the last operation (60th day), the endometriotic foci were measured, and then excised. There was no statistically significant difference between the pre and post volumes of the endometriotic foci, between their volume differences and volume difference rates (p &gt; .05). However, it was observed that existing implant volumes in all groups decreased statistically significantly within their own groups by the end of the experiment compared to the previous volumes (p &lt; .05). When the implants were assessed through histopathological scoring in terms of edema, vascular congestion, inflammatory cell infiltration, hemorrhage, epithelial line, and hemosiderin accumulation and immunohistochemical staining in terms of VEGF, there was no significant difference in the comparison between the groups. Although L-PRP and P-PRP generated more reduction in the endometriosis foci, they did not create any statistical differences.","The aim of our research was to examine the effects of crocin (0.5 (C0.5), 1 (C1) and 1.5 (C1.5) mM) and naringenin (50 (N50), 100 (N100) and 150 (N150) \u00b5M) in cryopreservation extender for freezing rooster semen. Sperm motility, viability, abnormalities, membrane integrity, mitochondrial activity, apoptosis status, lipid peroxidation (LP), GPX, SOD, TAC, the mRNA expression of pro-apoptotic (CASPASE 3) and anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2) genes, fertility and hatchability rate were investigated following freeze-thawing. C1 and N100 resulted in the higher (P &lt; 0.05) total motility and progressive motility in comparison to the control group. C1 and N100 improved viability, membrane integrity and reduced lipid peroxidation. We found much higher values for mitochondria activity with C1 and N100 respect to the control group. The C1 and N100 showed lower percentages of early apoptosis when compared with control group. Also, C1 and N100 had higher TAC when compared with control group. The mRNA expression of BCL-2 in the C1 and N100 group were significantly higher than that of other treatments. The expression of CASPASES 3 was significantly reduced in C1 and N100 group (P &lt; 0.05) when compared to control group. Significantly higher percentage of fertility and hatching rate were observed in C1 and N100 compared to the control group. In conclusion, crocin at 1 mM and naringenin at 100 \u00b5M seem to improve the post-thawing rooster semen quality, fertility and could protect the sperm against excessive ROS generation by reducing the pro-apoptotic (CASPASE 3) and increasing anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2) genes.","Sea cucumbers Apostichopus japonicus (3.54 \u00b1 0.01 g of wet weight) were exposed to five concentrations of dietary hexavalent chromium [0 (control), 100, 200, 400, and 800 mg Cr6+/kg dry weight] amended with K2Cr2O7 for 30 days. The bioaccumulation and immune responses [antioxidant enzymes: superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT); hydrolytic enzymes: acid phosphatase (ACP) and alkaline phosphatase (AKP)] of sea cucumbers were subsequently evaluated. This study found that the order of Cr accumulation in the experimental tissues was respiratory tree &gt; intestine &gt; body wall. Significantly lower SOD activities occurred in the 400 mg/kg group compared to that in the control group. Higher dietary Cr6+ exposure (400 and 800 mg Cr6+ /kg dry weight) did not negatively alter the CAT activities, but significantly inhibited CAT activities in 100 mg/kg group, compared to control group. ACP activities in groups 200, 400 and 800 mg/kg were significantly lower than those in control group, while no significant differences occurred in AKP activities among groups. The present study provides important information into the bioaccumulation and immune responses of the sea cucumber A. japonicus in response to chronic dietary Cr6+ exposure.","Exercise training creates a number of physical challenges to the body, the overcoming of which drives exercise adaptation. The balance between sufficient stress and recovery is a crucial, but often under-explored, area within exercise training. Genetic variation can also predispose some individuals to a greater need for recovery after exercise. In this pilot study, 18 male soccer players underwent a repeated sprint training session. Countermovement jump (CMJ) heights were recorded immediately pre-and post-training, and at 24-and 48-hours post-training. The reduction in CMJ height was greatest at all post-training time points in subjects with a larger number of gene variants associated with a reduced exercise recovery. This suggests that knowledge of genetic information can be important in individualizing recovery timings and modalities in athletes following training.","To evaluate the effects of a\u00e7ai extract (EA) on oxidative stress and inflammation induced by high glucose in cultured mouse immortalized mesangial cells (MiMC) and diabetic rats. MiMC cell viability and proliferation were determined by MTT. Extracellular and intracellular nitric oxide (NO) and intracellular ROS were also measured. The cell proteins were extracted for analysis of catalase, Nrf2, p-Nrf2, SOD-1, SOD-2, iNOS, NF-\u03baB, p-NF-\u03baB and TNF-\u03b1 expression. Male, adult Wistar rats were distributed into 3 groups: control (CTL) and diabetic (DM) rats who received water and DMEA and received 1 mL/day EA (200 mg/kg) via gavage for 8 consecutive weeks. After treatment with EA, metabolic profile, renal function and thiobarbituric acid reactives substances (TBARS) levels were evaluated, and kidneys were collected for qualitative histological analysis. EA maintained cell viability above 90% in all groups; it decreased proliferation in the HG group, both significant. NO levels, ROS generation, iNOS, NF-\u03baB, p-NF-\u03baB and TNF-\u03b1 expression were reduced significantly after 72 h of EA treatment, with significant increases for all antioxidants studied. DMEA vs DM showed a significant increase in body weight, improved kidney function and reduced TBARS excretion. EA treatment decreased proliferation, oxidative stress and inflammation in MiMC, and although a\u00e7ai did not decrease fasting glucose, it recovered the body weight and delayed the decline of renal function in the diabetic animals, suppressing the signaling of inflammatory mediators via NF-\u03baB inactivation and increasing all antioxidants studied by upregulating the Nrf2 response pathway.","Changes in hematocrit levels and erythrocyte numbers of Cyprinus carpio were determined after exposing the animals to 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 ppm chromium over 7, 15 and 30 days. Microhematocrit and hemocytometric methods were used for determining hematocrit levels and erythrocyte numbers respectively. No mortality was observed during the experiments. Hematocrit levels and erythrocyt numbers increased under the effect of metal on day 15. Hematocrit levels and erythtrocyte numbers decreased by increasing exposure periods except at 0.5 ppm chromium.","The increasing availability of fully sequenced cyanobacterial genomes opens unprecedented opportunities to investigate the manifold adaptations and functional relationships that determine the genetic content of individual bacterial species. Here, we use comparative genome analysis to investigate the cyanobacterial pan-genome based on 77 strains whose complete genome sequence is available. Our focus is the co-occurrence of likely ortholog genes, denoted as CLOGs. We conjecture that co-occurrence CLOGs is indicative of functional relationships between the respective genes. Going beyond the analysis of pair-wise co-occurrences, we introduce a novel network approach to identify modules of co-occurring ortholog genes. Our results demonstrate that these modules exhibit a high degree of functional coherence and reveal known as well as previously unknown functional relationships. We argue that the high functional coherence observed for the extracted modules is a consequence of the similar-yet-diverse nature of the cyanobacterial phylum. We provide a simple toolbox that facilitates further analysis of our results with respect to specific cyanobacterial genes of interest.","Nigella sativa, Carica papaya and Boswellia sacra are medicinal plants in the commonly used in folkloric medicine due to the presence of its immense therapeutic properties. Fifty (50) female albino mice weighing between 15-22g were divided into five groups of 10 mice each. Animal in group 1 served as control group and were administered distilled water while animal in group 2 were given 2ml of cisplatin (orally). Animal in group 3-5 were given orally; 100 mg/kg (low dose), 200 mg/kg (medium dose) and 400 mg/kg (high dose) of triherbal preparation. The feeding regimens lasted for 28 days. After 28 days, mammary gland and blood samples were collected for haematological and antioxidant analysis. The triherbal formula decreased the GSH and MDA levels of mice treated with 100 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg doses compare to control. The measurement of total protein content, SOD and CAT increased in treated animals compared to control. However, RBC (Red Blood Cell) counts significantly decreased in the low, medium and high dose groups (0.95\u00b10.08, 6.57\u00b10.08 and 3.55\u00b10.55 x 106 cells/mm3 respectively) compared to control (7.34\u00b10.40) at P&lt;0.05. Also, significant decreases (P&lt;0.05) in the level of the total WBC (White Blood Cell) count, platelet count, PCV (Packed Cell Volume) and Hb (haemoglobin) concentration were observed. The decreases were dose dependent. The MCH (Mean Corpuscular Haemoglobin) and MCHC (Mean Corpuscular Haemoglobin Concentration) except MCV (Mean Corpuscular Volume) significantly decreased in treated group only. The triherbal formulation exhibited significant antioxidant activities showing increased levels of SOD, CAT and Protein content due to activation of the enzyme involve in detoxification of free radicals and decreased in the level of GSH and MDA due to accumulation of peroxides and H2O2. Also, decreased in haematological parameters due to the presence of phytochemicals such as phenol, resins, saponins, sterols, tannis and terpenes in the triherbal formula. Therefore, it has potential to induce haematotoxicity hence consumption of high concentrations should be discouraged.","Cardiovascular disorder is one of the causes of death globally. Quite a number of medicinal plants have been demonstrated to possess and exhibit beneficial effects on cardiovascular system throuhg their antioxidant properties. The study investigated the in vivo antioxidant properties of aqueous C. albidium pulp extract on isoproterenol-induced cardiotoxicity in albino rats. Cardiotoxicity was induced in rats by subcutaneous injection of ISO (85 mg/kg bwt) into adult albino rats and treated with the extract (100 and 200 mg/kg bwt). The levels of nitrite, lipid peroxidation, reduced glutathione total protein and activities of glutathione peroxidase, catalase and superoxide dismutase were evaluated using standard methods. The concentration of total protein was also determined. Administration of ISO (85 mg/kg body weight) caused significant (p &lt; 0.05) reduction in the antioxidant status of animals. The enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants perturbed by the administration of ISO were restored in the C. albidium treated rats. The study concludes that the aqueous extract of C. albidum pulp protected against Isoproterenol-induced cardiotoxicity in adult male Albino rats.","Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an essential component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC). Decreased skeletal muscle CoQ10 content may result in decreased ETC activity and energy production. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that prolonged supplementation with oral CoQ10 will increase plasma CoQ10 concentrations and skeletal muscle CoQ10 content in young, healthy untrained Thoroughbreds. Nineteen Thoroughbreds (27.5\u00b19.7 months old; 11 males, 8 females) from one farm and maintained on a grass pasture with one grain meal per day were supplemented orally once per day for 9 weeks with 1.5 mg/kg body weight of a CoQ10-\u03b2-cyclodextrin inclusion complex. Whole-blood and skeletal muscle biopsies were collected before (T0) and after (T1) 9 weeks of supplementation. Plasma CoQ10 concentrations were determined via high-performance liquid chromatography. Skeletal muscle mitochondrial ETC combined complex I+III enzyme activity (an indirect measurement of CoQ10 content) was assessed spectrophotometrically and normalised to mitochondrial abundance. Results were analysed using a paired two-tailed Students t-test with P\u22640.05 significant. Horses accepted supplementation with no adverse effects. The mean change in plasma CoQ10 concentration from T0 to T1 was significantly greater than zero (0.13\u00b10.02 vs. 0.25\u00b10.03 \u00b5g/ml, mean difference 0.12\u00b10.03; P=0.004), although variability in absorbance resulted in only a 58% response rate. The mean change in skeletal muscle complex I+III activity from T0 to T1 was significantly greater than zero (0.36\u00b10.04 vs. 0.59\u00b10.05 pmol/min/mg of muscle, mean difference 0.23\u00b10.05; P=0.0004), although T1 values for 3/19 horses decreased on average by 23% below T0 values. In conclusion, prolonged oral supplementation of the diet of young, healthy untrained Thoroughbreds with CoQ10 increased mean plasma CoQ10 concentration by 99% and mean skeletal muscle complex I+III activity by 65% with variability in absorbance among horses. Additional research is warranted investigating training and exercise effects on skeletal muscle CoQ10 content in CoQ10 supplemented and un-supplemented Thoroughbreds.","Objective The present study aimed to investigate the ameliorative effect of melittin, a major polypeptide in the venom of honeybee (Apis mellifera) on isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RIF) induced hepatotoxicity in male albino rats. Method: The rats (140-200g) were divided into five groups (n=6): normal control (NC); toxic (T) group treated with INH+RIF (100 mg/kg, p.o.); melittin-treated (Mel15, Mel30) group (15 or 30 \u00b5g/kg s.c); and normal recovery (NR) group. Blood and liver samples were collected for biochemical, hematological and histopathological studies respectively.","Response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to study the optimum condition of mango seed kernel oil (MSKO) extraction with n-hexane. In the present paper, for the first time, we provide an optimal condition of MSKO extraction to obtain the maximum of yield, total phenolic content (TPC) and vitamin E. The experiment was conducted using central composite design (CCD) consisted of twenty experimental points including six replicates of center points to study the effect of three independent variables: temperature, time and amount of n-hexane on dependent variables. Data were analyzed using Design-Expert 10 software. The result showed that the optimum condition of MSKO extraction were 54.19 degC, 5.24 h and 224.23 mL of n-hexane. In this condition MSKO have yield of 7.03%, TPC of 67.77 mg GAE/g oil and vitamin E of 141.22 mg/L. These results suggest that MSKO has potential as raw materials of food products oil-based and as a natural antioxidant of functional food and for use in food processing.La methodologie Response surface methodology (RSM) a ete appliquee pour definir les conditions optimales d'extraction de l'huile de noyau de mangue avec du n-hexane.

Resistance to intensive chemotherapy is common, and targets for molecular therapies are largely undefined. We have now found that the majority of childhood solid tumors, including rhabdoid tumors, neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma and Ewing sarcoma, express an active DNA transposase PGBD5 that can promote site-specific genomic rearrangements in human cells. Using functional genetic approaches, we found that mouse and human cells deficient in non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA repair cannot tolerate the expression of PGBD5. In a chemical screen of DNA damage signaling inhibitors, we identified AZD6738 as a specific sensitizer of PGBD5-dependent DNA damage and apoptosis. We found that expression of PGBD5, but not its nuclease activity-deficient mutant, was sufficient to induce hypersensitivity to AZD6738. Depletion of endogenous PGBD5 conferred resistance to AZD6738 in human tumor cells. PGBD5-expressing tumor cells accumulated unrepaired DNA damage in response to AZD6738 treatment, and underwent apoptosis in both dividing and G1 phase cells in the absence of immediate DNA replication stress. Accordingly, AZD6738 exhibited nanomolar potency against the majority of neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma, Ewing sarcoma and rhabdoid tumor cells tested, while sparing non-transformed human and mouse embryonic fibroblasts in vitro. Finally, treatment with AZD6738 induced apoptosis and regression of human neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma tumors engrafted in immunodeficient mice in vivo. This effect was potentiated by combined treatment with cisplatin, including significant anti-tumor activity against patient-derived primary neuroblastoma xenografts. These findings delineate a therapeutically actionable synthetic dependency induced in PGBD5-expressing solid tumors.","The aim of this study was to analyze, on beef lipids and FA and on beef colour, the impact of extruded linseed (rich in n-3 PUFA) given alone or with rapeseed (rich in n-3 and n-6 PUFA and in 18:1 n-9) in association or not with antioxidants given to Normand (fat breed) cull cows during the finishing period. Dietary linseeds significantly increased proportions of 18:3 n-3 (+56 and +36 % respectively), total trans 18:1 (+66 and +105 %); and of 9cis, 11trans 18:2 (CLA) (+50 and +41 %) in LT muscle of which 18:3 n-3 and CLA are known to be beneficial for the human health. Addition of antioxidants (vitamin E plus plant extracts rich in polyphenols, PERP) reinforced the stimulating effect of lipid supplements on proportions of the three considered FA (18:3 n-3, total trans 18:1, 9cis, 11trans 18:2) in total lipids of both muscles. Dietary n-3 PUFA reduced the resistance capacity of plasma against lipoperoxidation (-11 %) favouring peroxidized products formations such as conjugated dienes (x1.75) and malonedialdehyde (MDA, x2). Intensity of beef lipoperoxidation (estimated by MDA level) tended to be higher in meats packaged under modified atmosphere rich in oxygen (70 %) in the linseed group (2.96 mg/g of tissue) compared to that of the control group (2.19 mg/g of tissue, P = 0.1). Dietary vitamin E provided with PERP effectively protected beef against lipoperoxidation, even in beef packagings with O2. Beef under air packaging from cows given the linseed supplement had a higher redness value than that from control cows. In the case of animals given lipid supplemented diets and submitted to an emotional stress, beef packaged under air or modified atmosphere rich in O2 had a lower redness than that of the same animals given lipids associated to antioxidant supplements. We concluded that the dietary strategy combining addition of n-3 PUFA and of the antioxidant mixture in diets would avoid major risks of lipoperoxidation and alteration of colour in beef products whatever: 1) the conditions of meat ageing and packaging (especially those with contact with oxygen); 2) the degree of emotional stress of animals just prior slaughter.","The relation between health and nutrition has been popular at last year. So consumers select functional foods which are healthier than the others. Especially meat and meat products has negative perception on people due to they cause to increase in risk of canser and high colesterol. At this rewiev, studies about doing healthy and functional meat and meat products were investigated. For developing nutrition quality and functionality of raw meat vitamine E, vitamine C and selenyum are added to animal nutrition. With addition of several functional ingredients to product during process, meat products can be better in terms of sensory, textural and functionality.","Endometriosis is a common complex inflammatory condition characterised by the presence of endometrium-like tissue outside the uterus, mainly in the pelvic area. It is associated with chronic pelvic pain and infertility, and its pathogenesis remains poorly understood. The disease is typically classified according to the revised American Fertility Society (rAFS) 4-stage surgical assessment system, although stage does not correlate well with symptomatology or prognosis. Previously identified genetic variants mainly are associated with stage III/IV disease, highlighting the need for further phenotype-stratified analysis that requires larger datasets. We conducted a meta-analysis of 15 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and a replication analysis, including 58,115 cases and 733,480 controls in total, and sub-phenotype analyses of stage I/II, stage III/IV and infertility-associated endometriosis cases. This revealed 27 genetic loci associated with endometriosis at the genome-wide p-value threshold (P&lt;5\u00d710\u22128), 13 of which are novel and an additional 8 novel genes identified from gene-based association analyses. Of the 27 loci, 21 (78%) had greater effect sizes in stage III/IV disease compared to stage I/II, 1 (4%) had greater effect size in stage I/II compared to stage III/IV and 17 (63%) had greater effect sizes when restricted to infertility-associated endometriosis cases compared to overall endometriosis. These results suggest that specific variants may confer risk for different sub-types of endometriosis through distinct pathways. Analyses of genetic variants underlying different pain symptoms reported in the UK Biobank showed that 7/9 had positive significant (p&lt;1.28\u00d7103) positive genetic correlations with endometriosis, suggesting a genetic basis for sensitivity to pain in general. Additional conditions with significant positive genetic correlations with endometriosis included uterine fibroids, excessive and irregular menstrual bleeding, osteoarthritis, diabetes as well as menstrual cycle length and age at menarche. These results provide a basis for fine-mapping of the causal variants at these 27 loci, and for functional follow-up to understand their contribution to endometriosis and its potential subtypes.","L-DOPA Induced Dyskinesia (LID) is associated with prolonged L-DOPA therapy. Vitamin-D receptor modulation improves motor-cognitive deficit in experimental LID Parkinsonism. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the mechanism underlying the anti-dyskinetic potential of Vitamin D3 (VD3). Dyskinesia was induced by chronic L-DOPA administration in 6-OHDA lesioned male C57BL6 mice. The experimental groups (Dyskinesia, Dyskinesia/VD3, and Dyskinesia/Amantadine) and controls were challenged with L-DOPA to determine the abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) score during 14 days of VD3 (30 mg/kg) or Amantadine (40 mg/kg) treatment. Global behavioral Axial, Limb &amp; Orolingual (ALO) AIMs were scored for 1 min at every 20 mins interval, over a duration of 100 mins on days 1,3,7,11 and 14 of treatment. Thereafter, brain samples were collected and processed for immunoblotting to assess striatal expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), monoamine oxidase (MAO), cathecol-o-methyl transferase (COMT), dopamine decarboxylase (DDC), CD11b, BAX, P47phox, and IL-1\u03b2. VD3 significantly attenuated ALO AIMs only on days 11 &amp; 14, with maximal reduction of 32.7% compared with dyskinetic mice but had no effect on days 1, 3 &amp; 7, while amantadine decreased AIMs all through days 1 to 14 with maximal reduction of 64.5%. TH and MAO-B expression were not significantly different across the groups. DDC was significantly suppressed in dyskinetic mice vs control (p&lt;0.001) but remained unchanged in VD3 mice vs dyskinetic mice. COMT was upregulated in the dyskinetic group vs control (p&lt;0.01) and attenuated in VD3 mice (p&lt;0.05) compared to the dyskinetic group. Interestingly, VD3 inhibited significantly (p&lt;0.01) oxidative stress (p47phox), apoptosis (BAX), inflammation (IL-1\u03b2), and microglial activation (CD11b) in dyskinetic mice. Overall, we find that the anti-dyskinetic effects of VD3 is associated with modulation of striatal oxidative stress, microglial responses, inflammation, and apoptotic signaling.","Background: Busulfan is a chemotherapy medicine for treatment of cancer. This medicine has cytotoxic effects on different organs of animal. Since the use of chemotherapy medicine are increasing due to individuals get involved to cancer, thus preserving of  reproductive system in these patients is essential to continue fertility. Materials and Method: In present study the testis of mice  were  injected with different doses of busulfan (35, 40 mg/kg body weight intraperitonealy. The effects of busulfan was examinned on destruction of testis tissue, semen parameters and catalase enzymatic activity compared with control group after 30 days. Finally, fter determining the effective dose of busulfan, Vitamin E was injected to the mice as an antioxidant enzyme  and its effects on semen parameters and testis tissue was examined after one month.  Results: The results showed that oxidative stress was increased in busulfan-treated mice during 30 days. Catalase enzymatic activity decreased significantly in testis of Busulfan-treated mice in comparison with control group. A significant decrease of sperm number was observed according to treatment by Busulfan. After finding the most damaging dose of busulfan (40 mg/kg ) in destruction of testis tissue, these mice were injected by vitamine E. The results showed that the oxidative stress and percentage of abnormal sperm were decreased in Busulfan-treated mice that exposed a dose of 100 mg/kg vitamin E. The number of sperm and antioxidant activity of catalase was increased. Conclusion: Vitamin E improves a revival of spermatogenesis and improves testicular parameters in these patients.","Salinity limits the growth and yield of many crops across the globe and is considered as major threat to agriculture. Acacia auriculiformis, an important salt tolerant crop, is growing abundantly in the salt-affected mangrove areas of Sunderban, West Bengal, India. In the present study, we have reported the physiological, molecular and antioxidant response of this crop to a gradient of salt treatments ranging between 0 and 800 mM NaCl. As a stress response, the antioxidant enzymes viz. superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and guaiacol peroxidase (GPX) were highly activated at 200, 400 and 800 mM NaCl respectively. Antioxidant metabolites such as phenols and thiols elevated with increasing salt treatments thus augmenting antioxidant activity with significant positive relationship with phenol content. Similarly, phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) activity was up-regulated in a dose dependent manner with significant relationship with phenol content. This study also reported the phenolic profile for the first time in A. auriculiformis with the abundance of flavonoids. In addition, transcriptional up-regulation of Na+/H+ antiporter gene (NHX1) and the development of robust vascular tissues was noticed at 400 mM NaCl stress compared to control, while further stress at 800 mM NaCl induced poor vascular tissue growth but with higher PAL activity and consequent higher phenol content. Based on this observation, a model for salt tolerance mechanism of A. auriculiformis has been proposed."],"title":["Drug repurposing for mitochondrial diseases using a pharmacological model of complex

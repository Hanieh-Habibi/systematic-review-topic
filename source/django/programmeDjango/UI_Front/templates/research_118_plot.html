However, longterm PD is associated with significant pathology, negating the positive effects over haemodialysis. Importantly, peritonitis and activation of macrophages is closely associated with disease progression and treatment failure. However, recent advances in macrophage biology suggest opposite functions for macrophages of different cellular origins. While monocyte-derived macrophages promote disease progression in some models of fibrosis, tissue resident macrophages have rather been associated with protective roles. Thus, we aimed to identify the relative contribution of tissue resident macrophages to PD induced inflammation in mice. Unexpectedly, we found an incremental loss of homeostatic characteristics, anti-inflammatory and efferocytic functionality in peritoneal resident macrophages, accompanied by enhanced inflammatory responses to external stimuli. Moreover, presence of glucose degradation products within the dialysis fluid led to markedly enhanced inflammation and almost complete disappearance of tissue resident cells. Thus, alterations in tissue resident macrophages may render longterm PD patients sensitive to developing peritonitis and consequently fibrosis/sclerosis.","A mosaic of cross-phyla chemical interactions occurs between all metazoans and their microbiomes. In humans, the gut harbors the heaviest microbial load, but many organs, particularly those with a mucosal surface, associate with highly adapted and evolved microbial consortia1. The microbial residents within these organ systems are increasingly well characterized, yielding a good understanding of human microbiome composition, but we have yet to elucidate the full chemical impact the microbiome exerts on an animal and the breadth of the chemical diversity it contributes2. A number of molecular families are known to be shaped by the microbiome including short-chain fatty acids, indoles, aromatic amino acid metabolites, complex polysaccharides, and host lipids; such as sphingolipids and bile acids3\u201311. These metabolites profoundly affect host physiology and are being explored for their roles in both health and disease. Considering the diversity of the human microbiome, numbering over 40,000 operational taxonomic units12, a plethora of molecular diversity remains to be discovered. Here, we use unique mass spectrometry informatics approaches and data mapping onto a murine 3D-model13\u201315 to provide an untargeted assessment of the chemical diversity between germ-free (GF) and colonized mice (specific-pathogen free, SPF), and report the finding of novel bile acids produced by the microbiome in both mice and humans that have evaded characterization despite 170 years of research on bile acid chemistry16.","Human \u03b2-defensin 3 (HBD3), is an anti-microbial host-defence peptide, that can rapidly enter macrophages to modulate TLR4 responses to lipopolysaccharide. However, the molecular mechanisms by which HBD3 exerts this anti-inflammatory influence remain unclear. Here, we show mice deleted for the orthologue of HBD3 have an increased acute lipopolysaccharide response in vivo. Furthermore, we found that HBD3 limited the response of macrophages to classical activation, and contemporaneously drove expression of IL-4. An increase in markers of alternative activation, and a change in metabolic flux was also observed. Consistent with these results, HBD3 enhanced the IL-4 mediated polarisation of na\u00efve macrophages. Finally, we demonstrate that the ability of HBD3 to limit macrophage classical activation requires IL-4R\u03b1. These data reveal a previously unrecognised role for HBD3 in influencing the polarisation state of macrophages to enable a state conducive for repair and resolution.","Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is a bone-derived hormone that binds to binary FGFR/\u03b1-Klotho receptor complexes in the kidney tubules to inhibit phosphate reabsorption and 1,25(OH)2D production. Excess FGF23 causes X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) and tumor induced osteomalacia (TIO). Recently, Burosumab, an FGF23 blocking antibody, was approved for treating these hypophosphatemic disorders. A small molecule inhibitor that specifically binds to FGF23 to prevent activation of FGFR/\u03b1-Klotho complexes has potential advantages over a systemically administered FGF23 blocking antibody. We previously identified the small molecule ZINC13407541 (N-[[2-(2-phenylethenyl)cyclopenten-1-yl]methylidene]hydroxylamine) as a therapeutic lead FGF23 antagonist. Additional structure-activity studies developed a series of ZINC13407541 analogues with enhanced drug-like properties. In this study, we tested in a pre-clinical Hyp mouse homologue of XLH a direct connect analogue (8n) [(E)-2-(4-(tert-butyl)phenyl)cyclopent-1-ene-1-carbaldehyde oxime] that exhibited the greatest stability in microsomal assays, and 13a [(E)-2-((E)-4-methylstyryl)benzaldehyde oxime] that exhibited increased in vitro potency. We found that pharmacological inhibition of FGF23 with either of these compounds blocked FGF23 signaling and significantly increased serum phosphate and 1,25(OH)2D concentrations in Hyp mice. Long-term parenteral treatment with 8n or 13a also enhanced linear bone growth, increased mineralization of bone, and narrowed the growth plate in Hyp mice. The more potent 13a compound showed greater therapeutic efficacy in Hyp mice. Further optimization of these FGF23 inhibitors may lead to versatile drugs to treat FGF23-mediated disorders.","Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are involved in development of diabetes. However, the impact of excessive glucose on CTL-mediated antigen-independent killing remains elusive. Here, we report that TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) is substantially up- regulated in CTLs in environments with high glucose (HG) both in vitro and in vivo. The PI3K- Akt-NF\u03baB axis and non-mitochondrial reactive oxygen species are essential in HG-induced TRAIL upregulation in CTLs. TRAILhigh CTLs induce apoptosis of pancreatic beta cell line 1.4E7. Metformin and Vitamin D synergistically reduce HG-enhanced expression of TRAIL in CTLs and coherently protect 1.4E7 cells from TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Notably, in patients with diabetes, correlation between Vitamin D concentrations in plasma and glucose levels is linked to HG-enhanced TRAIL expression on CTLs. Microarray data reveal that OXCT2, an important enzyme in ketone body catabolism, is a promising target in response to vitamin D. Our work not only reveals a novel mechanism of CTL involvement in progression of diabetes, but also establishes CTLs as a target for combined metformin and vitamin D therapy to protect pancreatic beta cells of diabetic patients.","Background Invasive lobular breast carcinoma (ILC), the second most prevalent histological subtype of breast cancer, exhibits unique molecular features compared with the more common invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). While genomic and transcriptomic features of ILC and IDC have been characterized, genome-wide chromatin accessibility pattern differences between ILC and IDC remain largely unexplored.","Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) pathology progresses gradually via anatomically connected brain regions. Earlier studies have shown that amyloid-\u03b21-42 oligomers (oA\u03b2) can be directly transferred between connected neurons. However, the mechanism of transfer is not fully revealed. We observed formation of oA\u03b2 induced tunneling nanotubes (TNTs), nanoscaled f-actin containing membrane conduit, in differentially differentiated SH-SY5Y neuronal models. Time-lapse images showed that TNTs propagate oligomers from one cell to another. Preceding the TNT-formation, we detected oA\u03b2 induced plasma membrane (PM) damage and calcium-dependent repair through lysosomal-exocytosis and significant membrane surface expansion, followed by massive endocytosis to re-establish the PM. Massive endocytosis was monitored by an influx of the membrane-impermeable dye TMA-DPH and PM damage was quantified by propidium iodide influx in the absence of calcium. The massive endocytosis eventually caused accumulation of internalized oA\u03b2 in Lamp1 positive multi vesicular bodies/lysosomes via the actin cytoskeleton remodulating p21-activated kinase1 (PAK1) dependent endocytic pathway. Three dimensional quantitative and qualitative confocal imaging, structured illumination superresolution microscopy (SIM) and flowcytometry data revealed that oA\u03b2 induces activated phospho-PAK1, which modulates the formation of long stretched f-actin extensions between cells. Moreover, formation of TNTs can be inhibited by preventing PAK1 dependent internalization of oA\u03b2 using small-molecule inhibitor IPA-3, a highly selective cell permeable auto-regulatory inhibitor of PAK1. The present study gives insight that the TNTs are probably instigated as a consequence of oA\u03b2 induced PM damage and repair process, followed by PAK1 dependent endocytosis and actin remodeling, probably to maintain cell surface expansion and/or membrane tension in equilibrium.","Background Rheumatoid arthritis is a common autoimmune disorder influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Epigenome-wide association studies can identify environmentally mediated epigenetic changes such as altered DNA methylation, which may also be influenced by genetic factors. To investigate possible contributions of DNA methylation to the aetiology of rheumatoid arthritis with minimum confounding genetic heterogeneity, we investigated genome-wide DNA methylation in disease discordant monozygotic twin pairs.","Previous studies have shown the effects of vitamins on the development of the mammary gland. However, the role of niacin in this process has not been reported. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of niacin on mammary gland development in pubertal mice and to use a mouse mammary epithelial cell line to study the underlying mechanism. The results showed that niacin could activate the AKT/mTOR and ERK signaling pathways by the Gi protein-coupled receptor and increase phosphorylation of 4EBP1 to promote the synthesis of cell proliferation markers, leading to the dissociation of the Rb-E2F1 complex in mMECs. In addition, 0.5% niacin promoted mammary duct development, increased the expression of cyclin D1/D3 and PCNA, and activated Akt/mTOR and ERK1/2 in the mammary glands of pubertal mice. These results strongly suggest that niacin stimulates mammary gland development in pubertal mice through the Akt/mTOR and ERK1/2 signaling pathways and that the Gi protein-coupled receptor is essential for this function.","As a reliable and high-throughput proteomics strategy, data-independent acquisition (DIA) has shown great potential for protein analysis. However, DIA also imposes stress on the data processing algorithm by generating complex multiplexed spectra. Traditionally, DIA data is processed using spectral libraries refined from experiment histories, which requires stable experiment conditions and additional runs. Furthermore, scientists still need to use library-free tools to generate spectral libraries from additional runs. To lessen those burdens, here we present DIAFree(https://github.com/xuesu/DIAFree), a library-free, tag-index-based software suite that enables both restrict search and open search on DIA data using the information of MS1 scans in a precursor-centric and spectrum-centric style. We validate the quality of detection by publicly available data. We further evaluate the quality of spectral libraries produced by DIAFree.","The mammalian neocortex develops from a single layer of neuroepithelial cells to form a six-layer heterogeneous mosaic of differentiated neurons and glial cells. This process requires a complex choreography of temporally and spatially restricted transcription factors and epigenetic regulators. Even subtle disruptions in this regulation can alter the way the neocortex forms and functions, leading to a neurodevelopmental disorder. One epigenetic regulator that is essential for the precise development of the neocortex is CITED2 (CBP/p300 Interacting Transactivator with ED-rich termini). Cited2 is highly expressed by intermediate progenitor cells in the subventricular zone during the generation of the superficial layers of the neocortex. A forebrain-specific conditional knockout of Cited2 (cKO) exhibits reduced proliferation of intermediate progenitor cells embryonically, leading to reduced thickness of the superficial layers and a specific reduction in the somatosensory neocortical length postnatally. Further, the Cited2 cKO displays decreased corpus callosum volume and dysregulation of precise neuronal connectivity within the somatosensory cortex. Here, we explore the behavioral consequences resulting from this aberrant neocortical development. We demonstrate that Cited2 cKO mice display decreased maternal separation-induced ultrasonic vocalizations as neonates, and an increase in the repetitive behavior of rearing and lack of habituation following repeated acoustic startle as adults. They do not display alterations in anxiety-like behavior, overall locomotor activity or social interactions. Together with the morphological, molecular, and connectivity disruptions, these results identify the Cited2 cKO neocortex as an ideal system to study mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental and neuroanatomical disruptions with relevance to human neurodevelopmental disorders.","Dysbiosis of gut microbiota is associated with many pathologies, yet host factors modulating microbiota remain unclear. Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS or \u201cIC\u201d) is a debilitating condition of chronic pelvic pain often with co-morbid urinary dysfunction and anxiety/depression, and recent studies find fecal dysbiosis in IC/BPS patients. We previously identified the locus encoding acyloxyacyl hydrolase, Aoah, as a modulator of pelvic pain severity in a murine IC/BPS model. AOAH-deficient mice spontaneously develop rodent correlates of pelvic pain, increased responses to induced pelvic pain models, voiding dysfunction, and anxious/depressive behaviors. Here, we report that AOAH-deficient mice exhibit dysbiosis of GI microbiota. AOAH-deficient mice exhibit an enlarged cecum, a phenotype long associated with germ-free rodents, and reduced trans-epithelial electrical resistance consistent with a \u201cleaky gut\u201d phenotype. AOAH-deficient ceca showed altered gene expression consistent with inflammation, Wnt signaling, and urologic disease. 16S rRNA sequencing of stool revealed altered microbiota in AOAH-deficient mice, and GC-MS identified altered metabolomes. Co-housing AOAH-deficient mice with wild type mice resulted in converged microbiota and altered predicted metagenomes. Co-housing also abrogated the pelvic pain phenotype of AOAH-deficient mice, which was corroborated by oral gavage of AOAH-deficient mice with stool slurry of wild type mice. Converged microbiota also alleviated comorbid anxiety-like behavior in AOAH-deficient mice. Oral gavage of AOAH-deficient mice with anaerobes cultured from IC/BPS stool resulted in exacerbation of pelvic allodynia. Together, these data indicate that AOAH is a host determinant of normal gut microbiota, and the dysbiosis associated with AOAH deficiency contributes to pelvic pain. These findings suggest that the gut microbiome is a potential therapeutic target for IC/BPS.","Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex inflammatory disease mediated by autoreactive antibodies that damages multiple tissues in children and adults. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have statistically implicated hundreds of loci in the susceptibility to human disease, including SLE, but the majority have failed to identify the causal variants or the effector genes. As a physicochemical approach to detecting functional variants and connecting them to target genes, we generated comprehensive, high-resolution maps of SLE variant accessibility and gene connectivity in the context of the three-dimensional chromosomal architecture of human tonsillar follicular helper T cells (TFH), a cell type required for the production of anti-nuclear antibodies characteristic of SLE. These spatial epigenomic maps identified a shortlist of over 400 potentially functional variants across 48 GWAS-implicated SLE loci. Twenty percent of these variants were located in open promoters of highly-expressed TFH genes, while 80% reside in non-promoter genomic regions that are connected in 3D to genes that likewise tend to be highly expressed in TFH. Importantly, we find that 90% of SLE-associated variants exhibit spatial proximity to genes that are not nearby in the 1D sequence of the genome, and over 60% of variants \u2018skip\u2019 the nearest gene to physically interact only with the promoters of distant genes. Gene ontology confirmed that genes in spatial proximity to SLE variants reside in highly SLE-relevant networks, including accessible variants that loop 200-1000 kb to interact with the promoters of the canonical TFH genes BCL6 and CXCR5. CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing confirmed that these variants reside in novel, distal regulatory elements required for normal BCL6 and CXCR5 expression by T cells. Furthermore, SLE-associated SNP-promoter interactomes implicated a set of novel genes with no known role in TFH or SLE disease biology, including the homeobox-interacting protein kinase HIPK1 and the Ste kinase homolog MINK1. Targeting these kinases in primary human TFH cells inhibited production of IL-21, a requisite cytokine for production of class-switched antibodies by B cells. This 3D-variant-to-gene mapping approach gives mechanistic insight into the SLE-associated regulatory architecture of the human genome.","IMPORTANCE Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is the leading cause of disability in the elderly. It has been a long time about the calcium hypothesis of AD on the basis of emerging evidence since 1994. However, most studies focused on the association between calcium homeostasis and AD, and concerned the intracellular calcium concentration. Only few studies reported reduced serum calcium levels in AD. Until now, it remains unclear whether serum calcium levels are genetically associated with AD risk.","Species showing repeated evolution of similar traits can help illuminate the molecular and developmental basis of diverging traits and specific adaptations. Following the last glacial period, dwarfism and specialized bottom feeding morphology evolved rapidly in several landlocked Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) populations in Iceland. To initiate study of the genetic divergence between small benthic morphs and larger morphs with limnetic morphotype, we conducted an RNA-seq transcriptome analysis of developing charr. We sequenced mRNA from whole embryos at four stages in early development of two stocks with contrasting morphologies, the small benthic (SB) charr from Lake Thingvallavatn and Holar aquaculture (AC) charr.","Satellite glia are the major glial type found in ganglia of the peripheral nervous system and wrap around cell bodies of sympathetic and sensory neurons that are very diverse. Other than their close physical association with peripheral neurons, little is known about this glial population. Here, we performed single cell RNA sequencing analysis and identified five different populations of satellite glia from sympathetic and sensory ganglia. We identified three shared populations of satellite glia enriched in immune-response genes, immediate-early genes and ion channels/ECM-interactors, respectively. Sensory- and sympathetic-specific satellite glia are differentially enriched for modulators of lipid synthesis and metabolism. Sensory glia are also specifically enriched for genes involved in glutamate turnover. Further, satellite glia and Schwann cells can be distinguished by unique transcriptional signatures. This study reveals remarkable heterogeneity of satellite glia in the peripheral nervous system.","The microbiota play critical roles in regulating the function and health of intestine and extraintestinal organs. A fundamental question is whether there is an intestinal-microbiome-breast axis during the development of breast cancer. If yes, what are the roles of host factors? Vitamin D receptor (VDR) involves host factors and the human microbiome. Vdr gene variation shapes the human microbiome and VDR deficiency leads to dysbiosis. We hypothesized that intestinal VDR protects hosts against tumorigenesis in breast. Reduced VDR mRNA expression was observed in patients with breast cancer. We used a 7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA)-induced breast cancer model in intestinal epithelial VDR knockout (VDR\u0394IEC) mice. We reported that VDR\u0394IEC mice with dysbiosis are more susceptible to breast cancer induced by DMBA. Intestinal and breast microbiota analysis showed that lacking VDR leads to bacterial profile shift from normal to susceptible carcinogenesis.  We found enhanced bacterial staining within breast tumors. At the molecular and cellular levels, we identified the mechanisms by which intestinal epithelial VDR deficiency led to increased gut permeability, disrupted tight junctions, microbial translocation, and enhanced inflammation, thus increasing the tumor size and number in breast. Furthermore, treatment with beneficial bacterial metabolite butyrate or probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum reduced the breast tumors, enhanced the tight junctions, and inhibited inflammation in the VDR\u0394IEC mice. Gut microbiome contribute to the pathogenesis of diseases, not only in the intestine, but also in the breast. Our study provides new insights into the mechanism by which intestinal VDR dysfunction and gut dysbiosis led to high risk of extraintestinal tumorigenesis. Gut-tumor-microbiome interactions indicate a new target in the prevention and treatment of breast cancer.","Vitamin D3 (vitD3) and its active metabolite, calcitriol (1,25-(OH)2D3), affect multiple tissue types by interacting with the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Although vitD3 deficiency has been correlated with increased incidence of breast cancer and less favorable outcomes across ethnic groups and latitudes, randomized human clinical trials have yet to provide conclusive evidence on the efficacy of vitD3 in treating and/or preventing breast cancer. When considering that carcinogenesis is \u201cdevelopment gone awry\u201d, it becomes imperative to understand the role of vitD3 during breast development. Mammary gland development in VDR KO mice is altered by increased ductal elongation and lateral branching during puberty, precocious and increased alveologenesis at pregnancy and delayed post-lactational involution. These developmental processes are largely influenced by mammotropic hormones, i.e., ductal elongation by estrogen, branching by progesterone and alveologenesis by prolactin. However, research on vitD3\u2019s effects on mammary gland morphogenesis focused on cell proliferation and apoptosis in 2D culture models and utilized supra-physiological doses of vitD3, conditions that spare the microenvironment in which morphogenesis takes place. Here, using two 3D culture models, we investigated the role of vitD3 in mammary epithelial morphogenesis. We found that vitD3 interferes with estrogen\u2019s actions on T47D human breast cancer cells in 3D differently at different doses, and recapitulates what is observed in vivo. Also, vitD3 can act autonomously and affect the organization of MCF10A cells in 3D collagen matrix by influencing collagen fiber organization. Thus, we uncovered how vitD3 modulates mammary tissue organization independent of its already known effects on cell proliferation.","Despite significant recent advances in precision medicine1,2, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains near-uniformly lethal. While the most frequent genomic alterations in PDAC are not presently druggable3 and conventional therapies are often ineffective in this disease4, immune-modulatory therapies hold promise to meaningfully improve outcomes for PDAC patients. Development of such therapies requires an improved understanding of the immune evasion mechanisms that characterize the PDAC microenvironment, including frequent exclusion of antineoplastic T cells and abundance of immune-suppressive myeloid cells5\u20139. Here we show that cancer cell-intrinsic glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 2 (GOT2) shapes the immune microenvironment to suppress antitumor immunity. Mechanistically, we find that GOT2 functions beyond its established role in the malate-aspartate shuttle10\u201313 and promotes the transcriptional activity of nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPAR\u03b4), facilitated by direct fatty acid binding. While GOT2 in PDAC cells is dispensable for cancer cell proliferation in vivo, GOT2 loss results in T cell-dependent suppression of tumor growth, and genetic or pharmacologic activation of PPAR\u03b4 restores PDAC progression in the GOT2-null context. This cancer cell-intrinsic GOT2-PPAR\u03b4 axis promotes spatial restriction of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from the tumor microenvironment, and fosters the immune-suppressive phenotype of tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells. Our results demonstrate a non-canonical function for an established mitochondrial enzyme in transcriptional regulation of immune evasion, which may be exploitable to promote a productive antitumor immune response.","Summary: We present a tool, diCal-IBD, for detecting identity-by-descent (IBD) tracts between pairs of genomic sequences. Our method builds on a recent demographic inference method based on the coalescent with recombination, and is able to incorporate demographic information as a prior. Simulation study shows that diCal-IBD has significantly higher recall and precision than that of existing IBD detection methods, while retaining reasonable accuracy for IBD tracts as small as 0.1 cM.","Induction of intestinal drug metabolizing enzymes can complicate the development of new drugs, owing to potential to cause drug-drug interactions (DDIs) leading to changes in pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy. The development of a human relevant model of the adult intestine that accurately predicts CYP450 induction could help address this challenge as species differences preclude extrapolation from animals. Here, we combined organoids and Organ-Chip technology to create a human Duodenum Intestine-Chip that emulates intestinal tissue architecture and functions, that are relevant for the study of drug transport, metabolism, and DDI. Duodenum Intestine-Chip demonstrates the polarized cell architecture, intestinal barrier function, presence of specialized cell subpopulations, and in vivo-relevant expression, localization, and function of major intestinal drug transporters. Notably, in comparison to Caco-2, it displays improved CYP3A4 expression and induction capability. This model could enable improved in vitro to in vivo extrapolation for better predictions of human pharmacokinetics and risk of DDIs.","Significant increases in sedimentation rate accompany the evolution of multicellularity. These increases should lead to rapid changes in ecological distribution, thereby affecting the costs and benefits of multicellularity and its likelihood to evolve. However, how genetic and cellular traits control this process, their likelihood of emergence over evolutionary timescales, and the variation in these traits as multicellularity evolves, are still poorly understood. Here, using isolates of the ichthyosporean genus Sphaeroforma - close unicellular relatives of animals with brief transient multicellular life stages - we demonstrate that sedimentation rate is a highly variable and evolvable trait affected by at least two distinct physical mechanisms. First, we find extensive (&gt;300x) variation in sedimentation rates for different Sphaeroforma species, mainly driven by size and density during the unicellular-to-multicellular life cycle transition. Second, using experimental evolution with sedimentation rate as a focal trait, we readily obtained, for the first time, fast settling and multicellular S. arctica isolates. Quantitative microscopy showed that increased sedimentation rates most often arose by incomplete cellular separation after cell division, leading to clonal \u201cclumping\u201d multicellular variants with increased size and density. Strikingly, density increases also arose by an acceleration of the nuclear doubling time relative to cell size. Similar size- and density-affecting phenotypes were observed in four additional species from the Sphaeroforma genus, suggesting variation in these traits might be widespread in the marine habitat. By resequencing evolved isolates to high genomic coverage, we identified mutations in regulators of cytokinesis, plasma membrane remodelling, and chromatin condensation that may contribute to both clump formation and the increase in the nuclear number-to-volume ratio. Taken together, this study illustrates how extensive cellular control of density and size drive sedimentation rate variation, likely shaping the onset and further evolution of multicellularity.","Although cellular senescence is increasingly recognized as driving multiple age-related co-morbidities through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), in vivo senescent cell identification, particularly in bulk or single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data remains challenging. Here, we generated a novel gene set (SenMayo) and first validated its enrichment in bone biopsies from two aged human cohorts. SenMayo also identified senescent cells in aged murine brain tissue, demonstrating applicability across tissues and species. For direct validation, we demonstrated significant reductions in SenMayo in bone following genetic clearance of senescent cells in mice, with similar findings in adipose tissue from humans in a pilot study of pharmacological senescent cell clearance. In direct comparisons, SenMayo outperformed all six existing senescence/SASP gene sets in identifying senescent cells across tissues and in demonstrating responses to senescent cell clearance. We next used SenMayo to identify senescent hematopoietic or mesenchymal cells at the single cell level from publicly available human and murine bone marrow/bone scRNA-seq data and identified monocytic and osteolineage cells, respectively, as showing the highest levels of senescence/SASP genes. Using pseudotime and cellular communication patterns, we found senescent hematopoietic and mesenchymal cells communicated with other cells through common pathways, including the Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF) pathway, which has been implicated not only in inflammation but also in immune evasion, an important property of senescent cells. Thus, SenMayo identifies senescent cells across tissues and species with high fidelity. Moreover, using this senescence panel, we were able to characterize senescent cells at the single cell level and identify key intercellular signaling pathways associated with these cells, which may be particularly useful for evolving efforts to map senescent cells (e.g., SenNet). In addition, SenMayo represents a potentially clinically applicable panel for monitoring senescent cell burden with aging and other conditions as well as in studies of senolytic drugs.","While weight-bearing and resistive exercise modestly increases aBMD, the precise relationship between physical activity and bone microstructure, and strain in humans is not known. Previously, we established a voluntary upper-extremity loading model that assigns a person\u2019s target force based on their subject-specific, continuum FE-estimated radius bone strain. Here, our purpose was to quantify the inter-individual variability in radius microstructure and FE-estimated strain explained by site-specific mechanical loading history, and to determine whether variability in strain is captured by aBMD, a clinically relevant measure of bone density and fracture risk. Seventy-two women aged 21-40 were included in this cross-sectional analysis. High resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HRpQCT) was used to measure macro- and micro-structure in the distal radius. Mean energy equivalent strain in the distal radius was calculated from continuum finite element models generated from clinical resolution CT images of the forearm. Areal BMD was used in a nonlinear regression model to predict FE strain. Hierarchical linear regression models were used to assess the predictive capability of intrinsic (age, height) and modifiable (body mass, grip strength, physical activity) predictors. Fifty-one percent of the variability in FE bone strain was explained by its relationship with aBMD, with higher density predicting lower strains. Age and height explained up to 31.6% of the variance in microstructural parameters. Body mass explained 9.1% and 10.0% of the variance in aBMD and bone strain, respectively, with higher body mass indicative of greater density. Overall, results suggest that meaningful differences in bone structure and strain can be predicted by subject characteristics.","Our goal was to elucidate microRNAs (miRNAs) that may repress the excess bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling observed during pathological calcification in the Klotho mouse model of kidney disease. We hypothesized that restoring healthy levels of miRNAs that post-transcriptionally repress osteogenic calcific factors may decrease aortic calcification. Our relative abundance profiles of miRNAs in healthy aorta differ greatly from those in calcified mouse aorta. Many of these miRNAs are predicted to regulate proteins involved in BMP signaling and may control osteogenesis. Two differentially regulated miRNAs, miR-145 and miR-378, were selected based on three criteria: reduced levels in calcified aorta, the ability to target more than one protein in the BMP signaling pathway, and conservation of targeted sequences between humans and mice. Forced expression using a lentiviral vector demonstrated that restoring normal levels repressed the synthesis of BMP2 and other pro-osteogenic proteins and inhibited pathological aortic calcification in Klotho mice with renal insufficiency. This study identified miRNAs that may impact BMP signaling in both sexes and demonstrated the efficacy of selected miRNAs in reducing aortic calcification in vivo. Calcification of the aorta and the aortic valve resulting from abnormal osteogenesis is common in those with kidney disease, diabetes, and high cholesterol. Such vascular osteogenesis is a clinically significant feature. The calcification modulating miRNAs described here are candidates for biomarkers and \u201cmiRNA replacement therapies\u201d in the context of chronic kidney disease and other pro-calcific conditions.","Background The incidence of childhood type 1 diabetes (T1D) incidence is rising in many countries, supposedly because of changing environmental factors, which are yet largely unknown.","Brevibacillus texasporus peptide (BT peptide) is immunomodulatory in poultry as a feed additive to substitute antibiotics. In the present study we performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing to compare development of the cecal microbial communities in Clostridium perfringens-challenged broilers fed basal diet only or with either BT peptide (48 ppm) or antibiotics mixture (20 ppm bacitracin zinc and 40 ppm colistin sulfate). 240 chicks were randomly assigned into each treatment and a total of 65 cecal samples were collected at the beginning, during seven challenge days and one week post challenge. The composition of microbial communities was clearly distinguishable over time. Treatments with challenge and the antibiotics mixture were associated with increased diversity and with higher relative abundances of Alistipes sp. CHKCI003 and Faecalibacterium and lower abundance of Escherichia coli (all p &lt; 0.05). At the termination of the trial, the cecal microbiota in broilers supplemented with BT peptide was dominated by members of Bacteroidaceae. Predicted function analysis reveals significant enrichment of genes involved in ion-coupled transporters and sugar and biotin metabolism in the BT peptide treatment. Taken together, our results suggest that BT peptide and commonly used antibiotics have different influences on modulating the composition of cecal microbiota in broilers.","To identify potential therapeutic stop-gaps for SARS-CoV-2, we evaluated a library of 1,670 approved and reference compounds in an unbiased, cellular image-based screen for their ability to suppress the broad impacts of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on phenomic profiles of human renal cortical epithelial cells using deep learning. In our assay, remdesivir is the only antiviral tested with strong efficacy, neither chloroquine nor hydroxychloroquine have any beneficial effect in this human cell model, and a small number of compounds not currently being pursued clinically for SARS-CoV-2 have efficacy. We observed weak but beneficial class effects of \u03b2-blockers, mTOR/PI3K inhibitors and Vitamin D analogues and a mild amplification of the viral phenotype with \u03b2-agonists.","Disproportionate distal limb shortening is the hallmark of acromelic dysplasias. Among them, geleophysic dysplasia is a rare, frequently lethal condition characterized by severe short stature, musculoskeletal, cardiac, pulmonary, and skin anomalies. Geleophysic dysplasia results from dominant fibrillin-1 (FBN1) or recessive ADAMTSL2 mutations, suggesting a functional link between ADAMTSL2 and FBN1. Mice lacking ADAMTSL2 die at birth, precluding analysis of postnatal skeletal growth and mechanisms underlying the skeletal anomalies of geleophysic dysplasia. We show that Adamtsl2 is expressed in limb soft tissues, predominantly in tendon. Expression in developing bones is limited to their terminal cell layers that are destined to become articular cartilage and is absent in growth plate cartilage. Adamtsl2 conditional deletion in limb mesenchyme using Prxl-Cre led to an acromelic dysplasia, providing a suitable model for investigation of geleophysic dysplasia. Unexpectedly, conditional Adamtsl2 deletion using Scx-Cre, a tendon-specific deleter, also impaired skeletal growth. Specific morphogenetic anomalies were seen in Achilles tendon, along with FBN1 accumulation. Thus, ADAMTSL2, shown here to bind fibrillin microfibrils in vitro, limits fibrillin microfibril formation in tendons and promotes tendon growth. The findings suggest that reduced bone growth in geleophysic dysplasia results from external tethering by short tendons rather than intrinsic growth plate anomalies.","Anti-cancer uses of non-oncology drugs have been found on occasion, but such discoveries have been serendipitous and rare. We sought to create a public resource containing the growth inhibitory activity of 4,518 drugs tested across 578 human cancer cell lines. To accomplish this, we used PRISM, which involves drug treatment of molecularly barcoded cell lines in pools. Relative barcode abundance following treatment thus reflects cell line viability. We found that an unexpectedly large number of non-oncology drugs selectively inhibited subsets of cancer cell lines. Moreover, the killing activity of the majority of these drugs was predictable based on the molecular features of the cell lines. Follow-up of several of these compounds revealed novel mechanisms. For example, compounds that kill by inducing PDE3A-SLFN12 complex formation; vanadium-containing compounds whose killing is dependent on the sulfate transporter SLC26A2; the alcohol dependence drug disulfiram, which kills cells with low expression of metallothioneins; and the anti-inflammatory drug tepoxalin, whose killing is dependent on high expression of the multi-drug resistance gene ABCB1. These results illustrate the potential of the PRISM drug repurposing resource as a starting point for new oncology therapeutic development. The resource is available at https://depmap.org.","Understanding the connectivity patterns of genes in a localized disease neighborhood or disease module in a molecular interaction network (interactome) is a key step toward advancing the knowledge about molecular mechanisms underlying a complex disease. In this work, we introduce a framework that detects peripheral and core regions of a disease in the human interactome. We leverage gene expression data on 104 diseases and analyze the connectivity of differentially expressed genes (quantified by a p-value &lt; 0.05) and their topological membership in the network to distinguish between peripheral and core genes. Per definition, peripheral and core genes are topologically different and we show that they also differ biologically. Core genes are more enriched for Genome-wide association study (GWAS) and Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) data, whereas peripheral genes are more shared across different disease states and their overlap helps predict disease proximity in the human interactome. Based on this observation, we propose a flower model to explain the organization of genes in the human interactome, with core genes of different diseases as the petals and the peripheral genes as the (shared) stem. We show that this network model is an important step towards finding novel drug targets and improving disease classification. Overall, we were able to demonstrate how perturbations percolate through the human interactome and contribute to peripheral and core regions, an important novel feature of the omnigenic model.","Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) are the central component of peripheral immune tolerance. While dysregulation of the Treg cytokine signature has been observed in autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and type 1 diabetes, the regulatory mechanisms balancing pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine production are not known. Here, we identify imbalance between IFN\u03b3 and IL-10 as a shared Treg signature, present in patients with MS and under high salt conditions. By performing RNA-seq analysis on human Treg subpopulations, we identify \u03b2-catenin as a key regulator that controls the expression of IFN\u03b3 and IL-10. The activated \u03b2-catenin signature is enriched specifically in IFN\u03b3+Tregs in humans, and this was confirmed in vivo with Treg-specific \u03b2-catenin-stabilized mice exhibiting lethal autoimmunity with a dysfunctional, IFN\u03b3-producing, Treg phenotype. Moreover, we identify PTGER2 as a major factor balancing IFN\u03b3 and IL-10 production in the context of a high salt environment, with skewed activation of the \u03b2-catenin/SGK1/Foxo axis in IFN\u03b3+Tregs. These findings identify a novel molecular mechanism underlying inflammatory Tregs in human autoimmune disease and reveal a new role for a PTGER2-\u03b2-catenin loop in Tregs linking environmental high salt conditions to autoimmunity.","This study aimed to assess the renopreventive effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), enalapril, and/or vitamin D receptor (VDR) activator, paricalcitol, on streptozotocin (STZ) diabetes-induced nephropathy and to elucidate the mechanisms of action through investigation of the effects on renal oxidative stress, antioxidant defense system and expressions of TNF-\u03b1, P53, caspase-3, and Bcl-2. Diabetes mellitus was induced in fasting male Wistar rats by single intraperitoneal injection of STZ (45 mg /kg b.w.) dissolved in citrate buffer pH 4.5. Ten days after STZ injection, the diabetic rats were treated with enalapril (25 mg/l of drinking water) and/or paricalcitol (8 \u00b5g/kg b.w. per os) dissolved in 5% DMSO daily for 4 weeks. The obtained data revealed that the treatment of diabetic Wistar rats with enalapril and/or paricalcitol led to a significant decrease in the elevated serum urea, uric acid, creatinine and sodium, potassium levels; thereby reflecting improvement of the impaired kidney function. The deteriorated kidney lipid peroxidation, GSH content and GST and catalase activities in diabetic rats were significantly ameliorated as a result of treatment with enalapril and/or paricalcitol. The elevated fasting and post-prandial serum glucose levels and the lowered serum insulin and C-peptide levels were also improved. Moreover, the treatment of diabetic rats successfully prevented the diabetes-induced histopathological deleterious changes of kidney and islets of Langerhans of pancreas. In association, the immunohistochemically detected pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1 and apoptotic mediators P53 and caspase-3 were remarkably decreased in kidney of diabetic rats as a result of treatment, while the expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 was increased. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that enalapril and paricalcitol can prevent STZ diabetes-induced nephropathy though amelioration of the glycemic state and antioxidant defense system together with the suppression of oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis.","OBJECTIVE To evaluate the strength and validity of evidence on the association between the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) or tumour-associated neutrophils (TAN) and cancer prognosis.","","Calcium (Ca) absorption from the intestinal tract is promoted by active vitamin D (1\u03b1,25D3). Vitamin D not only promotes Ca homeostasis, but it also inhibits bone resorption and promotes osteogenesis, thus playing a role in the maintenance of normal bone metabolism. Because 1\u03b1,25D3 plays an important role in osteogenesis, vitamin D formulations, such as alfacalcidol (ALF) and eldecalcitol (ELD), are used for treating osteoporosis. While it is known that, in contrast to ALF, ELD is an active ligand that directly acts on bone, the reason for its superior osteogenesis effects is unknown. Cyp27b1-knockout mice (Cyp27b1\u2212/\u2212 mice) are congenitally deficient in 1\u03b1,25D3 and exhibit marked hypocalcemia and high parathyroid hormone levels, resulting in osteodystrophy involving bone hypocalcification and growth plate cartilage hypertrophy. However, because the vitamin D receptor is expressed normally in Cyp27b1\u2212/\u2212 mice, they respond normally to 1\u03b1,25D3. Accordingly, in Cyp27b1\u2212/\u2212 mice, the pharmacological effects of exogenously administered active vitamin D derivatives can be analyzed without being affected by 1\u03b1,25D3. We used Cyp27b1\u2212/\u2212 mice to characterize and clarify the superior osteogenic effects of ELD on the bone in comparison with ALF. The results indicated that compared to ALF, ELD strongly induces ECaC2, calbindin-D9k, and CYP24A1 in the duodenum, promoting Ca absorption and decreasing the plasma concentration of 1\u03b1,25D3, resulting in improved osteogenesis. Because bone morphological measurements demonstrated that ELD has stronger effects on bone calcification, trabecular formation, and cancellous bone density than ALF, ELD appears to be a more effective therapeutic agent for treating postmenopausal osteoporosis, in which cancellous bone density decreases markedly. By using Cyp27b1\u2212/\u2212 mice, this study was the first to succeed in clarifying the osteogenic effect of ELD without any influence of endogenous 1\u03b1,25D3. Furthermore, ELD more strongly enhanced bone mineralization, trabecular proliferation, and cancellous bone density than did ALF. Thus, ELD is expected to show an effect on postmenopausal osteoporosis, in which cancellous bone mineral density decreases markedly.","Detection of Gram-negative bacterial lipid A by the extracellular sensor, MD-2/TLR4 or the intracellular inflammasome sensors, CASP4 and CASP5, induces robust inflammatory responses. The chemical structure of lipid A, specifically the phosphorylation and acylation state, varies across and within bacterial species, potentially allowing pathogens to evade or suppress host immunity. Currently, it is not clear how distinct alterations in the phosphorylation or acylation state of lipid A affect both human TLR4 and CASP4/5 activation. Using a panel of engineered lipooligosaccharides (LOS) derived from Yersinia pestis with defined lipid A structures that vary in their acylation or phosphorylation state, we identified that differences in phosphorylation state did not affect TLR4 or CASP4/5 activation. However, the acylation state differentially impacted TLR4 and CASP4/5 activation. Specifically, all of the examined tetra-, penta-, and hexa-acylated LOS variants activated CASP4/5-dependent responses, whereas TLR4 responded to penta- and hexa-acylated LOS but did not respond to tetra-acylated LOS or pentaacylated LOS lacking the secondary acyl chain at the 3\u2019 position. As expected, lipid A alone was sufficient for TLR4 activation; however, human macrophages required both lipid A and the core oligosaccharide to mount a robust CASP4/5 inflammasome response. Our findings show that human TLR4 and CASP4/5 detect both shared and non-overlapping LOS/lipid A structures, which enables the innate immune system to recognize a wider range of bacterial LOS/lipid A, thereby constraining the ability of pathogens to evade innate immune detection.","Fabrication of microfluidic devices by photolithography generally requires specialized training and access to a cleanroom. As an alternative, 3D printing enables cost-effective fabrication of microdevices with complex features that would be suitable for many biomedical applications. However, commonly used resins are cytotoxic and unsuitable for devices involving cells. Furthermore, 3D prints are generally refractory to elastomer polymerization such that they cannot be used as master molds for fabricating devices from polymers (e.g. polydimethylsiloxane, or PDMS). Different post-print treatment strategies, such as heat curing, ultraviolet light exposure, and coating with silanes, have been explored to overcome these obstacles, but none have proven universally effective. Here, we show that deposition of a thin layer of parylene, a polymer commonly used for medical device applications, renders 3D prints biocompatible and allows them to be used as master molds for elastomeric device fabrication. When placed in culture dishes containing human neurons, regardless of resin type, uncoated 3D prints leached toxic material to yield complete cell death within 48 hours, whereas cells exhibited uniform viability and healthy morphology out to 21 days if the prints were coated with parylene. Diverse PDMS devices of different shapes and sizes were easily casted from parylene-coated 3D printed molds without any visible defects. As a proof-of-concept, we rapid prototyped and tested different types of PDMS devices, including triple chamber perfusion chips, droplet generators, and microwells. Overall, we suggest that the simplicity and reproducibility of this technique will make it attractive for fabricating traditional microdevices and rapid prototyping new designs. In particular, by minimizing user intervention on the fabrication and post-print treatment steps, our strategy could help make microfluidics more accessible to the biomedical research community.","COVID-19 is the current pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that uses ACE2 protein on the cell surface. By analyzing publicly available datasets, I uncovered that alveolar early progenitors (AEP), a subset of the type-2 pneumocytes, showed increased ACE2 expression in the older lungs. AEPs co-express TMPRSS2, CTSL. Aged AEP-gene expression signature suggested an active response to beta-amyloid-induced ACE2 shedding, to limit the intercellular beta-amyloid accumulation in otherwise healthy human lungs. Susceptibility of AEP to SARS-CoV2 and ACE2 secretory capacity of these cells makes aged human lung sensitive for rapid-infection, by a possible in-solution ACE2 binding and entry into ACE2-negative cells, thereby increasing the target cell diversity and numbers. Single-cell analysis of COVID19 patients with moderate and severe infections, clearly showed that severe infections showed SARS-CoV-2 transcript in ACE2-negative TMPRSS-negative but CTSL-positive cell types in their bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, validating in-solution ACE2-binding enabling infection.","Targeted DNA sequences conservation analyses of 17 primate species demonstrated that human endogenous retroviruses (HERV) LTR7/HERVH and LTR5_Hs/HERVK appear to have distinct evolutionary histories charted by evidence of the earliest presence and expansion of highly-conserved (HC) LTR sequences. HC-LTR7 loci were mapped to genomes of Old World Monkeys (18% of all HC-LTR7 loci), suggesting that LTR7/HERVH have entered germlines of primates in Africa after the separation of the New World Monkey lineage. HC-LTR5_Hs loci have been identified in the Gibbon\u2019s genome (24% of all HC-LTR5_Hs loci), suggesting that LTR5_Hs/HERVK successfully colonized primates\u2019 germlines after the segregation of Gibbons\u2019 species. Subsequently, both LTR7 and LTR5_Hs undergo a marked \u223c4-5-fold expansion in genomes of Great Apes. Timelines of quantitative expansion of both LTR7 and LTR5_Hs loci during evolution of Great Apes appear to replicate the consensus evolutionary sequence of increasing cognitive and behavioral complexities of non-human primates, which seems particularly striking for LTR7 loci and 11 distinct LTR7 subfamilies.","Single-cell multi-omics technology is able to measure cells from multiple data modalities. Data integration method aims to integrate cells across data batches and modalities, and learn a comprehensive view of the cells. Data integration can be categorized into horizontal, vertical, diagonal, and mosaic integration, where mosaic integration is the most general and the most challenging case. Most of the existing data integration methods can only work with the first three cases, which constrains their applicability to various data integration tasks. We propose scMoMaT, a method that is able to integrate single cell multi-omics data under the mosaic scenario using matrix tri-factorization. The framework of scMoMaT makes it possible to uncover the cell type specific bio-markers at the same time when learning a unified cell representation. Moreover, scMoMaT can integrate cell batches with unequal cell type composition. Applying scMoMaT to multiple biological datasets shows that scMoMaT has superior performance compared to baseline methods.","Patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) often present with skeletal abnormalities; a condition known as renal osteodystrophy (ROD). While Tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) and PHOSPHO1 are recognized to be critical for bone mineralization, their role in the etiology of ROD is unclear. To address this, ROD was induced in both wild-type and Phospho1 knockout (P1KO) mice using dietary adenine supplementation. The mice presented with hyperphosphatemia, hyperparathyroidism, and elevated levels of FGF23 and bone turnover markers. In particular, we noted that in CKD mice, bone mineral density (BMD) was increased in cortical bone (p &lt; 0.05) but decreased in trabecular bone (p &lt; 0.05). These changes were accompanied by decreased TNAP (p &lt; 0.01) and increased PHOSPHO1 (p &lt; 0.001) expression in wild-type CKD bones. In P1KO CKD mice, the cortical BMD phenotype was rescued, suggesting that the increased cortical BMD of CKD mice was driven by increased PHOSPHO1 expression. Other structural parameters were also improved in P1KO CKD mice. We further investigated the driver of the mineralization defects, by studying the effects of FGF23, PTH, and phosphate administration on PHOSPHO1 and TNAP expression by primary murine osteoblasts. We found both PHOSPHO1 and TNAP expression to be down-regulated in response to phosphate and PTH. While matrix mineralization was increased with phosphate (Pi), it decreased with PTH and FGF23 had no effect. The in vitro data suggest that the TNAP reduction in CKD-MBD is driven by the hyperphosphatemia and/or hyperparathyroidism noted in these mice, while the higher PHOSPHO1 expression may be a compensatory mechanism in an attempt to protect the bone from hypomineralization. We propose that increased PHOSPHO1 expression in ROD may contribute to the disordered skeletal mineralization characteristic of this progressive disorder.","Over a decade of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have led to the finding of extreme polygenicity of complex traits. The phenomenon that \u201call genes affect every complex trait\u201d complicates Mendelian Randomization (MR) studies, where natural genetic variations are used as instruments to infer the causal effect of heritable risk factors. We reexamine the assumptions of existing MR methods and show how they need to be clarified to allow for pervasive horizontal pleiotropy and heterogeneous effect sizes. We propose a comprehensive framework GRAPPLE to analyze the causal effect of target risk factors with heterogeneous genetic instruments and identify possible pleiotropic patterns from data. By using GWAS summary statistics, GRAPPLE can efficiently use both strong and weak genetic instruments, detect the existence of multiple pleiotropic pathways, determine the causal direction and perform multivariable MR to adjust for confounding risk factors. With GRAPPLE, we analyze the effect of blood lipids, body mass index, and systolic blood pressure on 25 disease outcomes, gaining new information on their causal relationships and the potential pleiotropic pathways.","Since the emergence of CoVID-19 pandemic in China in late 2019, scientists are striving hard to explore non-toxic, viable anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds or medicines. We determined In Vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of oral formulations (syrup and capsule) of an Iodine-complex (Renessans). A monolayer of vero cells were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in the presence and absence of different concentrations (equivalent to 50, 05 and 0.5 \u03bcg/ml of I2) of Renessans. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of each of the formulation was assessed in the form of cell survival, SARS-CoV-2-specific cytopathic effect (CPE) and genome quantization. With varying concentrations of syrup and capsule, a varying rate of inhibition of CPE, cells survival and virus replication was observed. Compared to 0.5 \u03bcg/ml concentration of Renessans syrup, 5 and 50 \u03bcg/ml showed comparable results where there was a 100% cell survival, no CPEs and a negligible viral replication (\u0394CT= 0.11 and 0.13, respectively). This study indicates that Renessans, containing iodine, may have potential activity against SARS-CoV-2 which needs to be further investigated in human clinical trials.","Background and Aims Intestinal homeostasis is maintained by specialized host cells and the gut microbiota. Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling is essential for gastrointestinal development and homeostasis, and its dysregulation has been implicated in inflammation and colorectal cancer. Axin1 negatively regulates activated Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling, but little is known regarding its role in regulating host-microbial interactions in health and disease. Here, we aim to demonstrate that intestinal Axin1 determines gut homeostasis and host response to inflammation.","Drug research with animal models is expensive, time-consuming and translation to clinical trials is often poor, resulting in a desire to replace, reduce, and refine the use of animal models. One approach to replace and reduce the use of animal models in research is using in vitro cell-culture models.","Bacteriophages (phages), Earth\u2019s most numerous biological entities, are natural constituents of alimentary matrices; in this study we describe the characterization of phage populations in a product obtained by fermentation of bovine milk and colostrum. Such characterizations were achieved using a microarray consisting of a chip covered in short DNA sequences that are specific to certain target organisms for a total of approximately 12,000 species. The only viruses evidenced by the array belonged to Siphoviridae, the largest phage family that targets bacteria and archea. The array yielded 27 iterations corresponding to a unique target. We discuss the putative role of some open reading frames of these phages in conferring health-supporting properties with particular reference to cells signaling and neurological development. We also describe the in vitro interaction of this fermented product with alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, an enzyme whose activity in serum is elevated in neurodevelopmental disorders.","Bacterial phosphosignaling has long been synonymous with the histidine kinases of the two component systems, but many bacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), also code for Ser/Thr protein kinases (STPKs). STPKs are the main phosphosignaling enzymes in eukaryotes, but the full extent of phosphorylation on protein Ser/Thr and Tyr (O-phosphorylation) in bacteria remains unclear. Here, we explored the global signaling capacity of the STPKs in Mtb. We generated STPK loss-and gain-of-function strains and measured the resulting O-phosphorylation and transcriptional changes. This deep phosphoproteome shows that O-phosphorylation in Mtb is an underexplored protein modification that affects &gt;70% of the proteome. The substrate-STPK interactions show an extensive interface with the transcriptional machinery, resulting in regulation of gene expression of \u223c30% of Mtb genes. Mtb O-phosphorylation gives rise to an expansive, distributed, and cooperative network of a complexity that has previously only been associated with eukaryotic phosphosignaling networks.","Mesenchymal stem cells have been the focus of intense research in bone development and regeneration. We demonstrate the potential of microparticles as modulating moieties of osteogenic response by utilizing their architectural features. Topographically textured microparticles of varying microscale features were produced by exploiting phase-separation of a readily-soluble sacrificial component from polylactic acid. The influence of varying topographical features on primary human mesenchymal stem cell attachment, proliferation and markers of osteogenesis was investigated. In the absence of osteoinductive supplements, cells cultured on textured microparticles exhibited notably increased expression of osteogenic markers relative to conventional smooth microparticles. They also exhibited varying morphological, attachment and proliferation responses. Significantly altered gene expression and metabolic profiles were observed, with varying histological characteristics in vivo. This study highlights how tailoring topographical design offers cell-instructive 3D microenvironments which allow manipulation of stem cell fate by eliciting the desired downstream response without use of exogenous osteoinductive factors.","Female mammalian cells harbor two X chromosomes, one of maternal and one of paternal origin. During development, one X randomly inactivates1\u20134. This renders either the maternal or paternal X active, causing X mosaicism that varies among individual females, with some showing considerable or complete skew in the general female population5\u20137. Parent-of-X-origin can modify epigenetics via DNA methylation8, 9 and possibly gene expression; thus, mosaicism could buffer dysregulated processes in aging and disease. However, whether X skewing \u2013 or its mosaicism \u2013 alters functions in females is largely unknown. Here we tested whether skew toward the maternal X (Xm) influences key functions of the body. Among cardiac, bone, metabolic, and brain functions, Xm selectively impaired cognition in female mice throughout the lifespan. Cognitive deficits were accompanied by Xm-mediated acceleration of biologic or epigenetic aging of the female hippocampus, a key center for learning and memory. Xm showed epigenetic imprinting of several genes within hippocampal neurons, suggesting silenced cognitive loci. Thus, the maternal X chromosome impaired cognition, accelerated brain aging, and silenced genes. Understanding how the maternal X impairs brain function could lead to new understanding of female heterogeneity in cognitive heath and to X chromosome-derived pathways against cognitive deficits and brain aging.","Three-dimensional (3D) imaging of osteocyte lacunae has recently substantiated the connection between lacunar shape and size, and osteocyte age, viability, and mechanotransduction. Yet it remains unclear why individual osteocytes reshape their lacunae and how networks of osteocytes change in response to local alterations in mechanical loads. We evaluated the effects of local mechanical stimuli on osteocyte lacunar morphometrics in tibial cortical bone from young female mice flown on the Space Shuttle for \u223c13 days. We optimized scan parameters, using a laboratory-based submicrometer-resolution X-Ray Microscope, to achieve large \u223c 0.3 mm3 fields of view with sufficient resolution (\u2265 0.3 \u03bcm) to visualize and measure thousands of lacunae per scan. Our novel approach avoids large measurement errors that are inherent in 2D and enables a facile 3D solution as compared to the lower resolution from benchtop micro-computed tomography (CT) systems or the cost and inaccessibility of synchrotron-based CT. Osteocyte lacunae were altered following microgravity exposure in a region-specific manner: more elongated (+7.0% Stretch) in predominately tensile-loaded bone as compared to those in compressively-loaded regions. In compressively-loaded bone, lacunae formed in microgravity were significantly larger (+6.9% Volume) than in the same region formed on Earth. We also evaluated lacunar heterogeneity (i.e., spatial autocorrelation of lacunar morphometric parameters) via kriging models. These statistical models demonstrated that heterogeneity varied with underlying spatial contributors, i.e. the local mechanical and biological environment. Yet in the absence of gravitational loading, osteocyte lacunae in newly formed bone were larger and were collectively more homogenous than in bone formed on Earth. Overall, this study shows that osteocyte reshape their lacunae in response to changes, or absence, in local mechanical stimuli and different biological environments. Additionally, spatial relationships among osteocytes are complex and necessitate evaluation in carefully selected regions of interest and of large cell populations.","Objective We aimed to investigate the skeletal phenotype of Winnie mouse model of spontaneous chronic colitis, which carries a mutation in the Muc2 gene and closely replicates IBD symptoms and pathophysiology. These mice have a high level of gut-derived serotonin (GDS), a potent osteoblastogenesis inhibitor. We explored the underlying mechanisms of bone loss associated with chronic intestinal inflammation.","Offspring health outcomes are often linked with epigenetic alterations triggered by maternal nutrition and intrauterine environment. Strong experimental data also link paternal preconception nutrition with pathophysiology in the offspring, but the mechanism(s) routing the effects of paternal exposures remain elusive. Animal experimental models have highlighted small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) as potential regulators of paternal effects, though less is known about the existence of similar mechanisms in human sperm. Here, we first characterised the baseline sncRNA landscape of human sperm, and then studied the effects of a 6-week diet intervention on their expression profile. Baseline profiling identified 5\u2019tRFs, miRNAs and piRNAs to be the most abundant sncRNA subtypes, primarily expressed from regulatory elements like UTRs, CpG-rich regions and promoters. Expression of a subset of these sncRNAs varied with age, BMI and sperm quality of the donor. Diet intervention enriched in vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids showed a marked increase of these nutrients in circulation and altered the sperm sncRNA expression. These included 3 tRFs, 15 miRNAs and 112 piRNAs, with gene targets involved in fatty acid metabolism, vitamin D response (LXR/RXR activation, TGF-beta and Wnt signaling), and transposable elements. These findings provide evidence that human sperms are sensitive to alterations in exposures such as diet, and sncRNAs capture the epigenetic imprint of this change. Hence changes to paternal nutrition during preconception may improve sperm quality and offspring health outcomes. To benefit future research, we developed iDad_DB, an open access database of baseline and diet-altered sncRNA in human male germline.","The advance in microbiome and metabolome studies has generated rich omics data revealing the involvement of the microbial community in host disease pathogenesis through interactions with their host at a metabolic level. However, the computational tools to uncover these relationships are just emerging. Here, we present MiMeNet, a neural network framework for modeling microbe-metabolite relationships. Using ten iterations of 10-fold cross-validation on three paired microbiome-metabolome datasets, we show that MiMeNet more accurately predicts metabolite abundances (mean Spearman correlation coefficients increase from 0.108 to 0.309, 0.276 to 0.457, and -0.272 to 0.264) and identifies more well-predicted metabolites (increase in the number of well-predicted metabolites from 198 to 366, 104 to 143, and 4 to 29) compared to state-of-art linear models for individual metabolite predictions. Additionally, we demonstrate that MiMeNet can group microbes and metabolites with similar interaction patterns and functions to illuminate the underlying structure of the microbe-metabolite interaction network, which could potentially shed light on uncharacterized metabolites through \u201cGuilt by Association\u201d. Our results demonstrated that MiMeNet is a powerful tool to provide insights into the causes of metabolic dysregulation in disease, facilitating future hypothesis generation at the interface of the microbiome and metabolomics.","Ischemic stroke (IS) is a highly heritable trait. Genome-wide association studies have identified several commonly occurring susceptibility risk loci for this condition. However, there are limited data on the contribution of rare genetic variation to IS. We conducted a whole-exome association study of IS in 152,058 UK Biobank participants (mean age 57, 6.8 [SD 8.0], 83,131 [54.7%] were females), including 1,777 IS cases (mean age 61.4 [SD 6.6], 666 [37.5%] were females). We performed single-variant analyses for all variants and gene-based analyses for loss of function and deleterious missense rare variants. In the gene-based analysis, rare genetic variation at CYP2R1 was significantly associated with IS risk (P=2.6E-6), exceeding the Bonferroni-corrected threshold for 16,074 tests (P&lt;3.1E-6). We first replicated these findings using summary statistics from a genome-wide association study that included 67,162 IS cases and 454,450 controls (gene-based test for CYP2R1, P=0.003). We pursued a second replication focused on IS recurrence using individual-level data from 1,706 IS survivors, including 142 cases of recurrent IS, enrolled in the VISP trial (gene-based test for CYP2R1, P=0.001). We also found that common genetic variation at CYP2R1 was associated with white matter hyperintensity volume (42,310 participants) and both mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy (17,663 participants) in the subcohort of UK Biobank (all gene-based tests P&lt;0.05). Because CYP2R1 plays an important role in vitamin D metabolism, our results support a role of this pathway in the occurrence of ischemic cerebrovascular disease.","Background Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, of which over 2000 have been reported to date. Mutations have yet to be analyzed in aggregate to assess their distribution across the tertiary structure of the CFTR protein, an approach that could provide valuable insights into the structure-function relationship of CFTR. In addition, the binding site of Class I correctors (VX-809, VX-661, C18) is not well understood.","Ischemic brain injury represents insufficient oxygen supply to the brain and further damage occurs upon reoxygenation due to elevated intracellular levels excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate and subsequent production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which has long been related to neuronal cell death of hippocampus brain region. Previously, using cell biological assay and transcriptomics analysis we reported that naturally occurring phytosterol Stigmasterol (ST) promotes brain development and function through the enhancement of neuronal cytoarchitectural complexity and functional maturation in rat hippocampal neurons by induction of immediate early genes (IEGs). In the present study we investigated the STs role in neuroprotection and found that ST also dose-dependently increased the neuronal viability in hypoxia reoxygenation (H/R) induced injury at hippocampal culture. ST, at an optimal concentration of 20 \u03bcM, significantly reduced the transport of vesicular glutamate (VGULT1), synaptic vesicle pool size, expression of GluN2B, rate of ROS formation (DCFDA) but restore mitochondrial membrane potential (JC1) and DNA fragmentation (H2AX) against H/R induced injury. More interestingly, ST also significantly induces the expression of autophagy marker protein LC3BII and the adaptor protein P62 but not HSC70 which indicates STs capability of induction of chaperon independent autophagy at H/R treated cultures. Furthermore densitometric analysis reveals ST also significantly increases PINK1 (PTEN induced protein kinase 1) expression therefore, indicates its role in mitophagy. In addition, molecular dynamic simulations study indicates that ST bind to LXR\u03b2 and forms hydrogen bonds with ASN239, GLU281, ARG319, THR316, SER278, ASN239 and SER278 residues at high occupancy with GLU281(20.21%) and ARG319 (21.04%,) residues, which is necessary for sterol binding to the LXR\u03b2. Taken together these findings suggest that neuroprotective effect of ST might be associated with anti-excitatory and anti-oxidative actions on CNS neurons and could be a promising drug candidate for the treatment or prevention of ischemic stroke related neurological disorders.","Background Hypocalcaemia has been reported in the context of acute COVID-19, where it has been associated with an increased risk of hospitalisation and disease severity. Calcium is an important intracellular messenger that controls diverse cellular processes. Two other clinically important coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, can use calcium ions to enter and replicate within host cells. Calcium may therefore be important in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 infection. We sought to investigate whether calcium derangement was a specific feature of COVID-19 that distinguishes it from other infective pneumonias, and its association with disease severity.","Artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) catalyzing new-to-nature reactions under mild conditions could play an important role in the transition to a sustainable, circular economy. While ArMs have been created for a variety of bioorthogonal transformations, attempts at optimizing their performance by enzyme engineering have been case-specific and resulted only in modest improvements. To realize the full potential of ArMs, methods that enable the rapid discovery of highly active ArM variants for any reaction of interest are required. Here, we introduce a broadly applicable, automation-compatible ArM engineering platform, which relies on periplasmic compartmentalization in Escherichia coli to rapidly and reliably identify improved ArM variants based on the biotin-streptavidin technology. We systematically assess 400 ArM mutants for five bioorthogonal transformations involving different metal cofactors, reaction mechanisms and substrate-product pairs, including novel ArMs for gold-catalyzed hydroamination and hydroarylation. The achieved activity enhancements of up to fifteen-fold over wild type highlight the potential of the systematic approach to ArM engineering. We further capitalize on the sequence-activity data to suggest and validate smart strategies for future screening campaigns. This systematic, multi-reaction study has important implications for the development of highly active ArMs for novel applications in biocatalysis and synthetic biology.","UV-C processing of whole milk (WM) using a designed pilot scale Dean flow system was conducted at flow rates (11.88, 23.77, and 47.55 gph), Reynolds number ranges from 2890-11562 and the Dean number (at curved region) calculated as (648-2595) to inactivate bacterial endospores and virus particles. Biodosimetry studies were conducted to quantify the reduction equivalent fluence at selected experimental conditions. Results revealed that the fluence distribution improved as flow rate increases, attributed to increase in Dean effects and turbulence intensity. Microbial inactivation studies conducted at 47.55 gph showed 0.91 \u00b1 0.15 and 2.14 \u00b1 0.19 log reduction/ pass for B. cereus endospores and T1UV phage. Linear inactivation trend was observed against number of passes which clearly demonstrates equivalent fluence delivery during each pass. Lipid peroxidation value and volatiles profile did not change significantly at UV fluence of 60 mJ/cm2. Lower EEO value signifies the higher electrical efficiency of the system.","Ciliopathies represent a disease class characterized by a broad range of phenotypes including polycystic kidneys and skeletal anomalies. Ciliopathic skeletal phenotypes are among the most common and most difficult to treat due to a poor understanding of the pathological mechanisms leading to disease. Using an avian model (talpid2) for a human ciliopathy with skeletal anomalies (Orofaciodigital syndrome 14), we identified disruptions in the FGF23-PTH axis that resulted in reduced calcium uptake in the developing mandible and subsequent micrognathia. While pharmacological intervention with the FDA-approved pan-FGFR inhibitor AZD4547 alone rescued expression of the FGF target Sprouty2, it did not significantly rescue micrognathia. In contrast, treatment with a cocktail of AZD4547 and Teriparatide acetate, a PTH agonist and FDA-approved treatment for osteoporosis, resulted in a molecular, cellular, and phenotypic rescue of ciliopathic micrognathia in talpid2 mutants. Together, these data provide novel insight into pathological molecular mechanisms associated with ciliopathic skeletal phenotypes and a potential therapeutic strategy for a pleiotropic disease class with limited to no treatment options.","Human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) is associated with respiratory disease and is prevalent worldwide, but in vitro model for virus replication is lacking. Interaction between the coronaviral spike (S) protein and its receptor is the major determinant of virus tissue and host specificity, but virus entry is a complex process requiring a concerted action of multiple cellular elements. Here, we show that KLK13 is required for the infection of the human respiratory epithelium and is sufficient to mediate the entry of HCoV-HKU1 to non-permissive RD cells. We also demonstrated HCoV-HKU1 S protein cleavage by KLK13 in the S1/S2 region, proving that KLK13 is the priming enzyme for this virus. Summarizing, we show for the first time that protease distribution and specificity predetermines the tissue and cell specificity of the virus and may also regulate interspecies transmission. It is also of importance that presented data may be relevant for the emerging coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and may help to understand the differences in their zoonotic potential.","Alternatively activated macrophages are essential effector cells during type 2 immunity and tissue repair following helminth infections. We previously showed that Ym1, an alternative activation marker, can drive innate IL-1R-dependent neutrophil recruitment during infection with the lung-migrating nematode, Nippostrongylus brasiliensis suggesting a potential role for the inflammasome in the IL-1-mediated innate response to infection. While inflammasome proteins such as NLRP3 have important pro-inflammatory functions in macrophages, their role during type 2 responses and repair are less defined. We therefore infected Nlrp3\u2212/\u2212 mice with N. brasiliensis. Unexpectedly, compared to WT mice, infected Nlrp3\u2212/\u2212 mice had increased neutrophilia and eosinophilia, correlating with enhanced worm killing but at the expense of increased tissue damage and delayed lung repair. Transcriptional profiling showed that infected Nlrp3\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited elevated type 2 gene expression compared to WT mice. Notably, inflammasome activation was not evident early post-infection with N. brasiliensis and in contrast to Nlrp3\u2212/\u2212 mice, anti-helminth responses were unaffected in caspase-1/11 deficient or WT mice treated with the NLRP3-specific inhibitor MCC950. Together these data suggest that NLRP3 can constrain lung neutrophilia and helminth killing and negatively regulate type 2 immune responses in an inflammasome-independent manner.","Actual causes of Parkinsons disease (PD) are still unknown. In any case, a better comprehension of genetic and ecological influences to the PD and their interaction will assist physicians and patients to evaluate individual hazard for the PD, and definitely, there will be a possibility to find a way to reduce the progression of the PD. We introduced quantitative frameworks to reveal the complex relationship of various biasing genetic factors for the PD. In this study, we analyzed gene expression microarray data from the PD, ageing (AG), severe alcohol consumption (AC), type II diabetes (T2D), high body fat (HBF), hypercholesterolemia (HC), high dietary fat (HDF), red meat dietary (RMD), sedentary lifestyle (SL), smoking (SM), and control datasets. We have developed genetic associations of various factors with the PD based on the neighborhood-based benchmarking and multilayer network topology.","Mycobacterium tuberculosis lung infection results in a complex multicellular structure, the granuloma. In some granulomas, immune activity promotes bacterial clearance; in others, bacteria persist and grow. We identified correlates of bacterial control in cynomolgus macaque lung granulomas by co-registering longitudinal PET-CT imaging, single-cell RNA-sequencing, and measures of bacterial clearance. We find that bacterial persistence occurs in granulomas enriched for mast, endothelial, fibroblast and plasma cells, signaling amongst themselves via Type II immunity and wound healing pathways. In contrast, these interactions are largely absent in granulomas that drive bacterial control, which are often those that form later in the course of infection; these restrictive lesions are characterized by cellular ecosystems enriched for Type1-Type17, stem-like, and cytotoxic T cells engaged in pro-inflammatory signaling networks that involve diverse myeloid and non-immune cell populations. There is also a temporal aspect to bacterial control, in that granulomas that arise later in infection (in the context of an established immune response) share the functional characteristics of restrictive granulomas and are more capable of killing Mtb. Taken together, our results define the complex multicellular ecosystems underlying (lack of) granuloma resolution and highlight host immune targets that can be leveraged to develop new vaccine and therapeutic strategies for TB.","Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a highly prevalent demyelinating autoimmune condition; the mechanisms regulating its severity and progression are unclear. The IL-17-producing Th17 subset of T cells has been widely implicated in MS and in the mouse model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). However, the differentiation and regulation of Th17 cells during EAE remain incompletely understood. Although evidence is mounting that the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin profoundly affects early T cell differentiation, no studies have looked at its role in longer term T cell responses. Now, we report that cathelicidin drives severe EAE disease. It is released from neutrophils, microglia and endothelial cells throughout disease; its interaction with T cells potentiates Th17 differentiation in lymph nodes and Th17 to exTh17 plasticity and IFN-\u03b3 production in the spinal cord. As a consequence, mice lacking cathelicidin are protected from severe EAE. In addition, we show that cathelicidin is produced by the same cell types in the active brain lesions in human MS disease. We propose that cathelicidin exposure results in highly activated, cytokine-producing T cells which drive autoimmunity; this is a mechanism through which neutrophils amplify inflammation in the central nervous system.","It is known that bipolar disorder and its lithium treatment involve the modulation of oxidative stress. Moreover, it has been observed that lithium\u2019s effects are isotope-dependent. Based on these findings, here we propose that lithium exerts its effects by influencing the recombination dynamics of a naturally occurring radical pair involving oxygen. We develop a simple model inspired by the radical-pair mechanism in cryptochrome in the context of avian magnetoreception and xenon-induced anesthesia. Our model reproduces the observed isotopic dependence in the lithium treatment of hyperactivity in rats. It predicts a magnetic-field dependence of the effectiveness of lithium, which provides one potential experimental test of our hypothesis. Our findings show that Nature might harness quantum entanglement for the brain\u2019s cognitive processes.","The evolution of complex skeletal traits in primates was likely influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Because skeletal tissues are notoriously challenging to study using functional genomic approaches, they remain poorly characterized even in humans, let alone across multiple species. The challenges involved in obtaining functional genomic data from the skeleton, combined with the difficulty of obtaining such tissues from nonhuman apes, motivated us to consider an alternative in vitro system with which to comparatively study gene regulation in skeletal cell types. Specifically, we differentiated six human and six chimpanzee induced pluripotent stem cell lines (iPSCs) into mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and subsequently into osteogenic cells (bone cells). We validated differentiation using standard methods and collected single-cell RNA sequencing data from over 100,000 cells across multiple samples and replicates at each stage of differentiation. While most genes that we examined display conserved patterns of expression across species, hundreds of genes are differentially expressed (DE) between humans and chimpanzees within and across stages of osteogenic differentiation. Some of these interspecific DE genes show functional enrichments relevant in skeletal tissue trait development. Moreover, topic modeling indicates that interspecific gene programs become more pronounced as cells mature. Overall, we propose that this in vitro model can be used to identify interspecific regulatory differences that may have contributed to skeletal trait differences between species.","Streptococcus pyogenes or group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a leading cause of bacterial pharyngitis, skin and soft tissue infections, life-threatening invasive infections, and the post-infectious autoimmune syndromes of acute rheumatic fever and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Genetic manipulation of this important pathogen is complicated by resistance of the organism to genetic transformation. Very low transformation efficiency is attributed to recognition and degradation of introduced foreign DNA by a type I restriction-modification system encoded by the hsdRSM locus. DNA sequence analysis of this locus in ten GAS strains that had been previously transformed with an unrelated plasmid revealed that six of the ten harbored a spontaneous mutation in hsdR, S, or M. The mutations were all different, and at least five of the six were predicted to result in loss of function of the respective hsd gene product. The unexpected occurrence of such mutations in previously transformed isolates suggested that the process of transformation selects for spontaneous inactivating mutations in the Hsd system. We investigated the possibility of exploiting the increased transformability of hsd mutants by constructing a deletion mutation in hsdM in GAS strain 854, a clinical isolate representative of the globally dominant M1T1 clonal group. Mutant strain 854\u0394hsdM exhibited a 5-fold increase in transformation efficiency compared to the wild type parent strain and no obvious change in growth or off-target gene expression. We conclude that genetic transformation of GAS selects for spontaneous mutants the hsdRSM restriction modification system. We propose that use of a defined hsdM mutant as a parent strain for genetic manipulation of GAS will enhance transformation efficiency and reduce the likelihood of selecting spontaneous hsd mutants with uncharacterized genotypes.","Background Human neutrophils are central players in innate immunity, a major component of inflammatory responses, and a leading model for cell motility and chemotaxis. However, primary neutrophils are remarkably short-lived, limiting their experimental usefulness in the laboratory. Thus, human myeloid cell lines have been established and characterized for their ability to undergo neutrophil-like differentiation in vitro. The HL-60 cell line and its PLB-985 sub-line are commonly used as a model for human neutrophil behavior, but how closely gene expression in differentiated cells resembles that of primary neutrophils has remained unclear.","We exploited genetic information to assess the role of non-genetic factors in multifactorial diseases. To this aim we isolated candidate \u201cinteractomes\u201d (i.e. groups of genes whose products are known to physically interact with environmental exposures and biological processes, plausibly relevant for disease pathogenesis) and analyzed nominal statistical evidence of association with genetic predisposition to multiple sclerosis (MS) and other inflammatory and non-inflammatory complex disorders. The interaction between genotype and Herpesviruses emerged as specific for MS, with Epstein Barr virus (EBV) showing higher levels of significance compared to Human Herpesvirus 8 (HHV8) and, more evidently, to cytomegalovirus (CMV). In accord with this result, when we classified the MS-associated genes contained in the interactomes into canonical pathways, the analysis converged towards biological functions of B cells, in particular the CD40 pathway. When we analyzed peripheral blood transcriptomes in persons with MS, we found a significant dysregulation of MS-associated genes belonging to the EBV interactome in primary progressive MS. This study indicates that the interaction between herpesviruses and predisposing genetic background is of causal significance in MS, and provides a mechanistic explanation for the long-recognized association between EBV and this condition.","Many cell types display the remarkable ability to alter their cellular phenotype in response to specific external or internal signals. Such phenotypic plasticity is apparent in the nematode C. elegans when adverse environmental conditions trigger entry into the dauer diapause stage. This entry is accompanied by structural, molecular and functional remodeling of a number of distinct tissue types of the animal, including its nervous system. The transcription factor effectors of three different hormonal signaling systems, the insulin-responsive DAF-16/FoxO transcription factor, the TGF\u03b2-responsive DAF-3/SMAD transcription factor and the steroid nuclear hormone receptor, DAF-12/VDR, a homolog of the vitamin D receptor, were previously shown to be required for entering the dauer arrest stage, but their cellular and temporal focus of action for the underlying cellular remodeling processes remained incompletely understood. Through the generation of conditional alleles that allowed us to spatially and temporally control gene activity, we show here that all three transcription factors are not only required to initiate tissue remodeling upon entry into the dauer stage, as shown before, but are also continuously required to maintain the remodeled state. We show that DAF-3/SMAD is required in sensory neurons to promote and then maintain animal-wide tissue remodeling events. In contrast, DAF-16/FoxO or DAF-12/VDR act cell autonomously to control anatomical, molecular and behavioral remodeling events in specific cell types. Intriguingly, we also uncover non-cell autonomous function of DAF-16/FoxO and DAF-12/VDR in nervous system remodeling, indicating the presence of several insulin-dependent inter-organ signaling axes. Our findings provide novel perspectives on how hormonal systems control tissue remodeling.","Much of the enormous phenotypic variation observed across human populations is thought to have arisen from events experienced as our ancestors peopled different regions of the world. However, little is known about the genes involved in these population-specific adaptations. Here we explore this problem by simultaneously examining population-specific sequence and expression differentiation in four human populations. In particular, we design a branch-based statistic to estimate population-specific differentiation in four populations, and apply this statistic to single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and RNA-seq data from Italian, British, Finish, and Yoruban populations. As expected, genome-wide estimates of sequence and expression differentiation each independently recapitulate the known demographic history of these four human populations, highlighting the utility of our statistic for identifying genic targets of population-specific adaptations. Application of our statistic reveals that genes containing large copy number variations (CNVs) have elevated levels of population-specific sequence and expression differentiation, consistent with the hypothesis that gene turnover is a key reservoir of adaptive variation. Further, European genes displaying population-specific sequence and expression differentiation are enriched for functions related to epigenetic regulation, immunity, and reproduction. Together, our findings illustrate that population-specific sequence and expression differentiation in humans may preferentially target genes with CNVs and play important roles in a diversity of adaptive and disease-related phenotypes.","UBR5 is an E3-ubiquitin-ligase positively associated with anabolism, hypertrophy and recovery from atrophy in skeletal muscle. The precise mechanisms underpinning UBR5\u2019s role in the regulation of skeletal muscle mass remain unknown. The present study aimed to elucidate these mechanisms by silencing the UBR5 gene in-vitro and in-vivo. The siRNA-induced reduction (\u221277%) in UBR5 gene expression in human myotubes was prevented by mechanical loading, suggesting that UBR5 gene expression may be regulated via mechano-transduction signalling. Therefore, we electroporated a UBR5-RNAi plasmid into mouse tibialis anterior muscle in-vivo to investigate the impact of reduced UBR5 on mechano-transduction signalling MEK/ERK/p90RSK and Akt/p70S6K/4E-BP1/rpS6 pathways. Seven days post UBR5 RNAi electroporation, while reductions in overall muscle mass were not detected, mean CSA of GFP-positive fibers was reduced (\u22129.5%) and the number of large fibers was lower versus the control. Importantly, UBR5-RNAi significantly reduced total RNA, muscle protein synthesis, ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation. Whilst p90RSK phosphorylation significantly increased, total p90RSK protein levels demonstrated a 45% reduction with UBR5-RNAi. Finally, these early signalling events after 7 days of UBR5 knockdown culminated in significant reductions in muscle mass (\u22124.6%) and larger reductions in fiber CSA (\u221218.5%) after 30 days. This was associated with increased levels of the phosphatase, PP2Ac, and inappropriate chronic elevation of p70S6K and rpS6 between 7 and 30 days, and corresponding reductions in eIF4e. This study demonstrates UBR5 plays an important role in anabolism/hypertrophy, whereby knockdown of UBR5 culminates in skeletal muscle atrophy.","The strong connection between undernutrition and gut microbiota (GM) has enabled microbiota-targeting to become an evolving strategy, which witnessed urgent need for fortified formula of supplementary food in undernutrition therapy. Using undernourished pigs as models, we investigated how corn- and millet-based nutritional supplement acted differently in modulating microbiota. Undernourished pigs at age of 9 weeks were fed with pure maize diet (Maize), corn-based (CSB+) and millet-based (MSB+) supplementary food for 3 weeks. Compared with Maize group, both CSB+ and MSB+ improved serum total protein and globulin level, but no physiological improvement was observed by short-term food intervention. MSB+ shown superior influence on GM immaturity which were more normally-grown like at both structural and functional level. Higher level of Bacteriodetes, Firmicutes and lower level of Preteobacteria were detected in MSB+ fed piglets in contrast with CSB+. Lachnospira.spp was significantly raised after nutritional intervention, indicating high correlation with the undernutrition-associated phenotype. Thus, especially from the GM aspect, millet could be one promising source to help undernourished children reconstruct balanced microbiota in short therapeutic term.","Purpose To investigate the relationship between serum HDL-C and spinal bone mineral density (BMD) under different serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25 (OH) D) levels in adults over 40 years old and to explore its mechanism.","Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are diseases of abnormal hematopoietic differentiation with aberrant epigenetic alterations. Azacitidine (AZA) is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) widely used to treat MDS and AML, yet the impact of AZA on the cell surface proteome has not been defined. To identify potential therapeutic targets for use in combination with AZA in AML patients, we investigated the effects of AZA treatment on four AML cell lines (KG1a, HL60, HNT34, and AML193), representing different stages of differentiation. The effect of AZA treatment on these cell lines was characterized at three levels: the DNA methylome (methylation array), the transcriptome (gene expression array), and the cell surface proteome (glycoprotein capture with SILAC labeling). Untreated AML cell lines showed substantial overlap in their methylomes, transcriptomes, and cell surface proteomes. AZA treatment globally reduced DNA methylation in all cell lines, but changes in the transcriptome and surface proteome were subtle and differed among the cell lines. Transcriptome analysis identified five commonly up-regulated coding genes upon AZA treatment in all four cell lines, TRPM4 being the only gene encoding a surface protein, and surface proteomics analysis found no commonly regulated proteins. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of differentially-regulated RNA and surface proteins showed a decrease in metabolism pathways and an increase in immune defense response pathways. As such, AZA treatment in four AML cell lines had diverse effects at the individual gene and protein level, but converged to regulation of metabolism and immune response at the pathway level. Given the heterogeneous response of AZA in the four cell lines at the gene and protein level, we discuss potential therapeutic strategies for combinations with AZA.","Pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived organoids are emerging as novel human-based microphysiological models but display immature phenotypes with limited subsets of endothelial or stromal cells. Here we demonstrate that in vitro manipulation of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in PSC-derived liver organoids selected either through computational analysis or targeted tissue design can advance tissue maturation in vitro. Through an unbiased comparison with the genetic signature of mature livers, we identify downregulated GRNs in fetal liver organoids compared to adult livers. We demonstrate that overexpression of PROX1 and ATF5, together with targeted CRISPR-based transcriptional activation of endogenous CYP3A4, drives maturation in vitro. Single cell analyses reveal hepatobiliary-, endothelial-, and stellate-like cell populations. The engineered organoids demonstrate enhanced vasculogenesis, capture native liver characteristics (e.g. FXR signaling, CYP3A4 activity), and exhibit therapeutic potential in mice. Collectively, our approach provides a genetically guided framework for engineering developmentally advanced multilineage tissues from hiPSCs.","Background and Purpose Immunosuppression is the predominant cause of mortality for sepsis due to failure to eradicate invading pathogens. Unfortunately, no effective and specific drugs capable of reversing immunosuppression are available for clinical use. Increasing evidence implicates vitamin D receptor (VDR) involved in sepsis-induced immunosuppression. Herein, artesunate (AS) was discovered to reverse sepsis-induced immunosuppression and its molecular mechanism is investigated.","Ceramides and dihydroceramides are sphingolipids that present in abundance at the cellular membrane of eukaryotes. Although their metabolic dysregulation has been implicated in many diseases, our knowledge about circulating ceramide changes during the pregnancy remains limited. In this study, we present the development and validation of a high-throughput liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (LC/MS/MS) method for simultaneous quantification of 16 ceramides and 10 dihydroceramides in human serum within 5 mins by using stable isotope-labeled ceramides as internal standards (ISs). This method employs a protein precipitation method for high throughput sample preparation, reverse phase isocratic elusion for chromatographic separation, and Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) for mass spectrometric detection. To qualify for clinical applications, our assay was validated against the FDA guidelines: the Lower Limit of Quantitation (LLOQ as low as 1 nM), linearity (R2&gt;0.99), precision (Coefficient of Variation&lt;15%), accuracy (Percent Error&lt;15%), extraction recovery (&gt;90%), stability (&gt;85%), and carryover (&lt;0.1%). With enhanced sensitivity and specificity from this method, we have, for the first time, determined the serological levels of ceramides and dihydroceramides to reveal unique temporal gestational patterns. Our approach could have value in providing insights into disorders of pregnancy.","Aberrant ocular blood vessel growth can underpin vision loss in leading causes of blindness, including neovascular age-related macular degeneration, retinopathy of prematurity and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Current pharmacological interventions require repeated invasive administrations, lack efficacy in some patients and are associated with poor patient compliance and tachyphylaxis. Small molecule vitamin D has de novo pro-differentiative, anti-proliferative, immunomodulatory, pro-apoptotic and anti-angiogenic properties. Here, our aim was to validate the anti-angiogenic activity of the biologically active form of vitamin D, calcitriol, and a selected vitamin D analogue, 22-oxacalcitriol, across a range of ocular angiogenesis models.","Heterotopic ossification (HO), either acquired or hereditary, is featured by ectopic bone formation outside of the normal skeleton. The acquired form of HO is a debilitating and common complication of musculoskeletal trauma, central nervous system injury, burns, combat trauma, hip and elbow fractures, and total joint replacement surgeries. It can be characterized as abnormal bone formation that occurs mostly by endochondral ossification. Recent studies have implicated inflammation and dysregulation of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling as major early contributors to HO formation. Here, we demonstrate that administration of the Hh pathway inhibitor, arsenic trioxide (ATO), prevented acquired HO in a clinically-relevant trauma/burn mouse model. We further evaluated the effects of two additional Hh pathway antagonists: cholecalciferol and pravastatin on mitigating osteoblast differentiation. Finally, we assessed the effect of a combination of Hh pathway inhibitors on reducing systemic proinflammatory responses. A targeted combination approach using Hh pathway inhibitors may offer potential therapeutic benefits though targeting differential components of the Hh pathway. Taken together, our study demonstrates that the administration of single or multiple Hh pathway inhibitors may have the potential to reduce the formation of acquired HO.","Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram-negative opportunistic human pathogen that is highly prevalent in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). A major problem in treating CF patients infected with P. aeruginosa is the development of antibiotic resistance. Therefore, the identification of novel P. aeruginosa antibiotic drug targets is of the upmost urgency. The genome of P. aeruginosa contains four putative cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) of unknown function that have never before been characterized. Analogous to some of the CYPs from M. tuberculosis, the P. aeruginosa CYPs may be important for growth and colonization of the CF patient\u2019s lung. In this study, we cloned, expressed, and characterized CYP168A1 from P. aeruginosa and identified it as a sub-terminal fatty acid hydroxylase. Spectral binding data and computational modeling of substrates and inhibitors suggest that CYP168A1 has a large, expansive active site preferring long chain fatty acids and large hydrophobic inhibitors. Furthermore, metabolism experiments confirm that the enzyme is capable of hydroxylating arachidonic acid, an important inflammatory signaling molecule present in abundance in the CF lung, to 19-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (19-HETE; Km = 41.1 \u00b5M, Vmax = 222 pmol/min/nmol P450), a potent vasoconstrictor which may play a role in the pathogen\u2019s ability to colonize the mammalian lung. Metabolism of arachidonic acid is subject to substrate inhibition and is also inhibited by the presence of ketoconazole. This study points to the discovery of a new potential drug target that may be of utility in treating drug resistant P. aeruginosa.","Mycobacterium tuberculosis(Mtb) lipoproteins are known to facilitate bacterial survival by manipulating the host immune responses. Here, we have characterized a novel Mtb lipoprotein LprE(LprEMtb), and demonstrated its role in mycobacterial survival. LprEMtb acts by down-regulating the expression of cathelicidin, Cyp27B1, VDR and p38-MAPK via TLR-2 signaling pathway. Deletion of lprEMtb resulted in induction of cathelicidin and decreased survival in the host. Interestingly, LprEMtb was also found to inhibit autophagy mechanism to dampen host immune response. Episomal expression of LprEMtb in non-pathogenic Mycobacterium smegmatis(Msm) increased bacillary persistence by down-regulating the expression of cathelicidin and autophagy, while deletion of LprEMtb orthologue in Msm, had no effect on cathelicidin and autophagy expression. Moreover, LprEMtb blocked phago-lysosome fusion by suppressing the expression of EEA1, Rab7 and LAMP-1 endosomal markers by down-regulating IL-12 and IL-22 cytokines. Our results indicate that LprEMtb plays an important role in mycobacterial pathogenesis in the context of innate immunity.","New approaches to complement vaccination are needed to combat the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and stop COVID-19 related deaths and long-term medical complications. Human beta defensin 2 (hBD-2) is a naturally occurring epithelial cell derived host defense peptide that has antiviral properties. Our comprehensive in-silico studies demonstrate that hBD-2 binds the site on the CoV-2-RBD that docks with the ACE2 receptor. Biophysical and biochemical assays confirm that hBD-2 indeed binds to the CoV-2-receptor binding domain (RBD) (KD \u223c 300 nM), preventing it from binding to ACE2 expressing cells. Importantly, hBD-2 shows specificity by blocking CoV-2/spike pseudoviral infection, but not VSV-G mediated infection, of ACE2 expressing human cells with an IC50 of 2.4\u00b1 0.1 \u03bcM. These promising findings offer opportunities to develop hBD-2 and/or its derivatives and mimetics to safely and effectively use as novel agents to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Skin allo- and xenotransplantation are the standard treatment for major burns when donor sites for autografts are not available and have been shown to significantly accelerate wound healing. Although the cellular elements of foreign grafts are rejected, the extracellular matrix components integrate into the wound and may underlie their beneficial effects on wound healing. The molecular mechanisms defining the relationship between the immune response to foreign grafts and their impact on wound healing have not been fully elucidated. Here, we investigated changes in collagen architecture after xenogeneic implantation of clinically available human biologic scaffolds. We show that collagen deposition in response to the implantation of human split-thickness skin grafts (hSTSG) containing live cells recapitulates normal skin architecture, whereas human acellular dermal matrix (ADM) grafts led to highly aligned collagen deposition, characteristic of fibrosis and scar. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing, we show that macrophage differentiation in response to hSTSG is driven by vitamin D (VD) signaling toward Trem2+ subpopulations with an enrichment of pro-angiogenic and anti-fibrotic transcriptomic programs. We subsequently induced this regenerative subpopulation in vitro by treating bone marrow-derived cells with vitamin D3 and found that hydrogel delivery of Trem2+ macrophages significantly accelerated wound closure in a human-like murine excisional wound model. Our study identifies the preclinical therapeutic potential of Trem2+ macrophages to mitigate fibrosis and promote wound healing and provides a novel effective strategy to develop advanced cell therapies for complex wounds.","Nematodes play key roles in marine ecosystem. Although oceans cover 71% of the Earth\u2019s surface, none of marine model nematode has been reported. Here, we constructed the first inbred line of free-living marine nematode Litoditis marina, sequenced and assembled its genome. Furthermore, we successfully applied CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in L. marina. Comparative genomics revealed that immunity and oxygen regulation genes are expanded, which is probably central to its sediment adaptation. While L. marina exhibits massive gene contractions in NHRs, chemoreceptors, xenobiotics detoxification and core histones, which could explain the more defined marine environment. Our experiments showed that dozens of H4 genes in Caenorhabditis elegans might contribute to its adaptation to the complex terrestrial environments, while two H4 genes in L. marina are involved in salinity stress adaptation. Additionally, ninety-two conserved genes appear to be positively selected in L. marina, which may underpin its osmotic, neuronal and epigenetic changes in the sea. With short generation time, highly inbred lines, and genomic resources, our report brings L. marina a promising marine animal model, and a unique satellite marine model to the well-known biomedical model nematode C. elegans. This study will underpin ongoing work on animal functional genomics, environmental adaptation and developmental evolution.","Accurate measurement of the biological markers of the aging process could provide an \u201caging clock\u201d measuring predicted longevity and allow for the quantification of the effects of specific lifestyle choices on healthy aging. Using modern machine learning techniques, we demonstrate that chronological age can be predicted accurately from (a) the expression level of human genes in capillary blood, and (b) the expression level of microbial genes in stool samples. The latter uses the largest existing metatranscriptomic dataset, stool samples from 90,303 individuals, and is the highest-performing gut microbiome-based aging model reported to date. Our analysis suggests associations between biological age and lifestyle/health factors, e.g., people on a paleo diet or with IBS tend to be biologically older, and people on a vegetarian diet tend to be biologically younger. We delineate the key pathways of systems-level biological decline based on the age-specific features of our model; targeting these mechanisms can aid in development of new anti-aging therapeutic strategies.","The aim of this study was to identify sterols, oxysterols and any down-stream metabolites in placenta, umbilical cord blood plasma, maternal plasma and amniotic fluid to enhance our knowledge of the involvement of these molecules in pregnancy. We confirm the identification of 20S- hydroxycholesterol in human placenta, previously reported in a single publication, and propose a pathway from 22R-hydroxycholesterol to a C27 bile acid of probable structure 3\u03b2,20R,22R- trihydroxycholest-5-en-(25R)26-oic acid. The pathway is evident not only in placenta, but pathway intermediates are also found in umbilical cord plasma, maternal plasma and amniotic fluid but not non-pregnant women.","Intravenous leiomyomatosis (IVLM) is a rare benign smooth muscle tumour that is characterised by intravenous growth in the uterine and pelvic veins. Previous DNA copy number and transcriptomic studies have shown that IVLM harbours unique genomic and transcriptomic alterations when compared to uterine leiomyoma (uLM), which may account for their distinct clinical behaviour. Here we undertake the first comparative proteomic analysis of IVLM and other smooth muscle tumours (comprising uLM, soft tissue leiomyoma and benign metastasising leiomyoma) utilising data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry. We show that, at the protein level, IVLM is defined by the unique co-regulated expression of splicing factors. In particular, IVLM is enriched in two clusters composed of co-regulated proteins from the hnRNP, LSm, SR and Sm classes of the spliceosome complex. One of these clusters (Cluster 3) is associated with key biological processes including nascent protein translocation and cell signalling by small GTPases. Taken together, our study provides evidence of co-regulated expression of splicing factors in IVLM compared to other smooth muscle tumours which suggests a possible role for alternative splicing in the pathogenesis of IVLM.","We previously reported xanthohumol (XN), and its synthetic derivative tetrahydro-XN (TXN) attenuates high-fat diet (HFD) induced obesity and metabolic syndrome in C57BL/6J mice. The objective of the current study was to determine the effect of XN and TXN on lipid accumulation in the liver. Non-supplemented mice were unable to adapt their caloric intake to 60% HFD, resulting in obesity and hepatic steatosis; however, TXN reduced weight gain and decreased hepatic steatosis. Liver transcriptomics indicated TXN might antagonize lipogenic PPAR\u03b3 actions in vivo. XN and TXN inhibited rosiglitazone-induced 3T3-L1 cell differentiation concomitant with decreased expression of lipogenesis-related genes. A PPAR\u03b3 competitive binding assay showed XN and TXN bind to PPAR\u03b3 with an IC50 similar to pioglitazone and 8-10 times stronger than oleate. Molecular docking simulations demonstrated XN and TXN bind in the PPAR\u03b3 ligand-binding domain pocket. Our findings are consistent with XN and TXN acting as antagonists of PPAR\u03b3.","Congenital birth defects due to mutations of enzymes involved cholesterol synthesis, like Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) and Lathosterolosis are characterized by an accumulation of cholesterol precursors. The phenotype of both SLOS and Lathosterolosis have similarities to syndromes associated with abnormal Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling, consistent with the observation that cholesterol precursors and their derivative can inhibit Shh signaling. Two types of multipass membrane proteins play central roles in Shh signal transduction, the putative Resistance, Nodulation and Division (RND) antiporters Patched (Ptch)1 and \u22122, and the G-protein coupled receptor Smoothened (Smo). Sterols have been suggested as cargo for Ptch1/2, while Smo activity can affected both positively and negatively by steroidal molecules. We demonstrate that embryonic stem cells with mutations in the 7-dehydroxycholesterol reductase (7Dhcr) or sterol-C5-desaturase (Sc5d) gene reduce the Hh response in adjacent wildtype cells when grown in mosaic organoids. This non-cell autonomous inhibitory activity of the mutant cells requires the presence of both Ptch1 and Ptch2. These observations support a model in which late cholesterol precursors that accumulate in cells lacking 7Dhcr are the cargo for Ptch1 and Ptch2 efflux activity and mediate the non-cell autonomous inhibition of Smo.","Bile acids (BAs) comprise heterogenous amphipathic cholesterol-derived molecules that carry out physicochemical and signaling functions. A major site of BA action is the terminal ileum, where enterocytes actively reuptake BAs and express high levels of BA-sensitive nuclear receptors. BA pool size and composition are affected by changes in metabolic health, and vice versa. One of several factors that differentiate BAs is the presence of a hydroxyl group on C12 of the steroid ring. 12a-hydroxylated BAs (12HBAs) are altered in multiple disease settings, but the consequences of 12HBA abundance are incompletely understood. We employed mouse primary ileum organoids to investigate the transcriptional effects of varying 12HBA abundance in BA pools. We identified Slc30a10 as one of the top genes differentially induced by BA pools with varying 12HBA abundance. SLC30A10 is a manganese (Mn) efflux transporter critical for whole-body manganese excretion. We found that BA pools, especially those low in 12HBAs, induce cellular manganese efflux, and that Slc30a10 induction by BA pools is driven primarily by lithocholic acid signaling via the vitamin D receptor. Administration of lithocholic acid or a vitamin D receptor agonist resulted in increased Slc30a10 expression in mouse ileum epithelia. These data demonstrate a previously unknown role for BAs in intestinal control of Mn homeostasis.","Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is an inherited retinal disease, affecting &gt;20 million people worldwide. Loss of daylight vision typically occurs due to the dysfunction/loss of cone photoreceptors, the cell type that initiates our color and high acuity vision. Currently, there is no effective treatment for RP, other than gene therapy for a limited number of specific disease genes. To develop a gene-agnostic therapy, we screened \u224820 genes for their ability to prolong cone photoreceptor survival in vivo. Here, we report an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector expressing Txnip, which prolongs the survival of cone photoreceptors and improves visual acuity in RP mouse models. A Txnip allele, C247S, which blocks the association of Txnip with thioredoxin, provides an even greater benefit. Additionally, the rescue effect of Txnip depends on lactate dehydrogenase b (Ldhb), and correlates with the presence of healthier mitochondria, suggesting that Txnip saves RP cones by enhancing their lactate catabolism.","Recently, dual RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) has been identified as a powerful tool to study host-pathogen interactions, which is particularly interesting for intracellular pathogens such as mycobacteria. However, due to the complexity of obtaining human host cells, many models rely on the usage of host cells derived from animals or cell lines, which does not accurately mimic the situation in the patient. Furthermore, due to the severe disbalance in host and pathogen RNA content, it is difficult to obtain sufficient sequencing depth for the infecting pathogen. Here, we present an optimized method to perform dual RNA-sequencing on human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDMs) infected with Mycobacterium avium (M. avium). It is likely that, with slight modifications in multiplicity of infection (MOI) to account for differences in virulence, this methodology will be applicable for other difficult-to-lyse intracellular mycobacteria.","The microbial communities that inhabit the distal gut of humans and other mammals exhibit large inter-individual variation. While host genetics is a known factor that influences gut microbiota composition, the mechanisms underlying this variation remain largely unknown. Bile acids (BAs) are hormones that are produced by the host and chemically modified by gut bacteria. BAs serve as environmental cues and nutrients to microbes, but they can also have antibacterial effects. We hypothesized that host genetic variation in BA metabolism and homeostasis influence gut microbiota composition. To address this, we used the Diversity Outbred (DO) stock, a population of genetically distinct mice derived from eight founder strains. We characterized the fecal microbiota composition and plasma and cecal BA profiles from 400 DO mice maintained on a high-fat high-sucrose diet for \u223c22 weeks. Using quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis, we identified several genomic regions associated with variations in both bacterial and BA profiles. Notably, we found overlapping QTL for Turicibacter sp. and plasma cholic acid, which mapped to a locus containing the gene for the ileal bile acid transporter, Slc10a2. Mediation analysis and subsequent follow-up validation experiments suggest that differences in Slc10a2 gene expression associated with the different strains influences levels of both traits and revealed novel interactions between Turicibacter and BAs. This work illustrates how systems genetics can be utilized to generate testable hypotheses and provide insight into host-microbe interactions.","Since cell penetrating peptides are promising tools for delivery of cargo into cells, factors limiting or facilitating their cellular uptake are intensely studied. Using labeling with pH-insensitive and pH-sensitive dyes we report that escape of penetratin from acidic endo-lysosomal compartments is retarded compared to its cellular uptake. The membrane dipole potential, known to alter transmembrane transport of charged molecules, is shown to be negatively correlated with the concentration of penetratin in the cytoplasmic compartment. Treatment of cells with therapeutically relevant concentrations of atorvastatin, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis, significantly increased the release of penetratin from acidic endocytic compartments in two different cell types. This effect of atorvastatin correlated with its ability to decrease the membrane dipole potential. These results highlight the importance of the dipole potential in regulating cellular uptake of cell penetrating peptides and suggest a clinically relevant way of boosting this process.","Developmental control of jaw length is critical for survival. The jaw skeleton arises from neural crest mesenchyme and previously we demonstrated that these progenitors upregulate bone-resorbing enzymes including Matrix metalloproteinase 13 (Mmp13) when generating short quail beaks versus long duck bills. Inhibiting bone resorption or Mmp13 increases jaw length. Here, we uncover mechanisms establishing species-specific levels of Mmp13 and bone resorption. Quail show greater activation of, and sensitivity to Transforming Growth Factor-Beta (TGF\u03b2) signaling than duck; where mediators like SMADs and targets like Runx2, which bind Mmp13, become elevated. Inhibiting TGF\u03b2 signaling decreases bone resorption. We discover a SMAD binding element in the quail Mmp13 promoter not found in duck and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near a RUNX2 binding element that affect expression. Switching the SNPs and SMAD site abolishes TGF\u03b2-sensitivity in the quail Mmp13 promoter but makes duck responsive. Thus, differential regulation of TGF\u03b2 signaling and Mmp13 promoter structure underlie avian jaw development and evolution.","Vitamin-D receptor (VDR) mRNA is enriched in malignant lung, ovarian and pancreatic tissues and showed poor prognoses. Calcitriol and stable or CRISPR-directed VDR upregulation increased PD-L1mRNA and protein expression in cancer cells in-vitro. A ChIP assay showed the binding of VDR with VDREPD-L1. Stattic, a STAT3 phosphorylation inhibitor blocked calcitriol or VDR overexpression induced PD-L1 upregulation. MeTC7, a VDR antagonist developed by us, reduced PD-L1 expression on macrophages, ovarian, lung, breast, and pancreatic cancer cells in-vitro. In radiotherapy inducible PD-L1 model of orthotopic MC38 murine colon cancer, MeTC7 decreased PD-L1 surface expression, suppressed inflammatory monocytes (IMs) population and increased intra-tumoral CD69+PD1+CD8+T-cells. Intriguingly, MeTC7 reduced TH-MYCN transgenic neuroblastoma tumor growth without affecting PD-L1 and tumor immune milieu. In summary, Vitamin-D/VDR drives PD-L1 expression on cancer cells via STAT-3. Inhibiting VDR exhibited anti-checkpoint effects in orthotopic colon tumors, whereas PDL1-independent and anti-VDR/MYCN effects controlled growth of transgenic neuroblastoma and xenografted tumors.","Hemolysis is a pathological component of many diseases and is associated with thrombosis and vascular dysfunction. Hemolytic products, including cell-free hemoglobin and free heme directly activate platelets. However, the effect of hemolysis on platelet degranulation, a central process in not only thrombosis, but also inflammatory and mitogenic signaling, remains less clear. Our group showed that hemoglobin-induced platelet activation involved the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS). However, the molecular mechanism by which extracellular hemolysis induces platelet mtROS production, and whether the mtROS regulate platelet degranulation remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate using isolated human platelets that cell free heme is a more potent agonist for platelet activation than hemoglobin, and stimulates the release of a specific set of molecules from the \u03b1-granule of platelets, including the glycoprotein thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1). We uncover the mechanism of heme-mediated platelet mtROS production which is dependent on the activation of platelet TLR4 signaling and leads to the downstream phosphorylation of complex-V by the serine kinase Akt. Notably, inhibition of platelet TLR4 or Akt, or scavenging mtROS prevents heme-induced granule release in vitro. Further, heme-dependent granule release is significantly attenuated in vivo in mice lacking TLR4 or those treated with the mtROS scavenger MitoTEMPO. These data elucidate a novel mechanism of TLR4-mediated mitochondrial regulation, establish the mechanistic link between hemolysis and platelet degranulation, and begin to define the heme and mtROS-dependent platelet secretome. These data have implications for hemolysis-induced thrombo-inflammatory signaling and for the consideration of platelet mitochondria as a therapeutic target in hemolytic disorders.","We constructed a lung cancer-specific database housing expression data and clinical data from over 6,700 patients in 56 studies. Expression data from 23 \u201cwhole-genome\u201d based platforms were carefully processed and quality controlled, whereas clinical data were standardized and rigorously curated. Empowered by this lung cancer database, we created an open access web resource \u2013 the Lung Cancer Explorer (LCE), which enables researchers and clinicians to explore these data and perform analyses. Users can perform meta-analyses on LCE to gain a quick overview of the results on tumor vs normal differential gene expression and expression-survival association. Individual dataset-based survival analysis, comparative analysis, and correlation analysis are also provided with flexible options to allow for customized analyses from the user.","Humic substances are well known human nutritional supplement materials and play important performance-enhancing roles as animal feed additives, too. For decades, ingredients of humic substances have also been proven to carry potent antiviral effects against different viruses. Here, the antiviral activity of a humic substance containing ascorbic acid, Se- and Zn2+ ions intended as a nutritional supplement material was investigated against SARS-CoV-2 virus B1.1.7 Variant of Concern (\u201cAlpha Variant\u201d) in a VeroE6 cell line. Results show that this combination has a significant in vitro antiviral effect at a very low concentration range of its intended active ingredients. Even picomolar concentration ranges of humic substances, vitamin C and Zn/Se ions in the given composition were enough to achieve fifty percent viral replication inhibition in the applied SARS-CoV-2 virus inhibition test.","A significant genetic suspect for coronary artery disease is the pathological adaptation of apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) through intramolecular interaction. With the prevailing evidences on APOE4 genotype and its prevalence in coronary artery disease, the present study has investigated the protein\u2013ligand binding affinity and unveil the receptor binding abilities of different classes of ligands for APOE4 through molecular docking studies. Structural basis of APOE4 involvement in CAD suggests that the intramolecular domain interactions to be a suitable target for therapeutic intervention. Various classes of ligands including known drugs used in the treatment of CAD, fragment-based stabilizers and their similar structures and molecules with known bioactivity against APOE4 were screened for their binding affinity and further investigated for their interactions with APOE4. Computational studies show the benzyl amide derived structures to be useful candidates in modulation of APOE4. The dynamics of the binding analysis can be further achieved with an in-depth understanding of drug-receptor interactions performing molecular dynamic simulation studies.","Emerging evidence has indicated that microbial transmission from the bovine dam to her fetus may take place before birth, and that the maternal microbiota during pregnancy modulates programming of fetal metabolic and nervous system development, highlighting the potential and extended role of the maternal microbiome in calf health and development. In the present study, we characterized the nasopharyngeal, ruminal and vaginal microbiota from two cohorts of beef heifers managed at the same location: 1) virgin yearling heifers (9 months old) born from dams received gestational diets which resulted in low (LG, n = 22) or medium (MG, n = 23) weight gain during the first 84 days of gestation; and 2) pregnant replacement heifers that received a vitamin and mineral supplement (VTM, n = 17) or not (Control, n = 15) during the first 6 months of gestation. Nasopharyngeal and vaginal swabs as well as ruminal fluid were collected from both cohorts and the microbiota of each sample was assessed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. In addition to the comparison between treatment groups within each cohort, the similarity of the microbiota of the three sample types were evaluated, and shared taxa amongst these communities were identified. The bacterial genera present in the rumen and vagina that can influence methanogenic archaeal genera were predicted using a stepwise-selected generalized linear mixed model. No significant difference was observed in the alpha and beta diversity in any of the nasopharyngeal, ruminal and vaginal microbiota between LG and MG offspring virgin heifers, or between the control and VTM pregnant heifers (p &gt; 0.05). Subtle compositional changes in the vaginal microbiota in yearling heifers, and in the nasopharyngeal and ruminal microbiota of pregnant heifers were detected in response to treatments. Forty-one archaeal and bacterial OTUs were shared by over 60% of all samples from both virgin and pregnant heifers. Two taxa within the Methanobrevibacter genus were identified as core taxa and this genus was more relatively abundant in pregnant heifers compared to virgin heifers. Among the 25 top genera, Prevotella and Prevotella UCG-003 (negative) and Christensenellaceae R-7 group (positive) were predicted to have a significant effect on ruminal Methanobrevibacter spp. The results of this study indicate that there is little impact of divergent gestational nutrition during the first trimester on the calf microbiome at 9 months postnatal, and that VTM supplementation during pregnancy may not alter the maternal microbiome. This study provides evidence that there are several microbial taxa, including methanogenic archaea, that are shared across the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and reproductive tracts, suggesting the need for a holistic evaluation of the bovine microbiota when considering potential maternal sources for seeding calves with pioneer microbiota.","Background MC1R, a G-protein coupled receptor with high affinity for alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (\u03b1MSH), modulates pigment production in melanocytes from many species and is associated with human melanoma risk. MC1R mutations affecting human skin and hair color also have pleiotropic effects on the immune response and analgesia. Variants affecting human pigmentation in utero alter the congenital phenotype of both oculocutaneous albinism and congenital melanocytic naevi, and have a possible effect on birthweight.","Protein engineering through directed evolution is an effective way to obtain proteins with novel functions with the potential applications as tools for diagnosis or therapeutics. Many natural proteins, largely antibodies as well as some non-antibody proteins, have undergone directed evolution in vitro in the test tubes in the laboratories around the world, resulted in the numerous protein variants with novel or enhanced functions. In this study, we constructed a Fyn SH2 variant library by randomizing the 8 variable residues in its phosphotyrosine (pTyr) binding pocket. Selection of this library by a pTyr peptide from MidT antigen led to the identification of SH2 variants with enhanced affinities to the peptide, compared to the wild type SH2, by EC50 assay. Fluorescent polarization (FP) was then applied to quantify the binding affinity of the newly identified SH2 variants. As a result, three SH2 variants, named V3, V13 and V24, have comparable binding affinities with the previously identified SH2 triple-mutant superbinder (refer to Trm). Biolayer Interferometry (BLI) assay was employed to disclose the kinetics of the binding of these SH2 superbinders, in addition to the wild type SH2, to the phosphotyrosine peptide. The results indicated that all the SH2 superbinders have two-orders increase of the dissociation rate when binding the pTyr peptide while there was no significant change in their associate rates. The previously identified SH2 superbinder Trm as well as the V13 and V24 discovered in this study have cross-reactivity with the sulfotyrosine (sTyr) containing peptide while the wild type SH2 does not. Intriguingly, though binding the pTyr peptide with comparable affinity with other SH2 superbinders, the V3 does not bind to the sTyr peptide, implying it binds to the pTyr peptide with a different pattern from the other superbinders. The newly identified superbinders could be utilized as tools for the identification of pTyr-containing proteins from tissues under different physiological or pathophysiological conditions and may have the potential in the therapeutics.","Plasma biochemistry and hematology reference intervals are integral health assessment tools in all medical fields, including aquatic animal health. As sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) are becoming aquaculturally and economically more important, this manuscript provides essential reference intervals (RI) for their plasma biochemistry and hematology along with reference photomicrographs of blood cells in healthy, fasted sablefish. Blood cell morphology can differ between fish species. In addition, blood cell counts and blood chemistry can vary between fish species, demographics, water conditions, seasons, diets, and culture systems, which precludes the use of RI\u2019s from other fish species. For this study, blood was collected for plasma biochemistry and hematology analysis between June 20 and July 18, 2019, from healthy, yearling sablefish, hatched and reared in captivity on a commercial diet. Overnight fast of 16-18 hours did not sufficiently reduce lipids in the blood, which led to visible lipemia and frequent rupture of blood cells during analysis. Therefore, sablefish should be fasted for 24 to 36 hours before blood is collected to reduce hematology artifacts or possible reagent interference in plasma biochemistry analysis. Lymphocytes were the most dominant leukocytes (98%), while eosinophils were rare, and basophils were not detected in sablefish. Neutrophils were very large cells with D\u00f6hle bodies. In mammals and avian species, D\u00f6hle bodies are usually signs of toxic change from inflammation, but no such association was found in these fish. In conclusion, lipemia can interfere with sablefish blood analysis, and available removal methods should be evaluated as fasting for up to 36 h might not always be feasible. Also, more studies are required to establish RI for different developmental stages and rearing conditions.","PIK3CA mutations are the most common in breast cancer, particularly in the estrogen receptor positive cohort, but the benefit of PI3K inhibitors has had limited success compared with approaches targeting other less common mutations. We found allelic imbalances in the expression of PIK3CA in normal breast tissue and mapped a germline candidate regulatory variant. An imbalance was also frequently observed in the expression of the missense mutant and wild-type PIK3CA alleles in breast tumors from METABRIC and TCGA projects. Moreover, although 60% of tumors preferentially expressed the mutant allele, 10% did preferentially express the wild-type allele. Mechanistically, we show that these imbalances are more frequently due to regulatory variants in cis than altered copy-number and predict that somatic variants have a more significant role than germline ones. We further found that imbalanced allelic expression between mutant and wild-type alleles due to cis-regulatory variants associated with poor prognosis (p=0.0081).","Kidney transplant recipients (KTR) are at increased risk of fractures. Total urinary hydroxyproline excretion used to be a marker for bone resorption (BR) but faded into the background when more specific markers like Beta-CrossLaps (CTX) became available. Proteomic studies identified numerous hydroxyproline-containing urinary collagen peptides but their origin remains unknown. We followed the hypothesis that some of the urinary collagen peptides are associated with BR and are markers for pathophysiological changes in bone metabolism of KTR. Clinical and laboratory data including serum levels of CTX in 96 KTR from two French centers (Strasbourg, n=38; Paris-Necker, n=58) were correlated with the signal intensity of urinary peptides identified by capillary electrophoresis (CE) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) and tandem-MS. The effect of oral bisphosphonates on urinary peptides was studied in an independent group of 11 KTR. Eighty-two urinary peptides were identified to be significantly correlated with serum CTX levels in both cohorts. Statistical association with parameters other than BR markers were not significant. Collagen \u03b1-1(I) chain (COL1A1) was the most frequently identified peptide source. COL1A1 peptides associated with BR were significantly more hydroxylated than those showing no association (55.9% versus 45,2%, p&lt;0.0003 by a \u03c72-test). From the 82 urinary peptides correlated to CTX, 17 were significantly associated with bisphosphonate treatment. All of these 17 peptides showed a marked reduction in their excretion levels after 410 \u00b1 344 days of bisphosphonate treatment compared to baseline levels. We studied the cleavage sites of these COL1A1 peptides and observed a signature of Cathepsin K and Matrix Metallopeptidase 9. This study provides strong evidence for the occurrence of collagen peptides in the urine of KTR that are associated with BR and that are sensitive to bisphosphonate treatment. Their assessment might become a valuable tool to monitor bone status in KTR.","Bone fragility is the product of defects in bone mass and bone quality, both of which show sex-specific differences. Despite this, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underpinning the sexually dimorphic control of bone quality remain unclear, limiting our ability to effectively prevent fractures, especially in postmenopausal osteoporosis. Recently, using male mice, we found that systemic or osteocyte-intrinsic inhibition of TGF\u03b2 signaling, achieved using the 9.6-kb DMP1 promoter-driven Cre recombinase (T\u03b2RIIocy\u2212/\u2212 mice), suppresses osteocyte perilacunar/canalicular remodeling (PLR) and compromises bone quality. Since systemic TGF\u03b2 inhibition more robustly increases bone mass in female than male mice, we postulated that sex-specific differences in bone quality could likewise result, in part, from dimorphic regulation of PLR by TGF\u03b2. Moreover, since lactation induces PLR, we examined the effect of TGF\u03b2 inhibition on the female skeleton during lactation. In contrast to males, female mice that possess an osteocyte-intrinsic defect in TGF\u03b2 signaling were protected from TGF\u03b2-dependent defects in PLR and bone quality. The expression of requisite PLR enzymes, the lacuno-canalicular network, and the flexural strength of female T\u03b2RIIocy\u2212/\u2212 bone was intact. With lactation, however, bone loss, and induction in PLR and osteocytic parathyroid hormone type I receptor (PTHR1) expression, were suppressed in T\u03b2RIIocy\u2212/\u2212 bone, relative to wild-type. Indeed, differential control of PTHR1 expression, by TGF\u03b2 and other factors, may contribute to dimorphism in PLR regulation in male and female T\u03b2RIIocy\u2212/\u2212 mice. These findings provide key insights into the sex-based differences in osteocyte PLR that underlie bone quality and highlight TGF\u03b2 signaling as a crucial regulator of lactation-induced PLR.","Bariatric surgeries such as the Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy (VSG) are invasive, but provide the most effective long-term metabolic improvements in obese and Type 2 diabetic patients. These powerful effects of manipulating the gastrointestinal tract point to an important role of gastrointestinal signals in regulating both energy balance and metabolism. To that end, we have used mouse models of VSG to identify key gut signals that mediate these beneficial effects. Preliminary data from our rodent model of VSG led us to hypothesize a potential role for the hormone Fibroblast-Growth Factor15/19 (mouse/human ortholog) which pharmacologically can regulate many aspects of energy homeostasis and glucose handling. FGF15 is expressed in ileal enterocytes of the small intestine and is released postprandially. Like many other gut hormones, postprandial plasma levels in humans and ileal FGF15 expression in mice increase after VSG. We generated intestinal-specific FGF15 knock out (VilCreERT2; Fgf15f/f) mice and controls, which were maintained on 60% high-fat diet. Interestingly, ablation of intestinal FGF15 in adult mice results in little change to body weight or glucose regulation when challenged with a high-fat diet. Unlike what we had predicted, intestinal-specific FGF15 knock out mice lost more weight after VSG and this was a result of increased lean tissue loss compared to control mice. Further, the loss of bone mineral density observed after VSG in control mice was increased in intestinal-specific FGF15 knock out mice. Finally the effect of VSG to reduce hepatic cholesterol was also absent in intestinal-specific FGF15 knock out mice. These data point to an important role for intestinal FGF15 to protect the organism from deleterious effects of rapid weight loss that occurs after VSG.","The inherited brittle bone disease osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is commonly caused by COL1A1 and COL1A2 mutations that disrupt the collagen I triple helix. This causes intracellular endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention of the misfolded collagen and can result in a pathological ER stress response. A therapeutic approach to reduce this toxic mutant load could be to stimulate mutant collagen degradation by manipulating autophagy and/or ER-associated degradation. Since carbamazepine (CBZ) both stimulates autophagy of misfolded collagen X and improves skeletal pathology in a metaphyseal chondrodysplasia model, we tested the effect of CBZ on bone structure and strength in 3 week-old male OI Col1a2 +/p.G610C and control mice. Treatment for 3 or 6 weeks with CBZ, at the dose effective in metaphyseal chondrodysplasia, provided no therapeutic benefit to Col1a2 +/p.G610C mouse bone structure, strength, or composition, measured by micro-computed tomography, three point bending tests and Fourier-transform infrared microspectroscopy. In control mice however, CBZ treatment for 6 weeks impaired femur growth and led to lower femoral cortical and trabecular bone mass. These data, showing the negative impact of CBZ treatment on the developing mouse bones, raise important issues which must be considered in any human clinical applications of CBZ in growing individuals.","Despite a critical role for MYC as an effector of oncogenic RAS, strategies to target MYC activity in RAS-driven cancers are lacking. Oncogenic KRAS is insufficient to drive tumorigenesis, while addition of modest overexpression of MYC drives robust tumor formation, suggesting that mechanisms beyond the RAS pathway play key roles in MYC regulation and RAS-driven tumorigenesis. Here we show that acidic fibroblast growth factor (FGF1) derived from cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) cooperates with cancer cell-autonomous signals to increase MYC level, promoter occupancy, and activity. FGF1 is necessary and sufficient for paracrine regulation of MYC protein stability, signaling through AKT and GSK-3\u03b2. These signals cooperate with, but are distinct from, cell-autonomous signals from oncogenic KRAS which stabilize MYC. Human pancreatic cancer specimens reveal a strong correlation between stromal CAF content and MYC protein level in the neoplastic compartment, and identify CAFs as the specific source of FGF1 in the tumor microenvironment. Together, our findings demonstrate that MYC is coordinately regulated by cell-autonomous and microenvironmental signals, and establish CAF-derived FGF1 as a novel paracrine regulator of oncogenic transcription.","Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is one of the most common causes of dementia and frailty. This study aimed to use bioinformatics analysis to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in AD. The Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing dataset GSE125583 was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and DEGs were identified. After assessment of Gene Ontology (GO) terms and pathway enrichment for DEGs, a protein\u2013protein interaction (PPI) network, module analysis, miRNA-hub gene regulatory network construction and TF-hub gene regulatory network were conducted via comprehensive target prediction and network analyses. Finally, we validated hub genes by receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC). In total, 956 DEGs were identified in the AD samples, including 479 up regulated genes and 477 down regulated genes. Functional enrichment analysis showed that these DEGs are mainly involved in the neuronal system, GPCR ligand binding, regulation of biological quality and cell communication. The hub genes of PAK1, ELAVL2, NSF, HTR2C, TERT, UBD, MKI67, HSPB1, PYHIN1 and TES might be associated with AD. The diagnostic value and expression levels of these hub genes in AD were further confirmed by ROC analysis. In conclusion, we identified pathways and crucial candidate genes that affect the outcomes of patients with AD, and these genes might serve as potential therapeutic targets.","Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) contains a conserved CX3C motif on the ectodomain of the G-protein. The motif has been indicated as facilitating attachment of the virus to the host initiating infection via the human CX3CR1 receptor. The natural CX3CR1 ligand, CX3CL1, has been shown to induce signaling pathways resulting in transcriptional changes in the host cells. We hypothesize that binding of RSV to CX3CR1 via CX3C leads to transcriptional changes in host epithelial cells. Using transcriptomic analysis, the effect of CX3CR1 engagement by RSV was investigated. Normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells were infected with RSV virus containing either wildtype G-protein, or a mutant virus containing a CX4C mutation in the G-protein. RNA sequencing was performed on mock and 4-days-post-infected cultures. NHBE cultures were also treated with purified recombinant wild-type A2 G-protein. Here we report that RSV infection resulted in significant changes in the levels 766 transcripts. Many nuclear associated proteins were upregulated in the WT group, including Nucleolin. Alternatively, cilia-associated genes, including CC2D2A and CFAP221 (PCDP1), were downregulated. The addition of recombinant G-protein to the culture lead to the suppression of cilia-related genes while also inducing Nucleolin. Mutation of the CX3C motif (CX4C) reversed these effects on transcription decreasing nucleolin induction and lessening the suppression of cilia-related transcripts in culture. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining demonstrated decreases in in ciliated cells and altered morphology. Therefore, it appears that engagement of CX3CR1 leads to induction of genes necessary for RSV entry as well as dysregulation of genes associated with cilia function.","Due to an inability to ethically access developing human brain tissue as well as identify prospective cases, early-arising neurodevelopmental and cell-specific signatures of Schizophrenia (Scz) have remained unknown and thus undefined. To overcome these challenges, we utilized Scz patient-derived stem cells to generate 3D cerebral organoids to model neuropathology of Scz during this critical period. We discovered that Scz organoids exhibited ventricular neuropathology resulting in altered progenitor survival and disrupted neurogenesis. This ultimately yielded fewer neurons within developing cortical fields of Scz organoids. Single-cell sequencing revealed that Scz progenitors were specifically depleted of neuronal programming factors leading to a remodeling of cell-lineages, altered differentiation trajectories, and distorted cortical cell-type diversity. While Scz organoids were 99.95% similar in their macromolecular diversity to Ctrls, four GWAS factors (PTN, COMT, PLCL1, and PODXL) and peptide fragments belonging to the POU-domain transcription factor family (e.g. POU3F2/BRN2) were altered. This revealed that Scz organoids principally differed not in their proteomic diversity, but specifically in their total quantity of disease and neurodevelopmental factors at the molecular level. Single-cell sequencing also subsequently identified cell-type specific alterations in neuronal programming factors and growth factors, and specifically replicated the depletion of POU3F2 (BRN2) and PTN in both Scz progenitors and neurons. Consequently, in two mechanistic rescue experiments we identified that the transcription factor POU3F2 (BRN2) and growth factor PTN operate as mechanistic substrates of neurogenesis and cellular survival, respectively, in Scz organoids. This suggests that multiple mechanisms of Scz exist in patient-derived organoids, and that these disparate mechanisms converge upon primordial brain developmental pathways such as neuronal differentiation, survival, and growth factor support, which may amalgamate to elevate intrinsic risk of Scz.","Background Physical activity and sedentary behavior has inconsistent effects on fertility. High body mass index is associated with infertility but to our knowledge, very few studies have explored body composition in association to fertility.","Overweight and obesity are associated with functional and structural alterations in the brain, but how these associations change across critical developmental periods remains unknown. Here, we examined the relationship between age, body mass index (BMI) and cortical thickness (CT) in healthy adolescents (n=70; 14 \u2013 19 y) and adults (n=75; 25 \u2013 45 y). We also examined the relationship between adiposity, impulsivity, measured by delay discounting (DD), and CT of the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), a region key to impulse control. A significant age-by-BMI interaction was observed in both adolescents and adults; however, the direction of this relationship differed between age groups. In adolescents, increased age-adjusted BMI Z-score attenuated age-related thinning globally and in the right superior frontal gyrus. In adults, increased BMI augmented age-related CT reductions, both globally and in bilateral parietal cortex. Although DD was unrelated to adiposity in both groups, increased DD and BMI were both associated with reduced IFG thickness in adults. Our findings suggest that the known age-related changes in CT in adolescence and adulthood are altered by adiposity. The impact of weight on cortical development and its functional implications would suggest that future studies of adolescent and adult brain development take adiposity into account.","Strategies have not been available until recently to uncover interacting protein networks specific to key cell types, their subcellular compartments, and their major regulators during complex in vivo events. Here we apply BioID2 proximity labeling to capture protein networks acting within cardiomyocytes during a key model of innate heart regeneration in zebrafish. Transgenic zebrafish expressing a promiscuous BirA2 localized to the entire myocardial cell or membrane compartment were generated, each identifying unique proteomes in adult cardiomyocytes that became altered during regeneration. BioID2 profiling for interactors with ErbB2, a co-receptor for the cardiomyocyte mitogen Nrg1, implicated Rho A as a target of ErbB2 signaling in cardiomyocytes. Blockade of Rho A during heart regeneration, or during cardiogenic stimulation by the mitogenic influences Nrg1, Vegfaa or Vitamin D, disrupted muscle creation. Our findings reveal proximity labeling as a useful resource to interrogate cell proteomes and signaling networks during tissue regeneration in zebrafish.","Mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein mediates innate antiviral responses, including responses to certain coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). We have previously shown that ultraviolet-A (UVA) therapy can prevent virus-induced cell death in human ciliated tracheal epithelial cells (HTEpC) infected with coronavirus-229E, and that UVA treatment results in an increase in intracellular levels of MAVS. In this study, we set out to determine the mechanisms by which UVA light can activate MAVS, and whether local UVA light application can activate MAVS at locations distant from the light source (such as via cell-to-cell communication). MAVS levels were compared in HTEpC exposed to 2 mW/cm2 narrow band (NB)-UVA for 20 minutes and in unexposed controls, at 30-40% and at 100% confluency. MAVS levels were also compared in unexposed HTEpC treated with supernatants or lysates from UVA-exposed cells or from unexposed controls. Also, MAVS was assessed in different sections of confluent monolayer plates where only one section was exposed to NB-UVA. The results show that UVA increases the expression of MAVS protein. Cells in a confluent monolayer exposed to UVA were able to confer an elevation in MAVS in cells adjacent to the exposed section, and even cells in the most distant sections not exposed to UVA. In this study, human ciliated tracheal epithelial cells exposed to UVA demonstrate increased MAVS protein, and also appear to transmit this influence to distant confluent cells not exposed to light.","Psoriasis is characterized by chronic inflammation, perpetuated by a Th17-dependent signaling loop between the immune system and keratinocytes that could involve phospholipase A2 (PLA2)-dependent eicosanoid release. A prior knowledge network supported by experimental observations was used to encode the regulatory network of psoriatic keratinocytes in a computational model for studying the mode of action of a cytosolic (c) PLA2\u03b1 inhibitor. A combination of evidence derived from the computational model and experimental data suggests that Th17 cytokines stimulate pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in psoriatic keratinocytes via activation of cPLA2\u03b1-PGE2-EP4 signaling, which could be suppressed using the anti-psoriatic calcipotriol. cPLA2\u03b1 inhibition and calcipotriol showed overlapping and distinct modes of action. Model analyses revealed the immunomodulatory role of Th1 cytokines, the modulation of the physiological states of keratinocytes by Th17 cytokines, and how Th1 and Th17 cells together promote the development of psoriasis. Model simulations additionally suggest novel drug targets, including EP4 and PRKACA, for treatment that may restore a normal phenotype. Our work illustrates how the study of complex diseases can benefit from an integrated systems approach.","Nutritional intake impacts the human epigenome by directing epigenetic pathways in normal cell development via as yet unknown molecular mechanisms. Consequently, imbalance in the nutritional intake is able to dysregulate the epigenetic profile and drive cells towards malignant transformation. Herein, we present a novel epigenetic effect of the essential nutrient, NAD. We demonstrate that impairment of DNMT1 enzymatic activity by NAD-promoted ADP-ribosylation, leads to demethylation and transcriptional activation of CEBPA gene, suggesting the existence of an unknown NAD-controlled region within the locus. In addition to the molecular events, NAD treated cells exhibit significant morphological and phenotypical changes that correspond to myeloid differentiation.","The capacity to generate functional hepatocytes from renewable human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) could address limited supplies of primary human hepatocytes. However, hepatocytes differentiated from hPSCs in vitro are functionally immature. To understand mechanisms regulating maturation of in vitro derived hepatocytes, we developed a 3D spheroid differentiation system and compared gene regulatory elements in uncultured human primary hepatocytes with those in hepatocytes that were differentiated in 2D or 3D conditions from human PSCs by RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and H3K27Ac ChIP-seq. Three-dimensional differentiation improved enhancer activity and expression of transcription factor ONECUT1, but was insufficient to upregulate human-specific mature hepatocytes marker gene CYP3A4 or super-enhancer regulated transcription factor gene NFIC. Regulome comparisons showed reduced enrichment of thyroid receptor THRB motifs in accessible chromatin and in active enhancers without reduced transcription of THRB, suggesting the regulation at the level of THRB ligands in PSC-differentiated hepatocytes. Addition of thyroid hormone T3 to the PSC-differentiated hepatocytes increased CYP3A4 expression. T3 increased binding of THRB to the CYP3A4 proximal enhancer and restored the super-enhancer status and gene expression of NFIC and reduced expression of AFP. The resultant hPSC-hepatocytes showed gene expression, epigenetic status and super-enhancer landscape closer to primary hepatocytes and activated regulatory regions including non-coding SNPs associated with liver-related diseases. Transplanting the 3D PSC-hepatocytes into immunocompromised mice resulted in engraftment of human hepatocytes in the mouse liver parenchyma without disrupting normal liver histology at 6 months after transplantation. This work provides insights into the functions of nuclear receptor THRB and highlights the importance of the environmental factors-nuclear receptors axis in regulating maturation of human PSC-differentiated cell types.","NWD1, a mouse purified western diet uniquely relevant to human nutritional exposures elevating risk for human sporadic colon cancer rapidly and reversibly altered the stem cell signature and transcriptome of Lgr5hi intestinal stem cells. Down-regulated Ppargc1a expression altered mitochondrial structure and function, metabolically reprogramming Lgr5hi cells, suppressing developmental maturation of their progeny as they progress through progenitor cell compartments. This recruited Bmi1+, Ascl2 cells, remodeling the mucosa, including cell adaptation to the altered nutritional environment and elevated pathways of antigen processing and presentation, especially in mature enterocytes, a pathogenic mechanism in human Inflammatory Bowel Disease resulting in chronic low-level pro-tumorigenic inflammation. Plasticity of intestinal cells to function as stem-like cells encompasses a physiological and continual response to changing nutritional environments, supporting historic concepts of tissue homeostasis as a process of continual adaptation to the environment, with important consequences for mechanisms establishing probability for tumor development. The data emphasize importance of better reflecting human nutritional exposures in mouse models of development and disease.","Megalin/LRP2 is a receptor that plays important roles in the physiology of several organs, such as kidney, lung, intestine, and gallbladder; and also in the physiology of the nervous system. Megalin expression is reduced in diseases associated with fibrosis, including diabetic nephropathy, hepatic fibrosis and cholelithiasis, as well as in some breast and prostate cancers. One of the hallmarks of these conditions is the presence of the cytokine transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u00df). Although TGF-\u00df has been implicated in the reduction of megalin levels, the molecular mechanism underlying this regulation is not well understood. Here, we show that treatment of two epithelial cell lines (from kidney and gallbladder) with TGF-\u00df1 is associated with decreased megalin mRNA and protein levels, and that these effects are reversed by inhibiting the TGF-\u00df1 type I receptor (TGF-\u00dfRI). Based on in silico analyses, the two SMAD-binding elements (SBEs) in the megalin promoter are located at positions \u221257 and \u2212605. Site-directed mutagenesis of the SBEs and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments revealed that SMAD2/3 transcription factors interact with SBEs to repress the megalin promoter and that they are also required for the repressing role of TGF-\u00df1. In addition, high concentration of albumin reduced megalin expression and promoter activation that depend on the expression of SMAD2/3. Interestingly, the histone deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA), which induces megalin expression, reduced the effects of TGF-\u00df1on megalin mRNA levels. These data show the significance of TGF-\u00df and the SMAD2/3 signalling pathway in the regulation of megalin and explain the decreased megalin levels observed under conditions in which TGF-\u00df is upregulated, including fibrosis-associated diseases and cancer.","Geographically widespread species that occupy many thermal environments provide testable models for understanding the evolution of life-history responses to latitude, yet studies that draw range-wide conclusions using descriptive data from populations in the core of a species\u2019 distribution can overlook meaningful inter-population variation. The phrynosomatid lizard Phrynosoma cornutum spans an extensive latitudinal distribution in North America and has been well-studied in connection with life-history evolution, yet populations occupying the most northern and coldest areas within its range were absent from previous examinations. We tested genus-wide models and challenged species-specific findings on the evolution of the life-history strategy for P. cornutum using populations at the northern edge of its geographic range and comparative material from farther south. Multivariate analyses revealed that egg dimensions decreased with clutch size, suggestive of a previously unrecognized tradeoff between egg size and egg number in this species. Interestingly, reproductive traits of females with shelled eggs did not covary with latitude, yet we found that populations at the highest latitudes typified several traits of the genus and for the species, including a model for Phrynosoma of large clutches and delayed reproduction. A significant deviation from earlier findings is that we detected latitudinal variation in clutch size. This finding, although novel, is unsurprising given the smaller body sizes from northern populations and the positive relationship between clutch size and body size. Intriguing, however, was that the significant reduction in clutch size persisted when female body size was held constant, indicating a reproductive disadvantage to living at higher latitudes. We discuss the possible selective pressures that may have resulted in the diminishing returns on reproductive output at higher latitudes. Our findings highlight the type of insights in the study of life-history evolution that can be gained across Phrynosomatidae from the inclusion of populations representing latitudinal endpoints.","Background: Epistasis and gene-environment interactions are known to contribute significantly to variation of complex phenotypes in model organisms. However, their identification in human association studies remains challenging for myriad reasons. In the case of epistatic interactions, the large number of potential interacting sets of genes presents computational, multiple hypothesis correction, and other statistical power issues. In the case of gene-environment interactions, the lack of consistently measured environmental covariates in most disease studies precludes searching for interactions and creates difficulties for replicating studies.","Interactions between macrophages, cardiac cells and the extracellular matrix are crucial for cardiac repair following myocardial infarction (MI). The paracrine effects of cell-based treatments of MI might modulate these interactions and impact cardiac repair. The immunomodulatory capacity of the therapeutic cells is therefore of interest and could be modulated by the use of biomaterials. We first showed that bone marrow cells (BMC) associated with fibrin could treat MI. Then, we interrogated the influence of fibrin, as a biologically active scaffold, on the secretome of BMC and the impact of their association on macrophage fate and cardiomyoblast proliferation.","Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies enable a better understanding of previously unexplored biological diversity. Oftentimes, researchers are specifically interested in modeling the latent structures and variations enriched in one target scRNA-seq dataset as compared to another background dataset generated from sources of variation irrelevant to the task at hand. For example, we may wish to isolate factors of variation only present in measurements from patients with a given disease as opposed to those shared with data from healthy control subjects. Here we introduce Contrastive Variational Inference (contrastiveVI; https://github.com/suinleelab/contrastiveVI), a framework for end-to-end analysis of target scRNA-seq datasets that decomposes the variations into shared and target-specific factors of variation. On four target-background dataset pairs, we apply contrastiveVI to perform a number of standard analysis tasks, including visualization, clustering, and differential expression testing, and we consistently achieve results that agree with known biological ground truths.","We present an effective model All-Trans Retinoic Acid (ATRA)-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells. The model describes a key architectural feature of ATRA-induced differentiation, positive feedback between an ATRA-inducible signalsome complex involving many proteins including Vav1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, and the activation of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. The model, which was developed by integrating logical rules with kinetic modeling, was significantly smaller than previous models. However, despite its simplicity, it captured key features of ATRA induced differentiation of HL-60 cells. We identified an ensemble of effective model parameters using measurements taken from ATRA-induced HL-60 cells. Using these parameters, model analysis predicted that MAPK activation was bistable as a function of ATRA exposure. Conformational experiments supported ATRA-induced bistability. These findings, combined with other literature evidence, suggest that positive feedback is central to a diversity of cell fate programs.","Background Genetic and environmental risk factors contribute to periodontal disease, but the underlying susceptibility pathways are not fully understood. Epigenetic mechanisms are malleable regulators of gene function that can change in response to genetic and environmental stimuli, thereby providing a potential mechanism for mediating risk effects in periodontitis. The aim of this study is to identify epigenetic changes across tissues that are associated with periodontal disease.","Work in animal models suggest that bone structure adapts to local bone strain, but this relationship has not been comprehensively studied in humans. Here, we quantified the influence of strain magnitude and gradient on bone adaptation in the forearm of premenopausal women performing compressive forearm loading (n=11) and non-loading controls (n=10). High resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HRpQCT) scans of the distal radius acquired at baseline and 12 months of a randomized controlled experiment were used to identify local sites of bone formation and resorption. Bone strain was estimated using validated finite element (FE) models. Trabecular strain magnitude and gradient were higher near (within 200 \u00b5m) formation versus resorption (p&lt;0.05). Trabecular formation and resorption occurred preferentially near very high (&gt;95th percentile) versus low (&lt;5th percentile) strain magnitude and gradient elements, and very low strain elements were more likely to be near resorption than formation (p&lt;0.05). In the cortical compartment, strain gradient was higher near formation versus resorption (p&lt;0.05), and both formation and resorption occurred preferentially near very high versus low strain gradient elements (p&lt;0.05). At most, 54% of very high and low strain elements were near formation or resorption only, and similar trends were observed in the control and load groups. These findings suggest that strain, likely in combination with other physiological factors, influences adaptation under normal loads and in response to a novel loading intervention, and represents an important step toward defining exercise interventions to maximize bone strength.","Resistance-exercise volume is a determinant of training outcomes. However not all individuals respond in a dose-dependent fashion. In this study, 34 healthy individuals (males n = 16, age 23.6 (4.1) years; females n = 18, 22.0 (1.3) years) performed moderate- (3 sets per exercise, MOD) and low-volume (1 set, LOW) resistance training contralateral fashion for 12 weeks (2-3 sessions \u00d7 week\u22121) enabling intra-individual comparisons of effects of training modalities. Muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) and muscle strength was assessed at weeks 0 and 12, along with biopsy sampling (m. Vastus lateralis). Muscle biopsies were also sampled before and one hour after the fifth session (Week 2). MOD resulted in larger increases in muscle CSA (5.2 (3.8)% versus 3.7 (3.7)%, P &lt; 0.001) and strength (3.4-7.7% difference, all P &lt; 0.05). In muscle, this coincided with greater reductions in type IIX fibres from week 0 to week 12 (MOD, \u22124.6 vs. LOW - 3.2%-point), greater post-exercise (Week 2) phosphorylation of mTOR (12%), S6-kinase 1 (19%) and ribosomal protein S6 (28%, Week 2), greater rested-state total RNA (8.8%, Week 2) and greater exercise-induced elevation of c-Myc mRNA expression (25%, Week 2; all P &lt; 0.05). Fifteen participants displayed robust benefits of MOD on muscle hypertrophy. This was associated with greater accumulation of total RNA at Week 2 in MOD vs. LOW as every 1% difference increased the odds of MOD benefit by 5.4% (P = 0.010). In conclusion, MOD led to on average greater adaptations to resistance training and dose-dependent hypertrophy was associated with volume-dependent regulation of total RNA at week 2. This suggests that ribosomal biogenesis regulates the dose-response relationship between training volume and muscle hypertrophy.","Desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT) is an aggressive, usually incurable sarcoma subtype that predominantly occurs in post-pubertal young males. Recent evidence suggests that the androgen receptor (AR) can promote tumor progression in DSRCTs. However, the mechanism of AR-induced oncogenic stimulation remains undetermined. Herein, we demonstrate that enzalutamide and AR-directed antisense oligonucleotides (AR-ASO) block 5\u03b1-dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-induced DSRCT cell proliferation and reduce xenograft tumor burden. Gene expression analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) were performed to elucidate how AR signaling regulates cellular epigenetic programs. Remarkably, ChIP-seq revealed novel DSRCT-specific AR DNA binding sites adjacent to key oncogenic regulators, including WT1 (the C-terminal partner of the pathognomonic fusion protein) and FOXF1. Additionally, AR occupied enhancer sites that regulate the Wnt pathway, neural differentiation, and embryonic organ development, implicating AR in dysfunctional cell lineage commitment. Our findings have immediate clinical implications given the widespread availability of FDA-approved androgen-targeted agents used for prostate cancer.","Retinoic acid (RA) is a major regulatory signal during embryogenesis produced from vitamin A (retinol) by an extensive, autoregulating metabolic and signaling network to prevent fluctuations that result in developmental malformations. Xenopus laevis is an allotetraploid hybrid frog species whose genome includes L (long) and S (short) chromosomes from the originating species. Evolutionarily, the X. laevis subgenomes have been losing either L or S homoeologs in about 43% of genes to generate singletons. In the RA network, out of the 47 genes, about 46% have lost one of the homoeologs, like the genome average. In contrast, RA metabolism genes from storage (retinyl esters) to retinaldehyde production exhibit enhanced gene loss with 75% singletons out of 28 genes. The effect of this gene loss on RA signaling autoregulation was studied. Employing transient RA manipulations, homoeolog gene pairs were identified in which one homeolog exhibits enhanced responses or looser regulation than the other, while in other pairs both homoeologs exhibit similar RA responses. CRISPR /Cas9 targeting of individual homoeologs to reduce their activity supports the hypothesis where the RA metabolic network gene loss results in tighter network regulation and more efficient RA robustness responses to overcome complex regulation conditions.","Ubiquitin ligases (E3s) embedded in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane regulate essential cellular activities including protein quality control, calcium flux, and sterol homeostasis. At least 25 different, transmembrane domain (TMD)-containing E3s are predicted to be ER-localised, but for most their organisation and cellular roles remain poorly defined. Using a comparative proteomic workflow, we mapped over 450 protein-protein interactions for 21 different stably expressed, full-length E3s. Bioinformatic analysis linked ER-E3s and their interactors to multiple homeostatic, regulatory, and metabolic pathways. Among these were four membrane-embedded interactors of RNF26, a polytopic E3 whose abundance is auto-regulated by ubiquitin-proteasome dependent degradation. RNF26 co-assembles with TMEM43, ENDOD1, TMEM33 and TMED1 to form a complex capable of modulating innate immune signalling through the cGAS-STING pathway. This RNF26 complex represents a new modulatory axis of STING and innate immune signalling at the ER membrane. Collectively, these data reveal the broad scope of regulation and differential functionalities mediated by ER-E3s for both membrane-tethered and cytoplasmic processes.","Betel-nut consumption is the fourth most common addictive habit globally and there is good evidence to link it with obesity, type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. We adopted a genome-wide transcriptomic approach in a human monocyte cell line incubated with arecoline and its nitrosated products to identify gene expression changes relevant to obesity, type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. The THP1 monocyte cell line was incubated separately with arecoline and 3-methylnitrosaminopropionaldehyde (MNPA) in triplicate for 24 hours and pooled cDNA indexed paired-end libraries were sequenced (Illumina NextSeq 500). After incubation with arecoline and MNPA, 15 and 39 genes respectively had significant changes in their expression (q&lt;0.05, log fold change 1.5). Eighteen of those genes have reported associations with type 2 diabetes and obesity in humans; of these genes there was strong evidence to implicate CLEC10A, MAPK8IP1, NEGR1, NQ01 and INHBE. In summary, these pilot studies have identified a large number of genes whose expression was changed significantly in human TPH1 cells following incubation with arecoline or with 3-methylnitrosaminopropionaldehyde. These findings suggest that further investigation of these genes in betel-quid chewers with obesity and/or type 2 diabetes is warranted.","Bone mineral density distributions (BMDDs) are a measurable property of bone tissues that depends strongly on bone remodelling and mineralisation processes. These processes can vary significantly in health and disease and across skeletal sites, so there is high interest in analysing these processes from experimental BMDDs. Here, we propose a rigorous hypothesis-testing approach based on a mathematical model of mineral heterogeneity in bone due to remodelling and mineralisation, to help explain differences observed between the BMDD of human femoral cortical bone and the BMDD of human trabecular bone. Recent BMDD measurements show that femoral cortical bone possesses a higher bone mineral density, but a similar mineral heterogeneity around the mean compared to trabecular bone. By combining this data with the mathematical model, we are able to test whether this difference in BMDD can be explained by (i) differences in turnover rate; (ii) differences in osteoclast resorption behaviour; and (iii) differences in mineralisation kinetics between the two bone types. We find that accounting only for differences in turnover rate is inconsistent with the fact that both BMDDs have a similar spread around the mean, and that accounting for differences in osteoclast resorption behaviour leads to biologically inconsistent bone remodelling patterns. We conclude that the kinetics of mineral accumulation in bone matrix must therefore be different in femoral cortical bone and trabecular bone. Although both cortical and trabecular bone are made up of lamellar bone, the different mineralisation kinetics in the two types of bone point towards more profound structural differences than usually assumed.","Ligand-activated nuclear receptors (NRs) including steroid receptors orchestrate development, growth, and reproduction across all animal lifeforms - the Metazoa - but how NRs evolved remains mysterious. Given the universality of terpenoids - including steroids and retinoids - as activating NR ligands, we asked if NRs might have evolved from enzymes that catalyze terpene synthesis and metabolism. We provide evidence suggesting that NRs are a sub-branch of the terpene synthase (TS) enzyme superfamily. Based on over ten thousand 3D structural comparisons, backed up by multiple primary sequence alignments and mapping of ligand-contacting residues, we report that the NR ligand-binding domain and TS enzymes share a conserved core of seven \u03b1-helical segments. Primary sequence comparisons reveal potential amino acid sequence similarities between NRs and the subfamily of cis-isoprene transferases, in particular dehydrodolichyl pyrophosphate synthase (DHDPPS) and its obligate partner, NUS1/NOGOB receptor. Our results suggest that a ligand-gated receptor may have arisen from an enzyme antecedent, and thus resolve the long-standing debate about whether the ancestral NR was unliganded. This would also explain aspects of NR ligand 'promiscuity', with implications for the development of pharmaceuticals targeting NRs and TS enzymes.","Autophagy is an extremely essential cellular process aimed to clear redundant and damaged materials. In this study, we demonstrated that mTOR dependent classical autophagy is ubiquitously triggered in differentiating monocytes. Moreover, autophagy plays a decisive role in sustaining the process of monocyte to macrophage differentiation. We have delved deeper into understanding the underlying mechanistic complexities that trigger autophagy during differentiation. We have also shown that autophagy directs monocyte differentiation via protein degradation. Further, we delineated the complex cross-talk between autophagy and cell-cycle arrest in differentiating monocytes. This study also inspects the contribution of adhesion on various steps of autophagy and its ultimate impact on monocyte differentiation. Our study reveals new mechanistic insights into the process of autophagy associated with monocyte differentiation and would undoubtedly help to understand the intricacies of the process better for the effective design of therapeutics as autophagy and autophagy-related processes have enormous importance in human patho-physiology.","Sodium-bile acid cotransporter, also denominated sodium-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) is an integral membrane protein with multiple hydrophobic transmembrane domains. The third extracellular domain of NTCP presents a stretch of nine aminoacids (KGIVISLVL) that is characterized by pronounced hydrophobicity and serves as receptor for a protein, preS1, showing the hydrophobic epta-peptide sequence NPLGFFP. Vitamin D-binding protein macrophage activating factor (DBP-MAF) is a multifunctional protein that is characterized by two hydrophobic regions able to bind fatty acids and vitamin D, respectively. Here we demonstrate that NTCP and DBP-MAF show significant sequence similarities as far as hydrophobic stretches of aminoacids are concerned. Alignment of the sequence of seven aminoacids preceding the 157-KGIVISLVL-165 stretch of NTCP shows four aminoacids that are identical to those of the corresponding sequence of DBP-MAF, and two that are conserved substitutions. In addition, in the sequence of DBP-MAF that is aligned with the sequence YKGIVISLVL of NTCP, there are two contiguous negatively charged aminoacids (ED) and, in the preceding epta-peptide sequence, there are three negatively charged aminoacids (D-ED), whereas in the corresponding sequence of NTCP there are only two (D--D) that are not contiguous. This concentration of negatively charged aminoacids may be involved in binding of protein inserts characterized by high density of positively charges residues. The alternating hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions described in this paper may help elucidating the biological roles of these proteins as far as protein-protein interactions are concerned.","Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are pervasive neurodevelopmental disorders entailing social and cognitive deficits, including marked problems with language. Numerous genes have been associated with ASD, but it is unclear how language deficits arise from gene mutation or dysregulation. It is also unclear why ASD shows such high prevalence within human populations. Interestingly, the emergence of a modern faculty of language has been hypothesised to be linked to changes in the human brain/skull, but also to the process of self-domestication of the human species. It is our intention to show that people with ASD exhibit less marked domesticated traits at the morphological, physiological, and behavioural levels. We also discuss many ASD candidates represented among the genes known to be involved in the domestication syndrome (the constellation of traits exhibited by domesticated mammals, which seemingly results from the hypofunction of the neural crest) and among the set of genes involved in language function closely connected to them. Moreover, many of these genes show altered expression profiles in the brain of autists. In addition, some candidates for domestication and language-readiness show the same expression profile in people with ASD and chimps in different brain areas involved in language processing. Similarities regarding the brain oscillatory behaviour of these areas can be expected too. We conclude that ASD may represent an abnormal ontogenetic itinerary for the human faculty of language resulting in part from changes in genes important for the domestication syndrome and, ultimately, from the normal functioning of the neural crest.","A prolonged therapy, primarily responsible for development of drug resistance by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), obligates any new TB regimen to not only reduce treatment duration but also escape pathogen resistance mechanisms. With the aim of harnessing the host response in providing support to existing regimens, we used sertraline (SRT) to stunt the pro-pathogenic type I IFN response of macrophages to infection. While SRT alone could only arrest bacterial growth, it effectively escalated the bactericidal activities of Isoniazid (H) and Rifampicin (R) in macrophages. This strengthening of antibiotic potencies by SRT was more evident in conditions of ineffective control by these frontline TB drug, against tolerant strains or dormant Mtb. SRT, could significantly combine with standard TB drugs to enhance early pathogen clearance from tissues of mice infected with either drug sensitive/ tolerant strains of Mtb. Further, we demonstrate an enhanced protection in acute TB infection of the highly susceptible C3HeB/FeJ mice with the combination therapy signifying the use of SRT as a potent adjunct to standard TB therapeutic regimens against bacterial populations of diverse physiology. This study advocates a novel host directed adjunct therapy regimen for TB with a clinically approved anti-depressant to achieve quicker and greater control of infection.","Neck of femur (NOF) fracture is a prevalent fracture type amongst the ageing and osteoporotic populations, commonly requiring total hip replacement (THR) surgery. Increased fracture risk has also been associated with Alzheimer disease (AD) in the aged. Here, we sought to identify possible relationships between the pathologies of osteoporosis and dementia by analysing bone expression of neurotropic or dementia-related genes in patients undergoing THR surgery for NOF fracture. Femoral bone samples from 66 NOF patients were examined for expression of the neurotropic genes amyloid precursor protein (APP), APP-like protein-2 (APLP2), Beta Secretase Cleaving Enzyme-1 (BACE1) and nerve growth factor (NGF). Relationships were examined between the expression of these and of bone regulatory genes, systemic factors and bone structural parameters ascertained from plain radiographs. We found strong relative levels of expression and positive correlations between APP, APLP2, BACE1 and NGF levels in NOF bone. Significant correlations were found between APP, APLP2, BACE1 mRNA levels and bone remodelling genes TRAP, RANKL, and the RANKL:OPG mRNA ratio, indicative of potential functional relationships at the time of fracture. Analysis of the whole cohort, as well as non-dementia and dementia sub-groups, revealed structural relationships between APP and APLP2 mRNA expression and lateral femoral cortical thickness. These findings suggest that osteoporosis and AD may share common molecular pathways of disease progression, perhaps explaining the common risk factors associated with these diseases. The observation of a potential pathologic role for AD-related genes in bone may also provide alternative treatment strategies for osteoporosis and fracture prevention.","Human skin provides both physical integrity and immunological protection from the external environment using functionally distinct layers, cell types and extracellular matrix. Despite its central role in human health and disease, the constituent proteins of skin have not been systematically characterized. Here, we combined advanced tissue dissection methods, flow cytometry and state-of-the-art proteomics to describe a spatially-resolved quantitative proteomic atlas of human skin. We quantified 10,701 proteins as a function of their spatial location and cellular origin. The resulting protein atlas and our initial data analyses demonstrate the value of proteomics for understanding cell-type diversity within the skin. We describe the quantitative distribution of structural proteins, known and novel proteins specific to cellular subsets and those with specialized immunological functions such as cytokines and chemokines. We anticipate that this proteomic atlas of human skin will become an essential community resource for basic and translational research (www.skin.science).","The majority of people over the age of 65 take two or more medications. While many individual drug side effects are known, polypharmacy side effects due to novel drug combinations poses great risk. Here, we present APRILE: an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) framework that uses graph neural networks to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying polypharmacy side effects. Given a list of side effects and the pairs of drugs causing them, APRILE identifies a set of proteins (drug targets or non-targets) and associated Gene Ontology (GO) terms as mechanistic \u2018explanations\u2019 of associated side effects. Using APRILE, we generate such explanations for 843,318 (learned) and 93,966 (novel) side effect\u2013drug pair events, spanning 861 side effects (472 diseases, 485 symptoms and 9 mental disorders) and 20 disease cate-gories. We show that our two new metrics\u2014pharmacogenomic information utilization and protein-protein interaction information utilization\u2014provide quantitative estimates of mechanism complexity. Explanations were significantly consistent with state of the art disease-gene associations for 232/239 (97%) side effects. Further, APRILE generated new insights into molecular mechanisms of four diverse categories of adverse drug reactions: infection, metabolic diseases, gastrointestinal diseases, and mental disorders, including paradoxical side effects. We demonstrate the viability of discovering polypharmacy side effect mechanisms by training an XAI framework on massive biomedical data. Consequently, it facilitates wider and more reliable use of AI in healthcare.","Granulomas are complex cellular structures comprised predominantly of macrophages and lymphocytes that function to contain and kill invading pathogens. Here, we investigated single cell phenotypes associated with antimicrobial responses in human leprosy granulomas by applying single cell and spatial sequencing to leprosy biopsy specimens. We focused on reversal reactions (RR), a dynamic process in which some patients with disseminated lepromatous leprosy (L-lep) transition towards self-limiting tuberculoid leprosy (T-lep), mounting effective antimicrobial responses. We identified a set of genes encoding proteins involved in antimicrobial responses that are differentially expressed in RR versus L-lep lesions, and regulated by IFN-\u03b3 and IL-1\u03b2. By integrating the spatial coordinates of the key cell types and antimicrobial gene expression in RR and T-lep lesions, we constructed a map revealing the organized architecture of granulomas depicting compositional and functional layers by which macrophages, T cells, keratinocytes and fibroblasts contribute to the antimicrobial response.","Urine accommodates more changes than other fluids, and it is a good source in the search for early sensitive biomarkers. The present study collected urine samples from 2-, 4-, 6-, 8- and 10-month-old \u03b1-synuclein transgenic mice. Based on data-independent acquisition (DIA) technology, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used for quantitative analysis. Seventeen human homologous differential proteins were screened and compared with those in the urine of 2-month-old mice, and 9 proteins were related to Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). Formin-2, Splicing factor 3A subunit 1, and Isopentenyl-diphosphate Delta-isomerase 1 changed continuously in months 6, 8 and 10. These experiments and analyses demonstrated that the urine proteome reflected the development of \u03b1-synuclein transgenic mice and provided clues for the early clinical diagnosis of PD.","Cell types are the fundamental building blocks of metazoan biodiversity and offer a powerful perspective for inferring evolutionary phenomena. With the development of single-cell transcriptomic techniques, new definitions of cell types are emerging. This allows a conceptual reassessment of traditional definitions of novel cell types and their evolution. Research in echinoderms, particularly sea star and sea urchin embryos have contributed significantly to understanding the evolution of novel cell types, in particular the primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs) and pigment cells that are found in sea urchin but not sea star embryos. This paper outlines the development of a gene expression atlas for the bat star, Patiria miniata, using single nuclear RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of embryonic stages. The atlas revealed 22 cell clusters covering all expected cell types from the endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm germ layers. In particular, four distinct neural clusters, an immune cluster, and distinct right and left coelom clusters were revealed as distinct cell states. A comparison with Strongylocentrotus purpuratus embryo single cell transcriptomes was performed using 1:1 orthologs to anchor and then compare gene expression patterns. S. purpuratus primordial germ cell equivalents were not detected in P. minata, while the left coelom of P. miniata has no equivalent cell cluster in S. purpuratus. Pigment cells of S. purpuratus map to clusters containing immune mesenchyme and neural cells of P. miniata, while the PMCs of S. purpuratus are revealed as orthologous to the right coelom cluster of P. miniata. These results suggest a new interpretation of the evolution of these well-studied cell types and a reflection on the definition of novel cell types.","The genetic components of microbial species that inhabit the body are known collectively as the microbiome. Modifications to the microbiome have been implicated in disease processes throughout the body and have recently been shown to influence bone. Prior work has associated changes in the microbial taxonomy (phyla, class, species, etc.) in the gut with bone phenotypes but has provided limited information regarding mechanisms. With the goal of achieving a more mechanistic understanding of the effects of the microbiome on bone, we perform a metagenomic analysis of the gut microbiome that provides information on the functional capacity of the microbes (all microbial genes present) rather than only characterizing the microbial taxa. Male C57Bl/6 mice were subjected to disruption of the gut microbiota (\u0394Microbiome) using oral antibiotics (from 4-16 weeks of age) or remained untreated (n=6-7/group). Disruption of the gut microbiome in this manner has been shown to lead to reductions in tissue mechanical properties and whole bone strength in adulthood with only minor changes in bone geometry and density. \u0394Microbiome led to modifications in the abundance of microbial genes responsible for the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall and capsule; bacterially synthesized carbohydrates; and bacterially synthesized vitamins (B and K) (p &lt;0.01). Follow up analysis focused on vitamin K, a factor that has previously been associated with bone health. The vitamin K content of the cecum, liver and kidneys was primarily microbe-derived forms of vitamin K (menaquinones) and was decreased by 32-66% in \u0394Microbiome mice compared to untreated animals (p &lt; 0.01). Bone mineral crystallinity was decreased (p=0.01) was decreased in \u0394Microbiome mice (p &lt; 0.001) and matrix carbonate-phosphoate ratio was increased. This study illustrates the use of metagenomic analysis to link the microbiome to bone phenotypes and implicates microbially synthesized vitamin-K as a regulator of bone matrix quality.","Opportunistic bacterial infections amongst HIV-infected individuals pose serious health challenge. While immediate control of bacterial pathogens is typically attributed to innate defense mechanisms, whether HIV-mediated modulation of innate mechanisms like autophagy promote opportunistic infections, remains obscure. Using U1.1 and U937 macrophages, we show, HIV activation or infection inhibits autophagy and helps survival of pathogenic Mycobacterium tuberculosis and non-pathogenic non-tuberculous mycobacterial strains (NTMs) like Mycobacterium avium complex and Mycobacterium fortuitum. HIV achieves this by blocking xenophagy flux, which could be reversed by the autophagy inducer trehalose that kills intracellular Mtb and NTMs. We found trehalose acts as a PI (3,5) P2 agonist and activates TRPML1 to induce autophagy. Remarkably, trehalose treatment significantly reduced p24 levels in PBMCs infected with clinical HIV strains and in PBMCs derived from treatment-naive HIV patients. Taken together, our study highlights the immense potential of autophagy modulators in the therapeutic intervention of HIV and associated opportunistic infection.","Less than 11% of pancreatic cancer patients survive 5-years post-diagnosis. The unique biology of pancreatic cancer includes a significant expansion of its desmoplastic tumor microenvironment, wherein cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and their self-produced extracellular matrix are key components. CAF functions are both tumor-supportive and tumor-suppressive, while normal fibroblastic cells are solely tumor-suppressive. Knowing that CAF-eliminating drugs are ineffective and can accelerate cancer progression, therapies that \u201cnormalize\u201d CAF function are highly pursued. Eribulin is a well-tolerated anti-microtubule drug used to treat a plethora of neoplasias, including advanced/metastatic cancers. Importantly, eribulin can inhibit epithelial to mesenchymal transition via a mechanism akin to blocking pathways induced by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF\u03b2). Notably, canonical TGF\u03b2 signaling also plays a pivotal role in CAF activation, which is necessary for the development and maintenance of desmoplasia. Hence, we hypothesized that eribulin could modulate, and perhaps \u201cnormalize\u201d CAF function. To test this premise, we used a well-established in vivo-mimetic fibroblastic cell-derived extracellular matrix (CDM) system and gauged the effects of eribulin on human pancreatic CAFs and cancer cells. The pathophysiologic cell-culturing system was also used to query eribulin effects on CDM-regulated cancer cell survival and invasive spread. Results demonstrated that intact CDMs modestly restricted eribulin from obstructing cancer cell growth. Nonetheless, eribulin-treated CAFs generated CDMs that limited cancer cell survival under nutritional stress, similar to reported tumor-suppressive CDMs generated by TGF\u03b2-deficient CAFs. Data from this study support the central proposed premise and suggest that eribulin could be used as a CAF-normalizing drug.","Membrane-less organelles are condensates formed by phase separation whose functions often remain enigmatic. Upon oxidative stress, PML scaffolds Nuclear Bodies (NBs) to regulate senescence or metabolic adaptation, but their role in pluripotency remains elusive. Here we establish that PML is required for basal SUMO2/3 conjugation in mESCs and oxidative stress-driven sumoylation in mESCs or in vivo. PML NBs create an oxidation-protective environment for UBC9-driven SUMO2/3 conjugation of PML partners, often followed by their poly-ubiquitination and degradation. Differential in vivo proteomics identified several members of the KAP1 complex as PML NB-dependent SUMO2-targets. The latter drives functional activation of this key epigenetic repressor. Accordingly, Pml\u2212/\u2212 mESCs re-express transposable elements and display features of totipotent-like cells, a process further enforced by PML-controlled SUMO2-conjugation of DPPA2. Finally, PML is required for adaptive stress responses in mESCs. Collectively, PML orchestrates mESC fate through SUMO2-conjugation of key transcriptional or epigenetic regulators, raising new mechanistic hypotheses about PML roles in normal or cancer stem cells.","Importin4 transports histone H3/H4 in complex with Asf1a to the nucleus for chromatin assembly. Importin4 recognizes the nuclear localization sequence located at the N-terminal tail of histones. Here, we analyzed the structures and interactions of human Importin4, histones and Asf1a by cross-linking mass spectrometry, X-ray crystallography, negative-stain electron microscopy, small-angle X-ray scattering and integrative modeling. The XL-MS data showed that the C-terminal region of Importin4 interacts extensively with the histone H3 tail. We determined the crystal structure of the C-terminal region of Importin4 bound to the histone H3 peptide, thus revealing that the acidic path in Importin4 accommodates the histone H3 tail and that histone H3 Lys14 is the primary residue interacting with Importin4. Furthermore, the molecular architecture of the Importin4_histone H3/H4_Asf1a complex was produced through an integrative modeling approach. Overall, this work provides structural insights into how Importin4 recognizes histones and their chaperone complex.","The liver X receptor (LXR) is a key transcriptional regulator of cholesterol, fatty acid, and phospholipid metabolism. Dynamic remodeling of immunometabolic pathways, including lipid metabolism, is a crucial step in T cell activation. Here we explored the role of LXR-regulated metabolic processes in primary human CD4+ T cells, and their role in controlling plasma membrane lipids (glycosphingolipids and cholesterol) which strongly influence T cell immune signaling and function. Crucially, we identified the glycosphingolipid biosynthesis enzyme glucosylceramide synthase (UGCG) as a direct transcriptional LXR target. LXR activation by agonist GW3965 or endogenous oxysterol ligands significantly altered the glycosphingolipid:cholesterol balance in the plasma membrane by increasing glycosphingolipid levels and reducing cholesterol. Consequently, LXR activation lowered plasma membrane lipid order (stability), and an LXR antagonist could block this effect. LXR stimulation also reduced lipid order at the immune synapse and accelerated activation of proximal T cell signaling molecules. Ultimately, LXR activation dampened pro-inflammatory T cell function. Finally, compared to responder T cells, regulatory T cells had a distinct pattern of LXR-target gene expression corresponding to reduced lipid order. This suggests LXR-driven lipid metabolism could contribute to functional specialization of these T cell subsets. Overall, we report a novel mode of action for LXR in T cells involving the regulation of glycosphingolipid and cholesterol metabolism, and demonstrate its relevance in modulating T cell function.","Human evolution involves population splits, size fluctuations, founder effects, and admixture. Population history reconstruction based on genetic diversity data routinely relies on simple demographic models while projecting the past. No specific demographic assumptions are needed to understand the genetic structure of the founder population of Qu\u00e9bec. Because genealogy and genetics are intimately related, we used descending genealogies of this population to pursue the fate of its founder lineages. Maternal and paternal lines reflect the transmission of mtDNA and the Y-chromosome, respectively. We followed their transmission in real-time, from the 17th century down to its 20th-century population. We counted the number of married children of immigrants (i.e., their effective family size, EFS), estimated the proportion of successful immigrants in terms of their survival ratio, and assessed net growth rates and extinction. Likewise, we evaluated the same parameters for their Qu\u00e9bec-born descendants. The survival ratio of the first immigrants was the highest and declined over time in association with the decreasing immigrants\u2019 EFS. Parents with high EFS left plentiful married progeny, putting EFS as the most important variable determining the parental demographic success throughout time for generations ahead. The 17th and 18th-century immigrants bear the most remarkable demographic and genetic impact on the 20th-century population of Qu\u00e9bec. Lessons learned from Qu\u00e9bec genealogies can teach us about the consequences of founder effects and migrations through real people\u2019s history. The effective family size of immigrant founders predicts their long-term demographic outcome.","Obesity is the leading proportional cause for diabetes, heart disease and cancer. Obesity occurs because the body stores surplus calories as fat. Fat cells secrete a hormone, leptin, that modulates energy balance at the brain. Changes in fat mass are mirrored by changes in serum leptin. Increases in leptin cause the brain to decrease appetite and increase energy expenditure. However in obesity, leptin sensitivity is decreased which mutes leptin mediated changes in appetite and energy expenditure. We have limited understanding of what controls leptin production by fat or how sensitive the brain is to leptin. Muscle produces a hormone, myostatin, that plays an analogous role to the role that leptin plays in fat. Absent myostatin leads to increased muscle mass and strength. We also do not know what controls myostatin production or sensitivity. Although fat mass and muscle mass are closely linked, the interplay between leptin and myostatin remains unexplored. Vitamin D improves lean mass via what are thought to be primarily trophic effects at the muscle. Here we show that high dose dietary vitamin D preferentially allocates excess calories to muscle and growth instead of storage as fat by decreasing myostatin production and increasing leptin production and sensitivity. That is, high dose vitamin D improves organismal energy sensing. Obesity, aging and other chronic inflammatory diseases are associated with decreased muscle function and mass. Our work provides a physiologic framework for how high-dose vitamin D would be effective in these pathologies to increase allocation of calories to muscle instead of fat and reveals novel interplay between the myostatin and leptin signaling whereby myostatin conveys energy needs to modulate leptin effects on calorie allocation.  Furthermore, our work reveals how physiologic seasonal variation in vitamin D may be important in controlling season-specific metabolism and calorie allocation to fat in winter and muscle in summer.","Corneal epithelial cells derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are an important cell source for preclinical models to test ophthalmic drugs. However, current differentiation protocols lack instructions regarding optimal culturing conditions, which hinders the quality of cells and limits scale-up. Here, we introduce a simplified small molecule-based corneal induction method (SSM-CI) to generate corneal epithelial cells from hPSCs. SSM-CI provides the advantage of minimizing cell culturing time using two defined culturing media containing TGF-\u03b2, and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway inhibitors, and bFGF growth factor over 25 days. Compared to the conventional human corneal epithelial cell line (HCE-T) and human primary corneal epithelial cells (hPCEpCs), corneal epithelial cells generated by SSM-CI are well-differentiated and express relevant maturation markers, including PAX6 and CK12. RNA-seq analysis indicated the faithful differentiation of hPSCs into corneal epithelia, with significant upregulation of corneal progenitor and adult corneal epithelial phenotypes. Furthermore, despite the initial inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, upregulation of these pathway-related transcripts was observed in the later stages, indicating their necessity in the generation of mature corneal epithelial cells. Moreover, we observed a shift in gene signatures associated with the metabolic characteristics of mature corneal epithelial cells, involving a decrease in glycolysis- and an increase in fatty acid oxidation. This was also attributed to the overexpression of metabolic enzymes and transporter-related transcripts responsible for fatty acid metabolism. Thus, SSM-CI provides a comprehensive method for the generation of functional corneal epithelial cells for use in preclinical models.","Wearable light sensors are increasingly used in intervention and population-based studies investigating the consequences of environmental light exposure on human physiology. An important step in such analyses is the reliable detection of non-wear time. We observed in light data that days with less wear-time also have lower variability in the light signal, and we sought to test if the standard deviation of the change between subsequent samples can detect this condition. In this study, we propose and validate an easy-to-implement algorithm designed to discriminate between days with a non-wear time &gt;4h (\u201cinvalid days\u201d) vs. \u22644h (\u201cvalid days\u201d) and investigate to which extent values of commonly used physiologically meaningful light variables differ between invalid days, valid days, and algorithm-selected non-wear days. We used 83 days of light data from a field study with high participant compliance, complemented by 47 days of light data where free-living individuals were instructed not to wear the sensor for varying amounts of time. Light data were recorded every two minutes using the pendant-worn f.luxometer light sensor; validity was derived from daily logs where participants recorded all non-wear time. The algorithm-derived score discriminated well between valid and invalid days (area under the curve (AUC): 0.77, 95% CI: 0.67-0.87). The best cut-off value (i.e., highest Youden index) correctly recognized valid days with a probability of 87% (\u201csensitivity\u201d), and invalid days with a probability of 63% (\u201cspecificity\u201d). Values of various light variables derived from algorithm-selected days only (median: 264.3 (Q1: 153.6, Q3: 420.0) for 24h light intensity (in lux); 496.0 (404.0, 582.0) for time spent above 50-lux) gave values close to those derived from self-reported valid days only. However, these values did not significantly differ when derived across all days compared to self-reported valid days. Our results suggest that our proposed algorithm discriminates well between valid and invalid days. However, in high compliance cohorts, distortions in aggregated light measures of individual-level environmental light recordings across days appear to be small, making the application of our algorithm optional, but not necessary.","Most cases of breast cancer (BC) are estrogen receptor \u03b1-positive (ER\u03b1+) at diagnosis. The presence of ER\u03b1 drives the therapeutic approach for this disease, which often consists of endocrine therapy (ET). 4OH-Tamoxifen and faslodex (i.e., fulvestrant - ICI182,780) are two ETs that render tumor cells insensitive to 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2)-dependent proliferative stimuli and prevent BC progression. However, ET has limitations and serious failures in different tissues and organs. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify novel drugs to fight BC in the clinic. Re-positioning of old drugs for new clinical purposes is an attractive alternative for drug discovery. For this analysis, we focused on the modulation of intracellular ER\u03b1 levels in BC cells as target for the screening of about 900 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved compounds that would hinder E2:ER\u03b1 signaling and inhibit BC cell proliferation. We found that carfilzomib induces ER\u03b1 degradation and prevents E2 signaling and cell proliferation in two ER\u03b1+ BC cell lines. Remarkably, the analysis of carfilzomib effects on a cell model system with an acquired resistance to 4OH-tamoxifen revealed that this drug has an antiproliferative effect superior to faslodex in BC cells. Therefore, our results identify carfilzomib as a drug preventing E2:ER\u03b1 signaling and cell proliferation in BC cells and suggest its possible re-position for the treatment of ER\u03b1+ BC as well as for those diseases that have acquired resistance to 4OH-tamoxifen.","The study was conducted on 50 samples of coffee beans from various origins. The samples included green coffee beans, roasted beans, brew coffee drinks and coffee sludge. Three processes were used to prepare these samples: dried, semi-washed, and washed. Three synthetic pyrethroid insecticides and nine heavy metals were subsequently analyzed using modified Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe (QuEChERS) and acid digestion methods, respectively. The quantification of pyrethroids was performed by GC-\u03bcECD whereas those of metals were determined using flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer. According to the results, concentrations of both pyrethroids and heavy metals were predominantly found in green coffee beans except for Cr. Pyrethroid insecticides were not detectable in brew coffee drink and heavy metal concentrations were below the acceptable daily intake (ADI) level. Risk estimations for daily coffee intake using the health risk indices (HRIs) and target hazard quotients (THQs) of normal and the 97.5 percentile Thai consumers were less than 1. This indicated that the coffee drinks from studied samples could not cause potential health risk.","Acute myeloid leukemias (AML) are characterized by recurrent genomic alterations, often in transcriptional regulators, which form the basis on which current prognostication and therapeutic intervention is overlaid. In AML transformation can often be attributed to single chromosomal aberrations encoding oncogenes, such as t(15;17)-PML/RAR\u03b1 or t(6;9)-DEK/CAN but it is unclear how these aberrant transcription factors drive leukemic signaling and influence cellular responses to targeted therapies. Here we show that by using a novel \u201csubtractive interaction proteomics\u201d approach, the high risk AML-inducing oncogene t(6;9)-DEK/CAN directly activates signaling pathways that are driven by the ABL1, AKT/mTOR, and SRC family kinases. The interplay of these signaling pathways creates a network with nodes that are credible candidates for combinatorial therapeutic interventions. These results reveal specific interdependencies between nuclear oncogenes and cancer signaling pathways thus providing a foundation for the design of therapeutic strategies to better address the complexity of cancer signaling.","Soft tissue mineralization has been found to be a major component of diseases such as aortic valve stenosis and rheumatic heart disease. Cardiovascular mineralization has been suggested to follow mechanisms similar to those of bone formation with several cell culture models been developed over the years to provide mechanistic insights. These cell models have been characterized by a wide range of biochemical and molecular methods, which identified the presence of osteogenic markers and bone-like cells. However, there is a surprisingly small number of studies where the mineral formed in these cell culture models has been characterized by physico-chemical methods, and even fewer studies have compared this mineral to the one produced by bone cells in cultures. Here we investigated the morphology and composition of the minerals formed in cell cultures of vascular smooth muscle cells and bone cells. Electron microscopy and traditional cell mineralization assays were applied, revealing that vascular cells are indeed able to form calcified nodules of elemental composition similar to bone, however with different morphology. Comparison of morphologies of the two minerals to that found in cardiovascular tissue shows that some of tissue calcification resembles the calcified fibers produced by bone cells in vitro. These results suggest that the characterization of the mineral is of utmost importance and its morphology and chemical properties can contribute an important piece of information in the comprehensive analysis of soft tissue mineralization mechanisms, both in in vitro cell culture as well as in clinical samples.","To achieve high prediction accuracy with minimal inputs from online retail respondents, a method was developed and tested to predict the size and shape of the human body in 3D using a hormonal framework. The prediction method is based on geometric morphometrics, image analysis, and kernel partial least squares regression. The inputs required are answers to three closed-ended questions and a passport photo. Prediction accuracy was tested with the 3D body scan dataset of the Civilian American and European Surface Anthropometry Resource project. Results from the test dataset showed that approximately 82% of the error expectations of landmarks followed a log-normal distribution with an expectation of 8.816 mm and standard deviation of 1.180 mm. The remaining 18% of the error expectations of landmarks followed a log-normal distribution with an expectation of 18.454 mm and standard deviation of 8.844 mm, which may herald future research. Benchmarked with another method, the proposed method features much less input. In addition to high accuracy, the method in this paper allows for visualisation of results as real-size meshes in millimeters.","The analysis and interpretation of the RNA-Seq data can be time-consuming and challenging. We aim to streamline the bioinformatic analyses of gene-level data by developing a user-friendly web application for exploratory data analysis, differential expression, and pathway analysis. iDEP (integrated Differential Expression and Pathway analysis) seamlessly connects 63 R/Bioconductor packages, 208 annotation databases for plant and animal species, and 2 web services. The workflow can be reproduced by downloading customized R code and related files. As demonstrated by two examples, iDEP (http://ge-lab.org/idep/) democratizes access to bioinformatics resources and empowers biologists to easily gain actionable insights from transcriptomic data.","Domestication of crops and animals during the Holocene epoch played a critical role in shaping human culture, diet and genetic variation. This domestication process took place across a span of time and space, especially in Asia. We hypothesize that domestication of plants and animals around the world must have influenced the human genome differentially among human populations to a far greater degree than has been appreciated previously. The range of domesticated foods that were available in different regions can be expected to have created regionally distinct nutrient intake profiles and deficiencies. To capture this complexity, we used archaeobotanical evidence to construct two models of dietary nutrient composition over a 9000 year time span in Asia: one based on Larson et al. (2014) and measured through composition of 8 nutrients, and another taking into account a wider range of crops, cooking and lifestyle variation, and the dietary variables glycemic index and carbohydrate content. We hypothesize that the subtle dietary shifts through time and space have also influenced current human genetic variation among Asians. We used statistical methods BayeScEnv, BayeScan and Baypass, to examine the impact of our reconstructed long-term dietary habits on genome-wide genetic variation in 29 current-day Asian populations (Figure S1, Figure 1, Figure 2). Our results show that genetic variation in diet-related pathways is correlated with dietary differences among Asian populations. SNPs in five genes, GHR, LAMA1, SEMA3A, CAST and TCF7L2, involved in the gene ontologies \u2018salivary gland morphogenesis\u2019 and \u2018negative regulation of type B pancreatic cell apoptotic process\u2019 suggest that metabolism may have been primary targets of selection driven by dietary shifts. These shifts may have influenced biological pathways in ways that have a lasting impact on health. We present a case that archaeobotanical evidence can provide valuable insight for understanding how historical human niche construction might have influenced modern human genetic variation.","The avian hearing organ is the basilar papilla that, in sharp contrast to the mammalian cochlea, can regenerate sensory hair cells and thereby recover from complete deafness within weeks. The mechanisms that trigger, sustain, and terminate the regenerative response in vivo are largely unknown. Here, we profile the changes in gene expression in the chicken basilar papilla after aminoglycoside antibiotic-induced hair cell loss using RNA-sequencing. The most prominent changes in gene expression were linked to the upregulation of interferon response genes which occurred in supporting cells, confirmed by single-cell RNA-sequencing and in situ hybridization. We determined that the JAK/STAT signaling pathway is essential for the interferon gene response in supporting cells, set in motion by hair cell loss. Four days after ototoxic damage, we identified newly regenerated, nascent auditory hair cells that express genes linked to termination of the interferon response. These cells are incipient modified neurons that represent a population of hair cells en route towards obtaining their location-specific and fully functional cell identity. The robust, transient expression of immune-related genes in supporting cells suggests a potential functional involvement of JAK/STAT signaling and interferon in sensory hair cell regeneration.","Co-infections shape the host immune status, thereby influencing the development of inflammatory diseases, which can result in detrimental or beneficial effects. For example, co-infections with concurrent Plasmodium species can alter malaria clinical evolution and malaria infection itself has the ability to modulate autoimmune reactions but, in both cases, the underlying mechanisms remain ill-defined.","Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive disease characterized by increased levels of desmoplasia that contributes to reduced drug delivery and poor treatment outcomes. In PDAC, the stromal content can account for up to 90% of the total tumor volume. The complex interplay between stromal components, including pancreatic cancer associated fibroblasts (PCAFs), and PDAC cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) have a significant impact on prognoses and thus needs to be recapitulated in vitro when evaluating various treatment strategies. This study is a systematic evaluation of photodynamic therapy (PDT) in 3D heterotypic coculture models of PDAC with varying ratios of patient derived PCAFs that simulate heterogenous PDAC tumors with increasing stromal content. The efficacy of antibody-targeted PDT (photoimmunotherapy; PIT) using cetuximab photoimmunoconjugates (PICs) of benzoporphyrin derivative (BPD) is contrasted with that of liposomal BPD (Visudyne\u00ae), which is currently in PDT clinical trials for PDAC. We demonstrate that both Visudyne\u00ae-PDT and PIT were effective in heterotypic PDAC 3D spheroids with a low stromal content. However, as the stromal content increases above 50% in the 3D spheroids, the efficacy of Visudyne\u00ae-PDT is reduced by up to 10-fold, while PIT retains its efficacy. PIT was found to be 10-fold, 19-fold and 14-fold more phototoxic in spheroids with 50%, 75% and 90% PCAFs, respectively, as compared to Visudyne\u00ae-PDT. This marked difference in efficacy is attributed to the ability of PICs to penetrate and distribute within spheroids with a higher stromal content, whereas Visudyne\u00ae is restricted to the spheroid periphery. This study thus demonstrates how the stromal content in PDAC spheroids directly impacts their responsiveness to PDT and proposes PIT to be a highly suited treatment option for desmoplastic tumors with particularly high degrees of stromal content.","An outstanding mystery in biology is why some species, such as the axolotl, can scarlessly heal and regenerate tissues while most mammals cannot. Here, we demonstrate that rapid activation of protein synthesis is a unique, and previously uncharacterized, feature of the injury response critical for limb regeneration in the axolotl (A. mexicanum). By applying polysome sequencing, we identify hundreds of transcripts, including antioxidants and ribosome components, which do not change in their overall mRNA abundance but are selectively activated at the level of translation from pre-existing mRNAs in response to injury. In contrast, we show that protein synthesis is not activated in response to digit amputation in the non-regenerative mouse. We further identify the mTORC1 pathway as a key upstream signal that mediates this regenerative translation response in the axolotl. Inhibition of this pathway is sufficient to suppress translation and axolotl regeneration. Surprisingly, although mTOR is highly evolutionarily conserved, we discover unappreciated expansions in mTOR protein sequence among urodele amphibians. By engineering an axolotl mTOR in human cells, we demonstrate that this change creates a hypersensitive kinase that may allow axolotls to maintain this pathway in a highly labile state primed for rapid activation. This may underlie metabolic differences and nutrient sensing between regenerative and non-regenerative species that are key to regeneration. Together, these findings highlight the unanticipated impact of the translatome on orchestrating the early steps of wound healing in highly regenerative species and provide a missing link in our understanding of vertebrate regenerative potential.","Background Precision medicine approaches aim to tackle diseases on an individual level through molecular profiling. Despite the growing knowledge about diseases and the reported diversity of molecular phenotypes, the descriptions of human health on an individual level have been far less elaborate.","Summary Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the newly emergent causative agent of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), has resulted in more than one million deaths worldwide since it was first detected in 2019. There is a critical global need for therapeutic intervention strategies that can be deployed to safely treat COVID-19 disease and reduce associated morbidity and mortality. Increasing evidence shows that both natural and synthetic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), also referred to as Host Defense Proteins/Peptides (HDPs), can inhibit SARS-CoV-2, paving the way for the potential clinical use of these molecules as therapeutic options. In this manuscript, we describe the potent antiviral activity exerted by brilacidin\u2014a de novo designed synthetic small molecule that captures the biological properties of HDPs\u2014on SARS-CoV-2 in a human lung cell line (Calu-3) and a monkey cell line (Vero). These data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 inhibition in these cell culture models is primarily a result of the impact of brilacidin on viral entry and its disruption of viral integrity. Brilacidin has demonstrated synergistic antiviral activity when combined with remdesivir. Collectively, our data demonstrate that brilacidin exerts potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 and thus supports brilacidin as a promising COVID-19 drug candidate.","Pro-inflammatory immune responses are necessary for effective pathogen clearance, but cause severe tissue damage if not shut down in a timely manner1,2. Excessive complement and IFN-\u03b3-associated responses are known drivers of immunopathogenesis3 and are among the most highly induced immune programs in hyper-inflammatory SARS-CoV2 lung infection4. The molecular mechanisms that govern orderly shutdown and retraction of these responses remain poorly understood. Here, we show that complement triggers contraction of IFN-\u03b3 producing CD4+ T helper (Th) 1 cell responses by inducing expression of the vitamin D (VitD) receptor (VDR) and CYP27B1, the enzyme that activates VitD, permitting T cells to both activate and respond to VitD. VitD then initiates the transition from pro-inflammatory IFN-\u03b3+ Th1 cells to suppressive IL-10+ Th1 cells. This process is primed by dynamic changes in the epigenetic landscape of CD4+ T cells, generating superenhancers and recruiting c-JUN and BACH2, a key immunoregulatory transcription factor5\u20137. Accordingly, cells in psoriatic skin treated with VitD increased BACH2 expression, and BACH2 haplo-insufficient CD4+ T cells were defective in IL-10 production. As proof-of-concept, we show that CD4+ T cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of patients with COVID-19 are Th1-skewed and that VDR is among the top regulators of genes induced by SARS-CoV2. Importantly, genes normally down-regulated by VitD were de-repressed in CD4+ BALF T cells of COVID-19, indicating that the VitD-driven shutdown program is impaired in this setting. The active metabolite of VitD, alfacalcidol, and cortico-steroids were among the top predicted pharmaceuticals that could normalize SARS-CoV2 induced genes. These data indicate that adjunct therapy with VitD in the context of other immunomodulatory drugs may be a beneficial strategy to dampen hyperinflammation in severe COVID-19.","An imbalance between extracellular and intracellular fluid osmolality causes osmotic stress and affects cellular homeostasis. Recent research suggests that osmotic stress is also associated with various innate and adaptive immune responses. Here we present the surprising finding that osmolality tightly controls the expression of cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide (CAMP) in human macrophages. CAMP expression is strongly upregulated under hyperosmotic conditions and downregulated under hypoosmotic conditions. We also provide evidence that this osmolality-mediated antimicrobial response is dependent on nuclear factor of activated T-cells 5 (NFAT5) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38. Finally, Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation inhibits osmolality-mediated expression of CAMP in human macrophages, suggesting that this osmolality-dependent regulation of CAMP is more relevant under homeostatic conditions, rather than during acute infections. This study expands our knowledge of the regulation of human antimicrobial peptides and highlights osmolality as an important and independent factor shaping host innate immune homeostasis.","The initiation of lactation challenges the ability of the modern lactating cow to maintain calcium homeostasis, and typically results in a drop in blood calcium levels; leading to mobilization of calcium reserves from skeletal stores. As such, the recommendation to provide supplemental calcium at parturition to older cows has become an industry-standard practice. Mature cows were treated at calving and 12 hours later with either the novel calcium bolus (NB), or a commercially available calcium bolus (CB). Blood was collected from animals at 0, 1, 6, 12, 13, and 24 hours following calving, and the resulting serum samples were analyzed. Overall, there was no statistical difference between the NB and CB groups for blood calcium levels within the first 24 hours following parturition (P = 0.50). Cows in both groups experienced a significant increase in serum calcium by 1 hour after parturition; however, this increase was not sustained through subsequent sampling times. This pilot study demonstrates that both boluses have a similar effect in the elevation of blood calcium.","The vitamin A metabolite all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA; tretinoin) has anticancer potential; however, lack of clinical success has prevented its approval for solid tumors. Herein, we propose combining low-dose ATRA preconditioning with fimaporfin-based photodynamic therapy (ATRA+PDT) for the treatment of solid cancers. Compared to monotherapies, ATRA+PDT induced synergistic cytotoxic responses including promotion of apoptosis in colon and breast carcinoma cell lines. In human HT-29 colon cancer cells, the effect of ATRA+PDT on gene expression was evaluated by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). The unfolded protein response (UPR) and retinoic acid-mediated apoptosis signaling were predicted as strongly activated canonical pathways after ATRA+PDT compared to PDT. During the first 20 days post-ATRA+PDT, we obtained significant anti-tumor responses in HT-29 xenografts, including complete responses in 2/5 mice. In conclusion, ATRA+PDT represent a novel combination therapy for solid tumors that should be further tested in immunocompetent preclinical models.","Colorectal adenocarcinomas (CRC) are one of the most commonly diagnosed tumors worldwide. Colorectal adenocarcinomas primarily metastasize into the liver and (less often) into the peritoneum. Patients suffering from CRC-liver metastasis (CRC-LM) typically present with a dismal overall survival compared to non-metastasized CRC patients. The metastasis process and metastasis-promoting factors in patients with CRC are under intensive debate. However, CRC studies investigating the proteome biology are lacking. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue specimens provide a valuable resource for comprehensive proteomic studies of a broad variety of clinical malignancies. The presented pilot study compares the proteome of primary CRC and patient-matched CRC-LM. The applied protocol allows a reproducible and straightforward identification and quantification of over 2,600 proteins within the dissected tumorous tissue. Subsequent unsupervised clustering reveals distinct proteome biologies of the primary CRC and the corresponding CRC-LM. Statistical analysis yields multiple differentially abundant proteins in either primary CRC or their corresponding liver metastases. A more detailed analysis of dysregulated biological processes suggests an active immune response in the liver metastases, including several proteins of the complement system. Proteins with structural roles, e.g. cytoskeleton organization or cell junction assembly appear to be less prominent in liver metastases as compared to primary CRC. Immunohistochemistry corroborates proteomic high expression levels of metabolic proteins in CRC-LM. We further assessed how the in vitro inhibition of two in CRC-LM enriched metabolic proteins affected cell proliferation and chemosensitivity. The presented proteomic investigation in a small clinical cohort promotes a more comprehensive understanding of the distinct proteome biology of primary CRC and their corresponding liver metastases.","Cytoplasmic lipid droplets are highly dynamic storage organelles; their rapid synthesis, expansion, and degradation, as well as their varied interactions with other organelles allow cells to maintain lipid homeostasis. While the molecular details of lipid droplet dynamics are currently a very active area of investigation, this work has been primarily performed in cultured cells and in vitro systems. By taking advantage of the powerful transgenic and in vivo imaging opportunities afforded by the zebrafish model system, we have built a suite of tools to allow lipid droplets to be studied in real-time from the subcellular to the whole organism level. Fluorescently-tagging the lipid droplet associated proteins, perilipin 2 and perilipin 3, in the endogenous loci, permits visualization of lipid droplets in the intestine, liver, lateral line and adipose tissue. Using these transgenic lines we have found that perilipin 3 is rapidly loaded on intestinal lipid droplets following a high fat meal and then largely replaced by perilipin 2 a few hours later. These powerful new tools will facilitate studies on the role of lipid droplets in different tissues and under different genetic and physiological manipulations.","Cardiac pathologies are characterized by intense remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) that eventually leads to heart failure. Cardiomyocytes respond to the ensuing biomechanical stress by re-expressing fetal contractile proteins via transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes, like alternative splicing (AS). Here, we demonstrate that the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C (hnRNPC) is upregulated and relocates to the sarcomeric Z-disk upon ECM pathological remodeling. We show that this is an active site of localized translation, where the ribonucleoprotein associates to the translation machinery. Alterations in hnRNPC expression and localization can be mechanically determined and affect the AS of numerous mRNAs involved in mechanotransduction and cardiovascular diseases, like Hippo pathway effector YAP1. We propose that cardiac ECM remodeling serves as a switch in RNA metabolism by impacting an associated regulatory protein of the spliceosome apparatus. These findings offer new insights on the mechanism of mRNAs homeostasis mechanoregulation in pathological conditions.","While screening our in-house 1,072 marketed drugs for their ability to extend the lifespan using Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) as an animal model, crotamiton (N-ethyl-o-crotonotoluidide) showed anti-aging activity and was selected for further structural optimization. After replacing the ortho-methyl of crotamiton with ortho-fluoro, crotamiton derivative JM03 was obtained and showed better activity in terms of lifespan-extension and stress resistance than crotamiton. It was further explored that JM03 extended the lifespan of C. elegans through osmotic avoidance abnormal-9 (OSM-9). Besides, JM03 improves the ability of nematode to resist oxidative stress and hypertonic stress through OSM-9, but not osm-9/capsaicin receptor related-2 (OCR-2). Then the inhibition of OSM-9 by JM03 reduces the aggregation of Q35 in C. elegans via upregulating the genes associated with proteostasis. SKN-1 signaling was also found to be activated after JM03 treatment, which might contribute to proteostasis, stress resistance and lifespan extension. In summary, this study explored a new small molecule derived from crotamiton, which has efficient anti-oxidative, anti-hypertonic and anti-aging effects, and could further lead to promising application prospects.","Serine/threonine protein kinase C (PKC) is activated by diacylglycerol that is released from membrane lipids by phospholipase C in response to activation of G protein-coupled receptors or receptor tyrosine kinases. PKC isoforms are particularly relevant for proliferation and differentiation of cells including osteoblasts. Osteoblasts/osteocytes produce fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a hormone regulating renal phosphate and vitamin D handling. PKC activates NF\u03baB, a transcription factor complex controlling FGF23 expression. Here, we analyzed the impact of PKC on FGF23 synthesis. Fgf23 expression was analyzed by qRT-PCR in UMR106 osteoblastlike cells and in IDG-SW3 osteocytes. Phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (PMA), a PKC activator, up-regulated Fgf23 expression. In contrast, PKC inhibitors calphostin C, G\u00f66976, sotrastaurin and ruboxistaurin supressed Fgf23 gene expression. NF\u03baB inhibitor withaferin A abolished the stimulatory effect of PMA on Fgf23. PKC is a powerful regulator of FGF23 synthesis, an effect which is at least partly mediated by NF\u03baB.","Glucagon secretion is perturbed in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes (T1D, T2D) the pathophysiological changes at the level of individual pancreatic alpha cells are still largely obscure. Using recently-curated single-cell RNA data from human donors with either T1D or T2D and appropriate controls, we leveraged alpha cell transcriptomic alterations consistent with both common and discrete pathways. Firstly, altered expression of genes associated with alpha cell identity (ARX, MAFB) was common to both diseases. In contrast, increased expression of cytokine-regulated genes and genes involved in glucagon biosynthesis and processing were apparent in T1D, whereas mitochondrial genes associated with reactive oxygen species generation (COX7B, NQO2) were dysregulated in alpha cells from T2D patients. Conversely, T1D alpha cells displayed alterations in genes associated with autoimmune-induced ER stress (ERLEC1, HSP90) whilst those from T2D patients showed changes in glycolytic and citrate cycle genes (LDH, PDHB, PDK4) which were unaffected in T1D. These findings suggest that despite some similarities related to loss-of-function, the alterations of alpha cells present important disease-specific signatures, suggesting that they are secondary to the main pathogenic events characteristic to each disease, namely immune-mediated-or metabolic-mediated-stress in respectively T1D and T2D.","The complex nature of the transcriptional networks underlying addictive behaviors suggests intricate cooperation between diverse gene regulation mechanisms that go beyond canonical activity-dependent pathways. Here we implicate in this process a novel nuclear receptor transcription factor, Retinoid X Receptor Alpha (RXR\u03b1), which we identified bioinformatically as associated with addiction-like behaviors. In the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of male and female mice, we show that, while its own expression remains unaltered after cocaine exposure, RXR\u03b1 controls plasticity- and addiction-relevant transcriptional programs in both dopamine receptor D1- and D2-expressing medium spiny neurons, which in turn modulate intrinsic excitability and synaptic activity of these NAc cell types. Behaviorally, bidirectional viral and pharmacological manipulation of RXR\u03b1 regulates drug reward sensitivity in both non-operant and operant paradigms. Together, this study demonstrates a key role for NAc RXR\u03b1 in promoting drug addiction, and paves the way for future studies of rexinoid signaling in psychiatric disease states.","Melanoma is notorious for its cellular heterogeneity, which is at least partly due to its ability to transition between alternate cell states. Similarly to EMT, melanoma cells with a melanocytic phenotype can switch to a mesenchymal-like phenotype. However, scattered emerging evidence indicates that additional, intermediate state(s) may exist. In order to search for such new melanoma states and decipher their underlying gene regulatory network (GRN), we extensively studied ten patient-derived melanoma cultures by single-cell RNA-seq of &gt;39,000 cells. Although each culture exhibited a unique transcriptome, we identified shared gene regulatory networks that underlie the extreme melanocytic and mesenchymal cell states, as well as one (stable) intermediate state. The intermediate state was corroborated by a distinct open chromatin landscape and governed by the transcription factors EGR3, NFATC2, and RXRG. Single-cell migration assays established that this \u201ctransition\u201d state exhibits an intermediate migratory phenotype. Through a dense time-series sampling of single cells and dynamic GRN inference, we unraveled the sequential and recurrent arrangement of transcriptional programs at play during phenotype switching that ultimately lead to the mesenchymal cell state. We provide the scRNA-Seq data with 39,263 melanoma cells on our SCope platform and the ATAC-seq data on a UCSC hub to jointly serve as a resource for the melanoma field. Together, this exhaustive analysis of melanoma cell state diversity indicates that additional states exists between the two extreme melanocytic and mesenchymal-like states. The GRN we identified may serve as a new putative target to prevent the switch to mesenchymal cell state and thereby, acquisition of metastatic and drug resistant potential.","The gut microbiome has been established as a key environmental factor to health. Genetic influences on the gut microbiome have been reported, yet, doubts remain as to the significance of genetic associations. Here, we provide shotgun data for whole genome and whole metagenome from a Chinese cohort, identifying no less than 20% genetic contribution to the gut microbiota. Using common variants-, rare variants- and copy number variations (CNVs)-based association analyses, we identified abundant signals associated with the gut microbiome especially in metabolic, neurological and immunological functions. The controversial concept of enterotypes may have a genetic attribute, with the top 2 loci explaining 11% of the Prevotella-Bacteroides variances. Stratification according to gender led to the identification of differential associations in males and females. Genetically encoded responses to ectopic presence of oral bacteria in the gut appear to be a common theme in a number of diseases investigated by MWAS (Metagenome-wide association studies). Our two-stage M-GWAS (Microbiome genome-wide association studies) on a total of 1295 individuals unequivocally illustrates that neither microbiome nor GWAS studies could overlook one another in our quest for a better understanding of human health and diseases.","Extracellular calcium (Ca2+) and store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) govern homeostasis in the mammalian epidermis. Multiple microRNAs (miRNA) also regulate epidermal differentiation, and raised external Ca2+ modulates the expression of several such miRNAs in keratinocytes. However, little is known about the regulation of miR-184 in keratinocytes or the roles of miR-184 in keratinocyte differentiation. Here we report exogenous Ca2+ stimulates miR-184 expression in primary epidermal keratinocytes and that this occurs in a SOCE-dependent manner. Levels of miR-184 were raised by about 30-fold after exposure to 1.5 mM Ca2+ for 5 days. In contrast, neither phorbol ester nor 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 had any effect on miR-184 levels. Pharmacologic and genetic inhibitors of SOCE abrogated Ca2+-dependent miR-184 induction by 70% or more. Ectopic miR-184 inhibited keratinocyte proliferation and led to a 4-fold increase in the expression of involucrin, a marker of early keratinocyte differentiation. Exogenous miR-184 also triggered a 3-fold rise in levels of cyclin E and doubled the levels of \u03b3H2AX, a marker of DNA double strand breaks. The p21 cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, which supports keratinocyte growth arrest, was also induced by miR-184. Together our findings point to a SOCE:miR-184 pathway that targets a cyclin E/DNA damage regulatory node to facilitate keratinocyte differentiation.","Cardiomyocyte (CM) proliferative potential varies considerably across species. While lower vertebrates and neonatal mammals retain robust capacities for CM proliferation, adult mammalian CMs lose proliferative potential due to cell-cycle withdrawal and polyploidization, failing to mount a proliferative response to regenerate lost CMs after cardiac injury. The decline of murine CM proliferative potential occurs in the neonatal period when the endocrine system undergoes drastic changes for adaptation to extrauterine life. We recently demonstrated that thyroid hormone (TH) signaling functions as a primary factor driving CM proliferative potential loss in vertebrates. Whether other hormonal pathways govern this process remains largely unexplored. Here we showed that agonists of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and vitamin D receptor (VDR) suppressed neonatal CM proliferation in vitro. We next examined CM nucleation and proliferation in mutant mice lacking GR or VDR specifically in CMs, but we observed no difference between mutant and control littermates. Additionally, we generated compound mutant mice that lack GR or VDR and express dominant-negative TH receptor alpha in their CMs, and similarly observed no increase in CM proliferative potential compared to dominant-negative TH receptor alpha mice alone. Thus, although GR and VDR activation in cultured CMs is sufficient to inhibit CM proliferation, they seem to be dispensable for CM cell-cycle exit and binucleation in vivo. In addition, given the recent report that VDR activation in zebrafish promotes CM proliferation and tissue regeneration, our results suggest distinct roles of VDR in zebrafish and rodent CM cell-cycle regulation.","Changes in a few key transcriptional regulators can lead to different biological states, including cell activation and differentiation, and diseases. Extracting the key gene regulators governing a biological state allows us to gain mechanistic insights and can further help in translational research. Most current tools perform pathway/GO enrichment analysis to identify key genes and regulators but tend to overlook the regulatory interactions between genes and proteins. Here we present RegEnrich, an open-source Bioconductor R package, which combines differential expression analysis, data-driven gene regulatory network inference, enrichment analysis, and gene regulator ranking to identify key regulators using gene/protein expression profiling data. By benchmarking using multiple gene expression datasets of gene silencing studies, we found that RegEnrich using the GSEA method to rank the regulators performed the best to retrieve the key regulators. Further, RegEnrich was applied to 21 publicly available datasets on in vitro interferon-stimulation of different cell types. We found that not only IRF and STAT transcription factor families played an important role in cells responding to IFN, but also several ETS transcription factor family members, such as ELF1 and ETV7, are highly associated with IFN stimulations. Collectively, RegEnrich can accurately identify key gene regulators from the cells under different biological states in a data-driven manner, which can be valuable in mechanistically studying cell differentiation, cell response to drug stimulation, disease development, and ultimately drug development.","Background Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a lethal muscle disease detected in approximately 1:5000 male births. DMD is caused by mutations in the DMD gene, encoding a critical protein that link the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix in skeletal and cardiac muscles. The primary consequence of the disrupted link between the extracellular matrix and the myofiber actin cytoskeleton is thought to involve sarcolemma destabilization, perturbation of Ca+2 homeostasis, activation of proteases, mitochondrial damage and tissue degeneration. A recently emphasized secondary aspect of the dystrophic process is a progressive metabolic change of the dystrophic tissue; however, the mechanism and nature of the metabolic dysregulation is yet poorly understood. In this study, we characterized a molecular mechanism of metabolic perturbation in DMD.","Osteoporosis in advanced cholestatic and end-stage liver disease is related to low bone formation. Previous studies have demonstrated the deleterious consequences of lithocholic acid (LCA) and bilirubin on osteoblastic cells. These effects are partially or completely neutralized by ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). We have assessed the differential gene expression of osteoblastic cells under different culture conditions. The experiments were performed in human osteosarcoma cells (Saos-2) cultured with LCA 10 \u03bcM), bilirubin (50 \u03bcM) or UDCA (10 and 100 \u03bcM) at 2 and 24 hours. Expression of 87 genes related to bone metabolism and other signalling pathways were assessed by TaqMan micro fluidic cards. Several genes were up-regulated by LCA, most of them pro-apoptotic (BAX, BCL10, BCL2L13, BCL2L14), but also MGP (matrix Gla protein), BGLAP (osteocalcin), SPP1 (osteopontin) and CYP24A1, and down-regulated bone morphogenic protein genes (BMP3 and BMP4) and DKK1 (Dickkopf-related protein 1). Parallel effects were observed with bilirubin, which up-regulated apoptotic genes and CSF2 (colony-stimulating factor 2) and down-regulated antiapoptotic genes (BCL2 and BCL2L1), BMP3, BMP4 and RUNX2. UDCA 100 \u03bcM had specific consequences since differential expression was observed, up-regulating BMP2, BMP4, BMP7, CALCR (calcitonin receptor), SPOCK3 (osteonectin), BGLAP (osteocalcin) and SPP1 (osteopontin), and down-regulating pro-apoptotic genes. Furthermore, most of the differential expression changes induced by both LCA and bilirubin were partially or completely neutralized by UDCA. Conclusion: Our observations reveal novel target genes, whose regulation by retained substances of cholestasis may provide additional insights into the pathogenesis of osteoporosis in cholestatic and end-stage liver diseases.","Matrix stiffness is a central regulator of fibroblast function. However, the transcriptional mechanisms linking matrix stiffness to changes in fibroblast phenotype are incompletely understood. Here, we evaluated the effect of matrix stiffness on genome-wide chromatin accessibility in freshly-isolated lung fibroblasts using assay for transposase-accessible chromatin followed by sequencing (ATAC-seq). We found higher matrix stiffness profoundly increased global chromatin accessibility relative to lower matrix stiffness, and these alterations were in close genomic proximity to known pro-fibrotic gene programs. Motif analysis of these regulated genomic loci identified ZNF416 as a putative mediator of fibroblast stiffness responses. Similarly, motif analysis of the promoters of differentially expressed genes observed in freshly sorted fibroblasts from an experimental bleomycin lung fibrosis model also identified ZNF416 as a putative mediator of in vivo fibroblast activation. Genome occupancy analysis using chromatin-immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) confirmed that ZNF416 occupies a broad range of genes implicated in fibroblast activation and tissue-fibrosis, with relatively little overlap in genomic occupancy with other mechanoresponsive and pro-fibrotic transcriptional regulators. Using loss and gain of function studies we demonstrated that ZNF416 plays a critical role in fibroblast proliferation, extracellular matrix synthesis and contractile function. Together these observations identify ZNF416 as novel mechano-activated transcriptional regulator of fibroblast biology.","The dynamic regulation of \u03b2-cell abundance is poorly understood. Since chromatin remodeling plays critical roles in liver regeneration, these mechanisms could be generally important for regeneration in other tissues. Here we show that the ARID1A mammalian SWI/SNF complex subunit is a critical regulator of \u03b2-cell regeneration. Arid1a is highly expressed in quiescent \u03b2-cells but is physiologically suppressed when \u03b2-cells proliferate during pregnancy or after pancreas resection. Whole-body Arid1a knockout mice were protected against streptozotocin induced diabetes. Cell-type and temporally specific genetic dissection showed that \u03b2-cell specific Arid1a deletion could potentiate \u03b2-cell regeneration in multiple contexts. Transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling of mutant islets revealed increased Neuregulin-ERBB-NR4A signaling. Functionally, ERBB3 overexpression in \u03b2-cells was sufficient to protect against diabetes, and chemical inhibition of ERBB or NR4A was able to block increased regeneration associated with Arid1a loss. mSWI/SNF complex activity is a barrier to \u03b2-cell regeneration in physiologic and disease states.","In recent years there has been growing evidence regarding the effect of microbiota on the skeletal growth and homeostasis. Here we present, for the first time, accelerated longitudinal and radial bone growth in young (7-week-old) germ-free male rats after short-term exposure to a newly established gut microbiota. Changes in bone mass and structure were analyzed after 10 days following the onset of colonization through cohousing with conventional rats and revealed unprecedented acceleration of bone accrual in cortical and trabecular compartments, increased bone tissue mineral density, improved proliferation and hypertrophy of growth plate chondrocytes, bone lengthening, and preferential deposition of periosteal bone in tibia diaphysis. In addition, the number of small-in-size adipocytes increased, while the number of megakaryocytes decreased, in the bone marrow of conventionalized germ-free rats. The observed changes in bone status were paralleled with a positive shift in microbiota composition towards short chain fatty acids (SCFA)-producing microbes, which reflected a dramatic increase in cecal concentration of SCFA, specifically butyrate. Further, reconstitution of the host holobiont increased hepatic expression of IGF-1 and its circulating levels, implicating an involvement of the somatotropic axis. Increased serum levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D and alkaline phosphatase pointed toward an active process of bone formation. The acute stimulatory effect on bone growth occurred independently of body mass increase and resembled reversal of dysbiosis in adolescence, which is marked by rapid skeletal expansion. These findings may help in developing microbiota-based therapeutics to combat bone related disorders resulting from hormonal defects and/or malnutrition in children and adolescence.","Testing for associations in big data faces the problem of multiple comparisons, with true signals buried inside the noise of all associations queried. This is particularly true in genetic association studies where a substantial proportion of the variation of human phenotypes is driven by numerous genetic variants of small effect. The current strategy to improve power to identify these weak associations consists of applying standard marginal statistical approaches and increasing study sample sizes. While successful, this approach does not leverage the environmental and genetic factors shared between the multiple phenotypes collected in contemporary cohorts. Here we develop a method that improves the power of detecting associations when a large number of correlated variables have been measured on the same samples. Our analyses over real and simulated data provide direct support that large sets of correlated variables can be leveraged to achieve dramatic increases in statistical power equivalent to a two or even three folds increase in sample size.","Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is one of the most common endocrine and metabolic conditions in children. In fact, this disease in children and adolescents has been increasing exponentially, with Kuwait being ranked second highest in the world regarding the number of T1D incidences. Kuwait is an oil-rich country known for its strong sense of familism, affiliative obedience, and filial obligation. Therefore, a familial study of this disease may disclose certain causative agents responsible for passing the disease on to subsequent generations.","L-DOPA Induced Dyskinesia (LID) is associated with prolonged L-DOPA therapy. Vitamin-D receptor modulation improves motor-cognitive deficit in experimental LID Parkinsonism. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the mechanism underlying the anti-dyskinetic potential of Vitamin D3 (VD3). Dyskinesia was induced by chronic L-DOPA administration in 6-OHDA lesioned male C57BL6 mice. The experimental groups (Dyskinesia, Dyskinesia/VD3, and Dyskinesia/Amantadine) and controls were challenged with L-DOPA to determine the abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) score during 14 days of VD3 (30 mg/kg) or Amantadine (40 mg/kg) treatment. Global behavioral Axial, Limb &amp; Orolingual (ALO) AIMs were scored for 1 min at every 20 mins interval, over a duration of 100 mins on days 1,3,7,11 and 14 of treatment. Thereafter, brain samples were collected and processed for immunoblotting to assess striatal expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), monoamine oxidase (MAO), cathecol-o-methyl transferase (COMT), dopamine decarboxylase (DDC), CD11b, BAX, P47phox, and IL-1\u03b2. VD3 significantly attenuated ALO AIMs only on days 11 &amp; 14, with maximal reduction of 32.7% compared with dyskinetic mice but had no effect on days 1, 3 &amp; 7, while amantadine decreased AIMs all through days 1 to 14 with maximal reduction of 64.5%. TH and MAO-B expression were not significantly different across the groups. DDC was significantly suppressed in dyskinetic mice vs control (p&lt;0.001) but remained unchanged in VD3 mice vs dyskinetic mice. COMT was upregulated in the dyskinetic group vs control (p&lt;0.01) and attenuated in VD3 mice (p&lt;0.05) compared to the dyskinetic group. Interestingly, VD3 inhibited significantly (p&lt;0.01) oxidative stress (p47phox), apoptosis (BAX), inflammation (IL-1\u03b2), and microglial activation (CD11b) in dyskinetic mice. Overall, we find that the anti-dyskinetic effects of VD3 is associated with modulation of striatal oxidative stress, microglial responses, inflammation, and apoptotic signaling.","Testosterone is a hormone that plays a key role in carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism. Testosterone deficiency is associated with multiple comorbidities, e.g., metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Despite its importance in many metabolic pathways, the mechanisms by which it controls metabolism are not fully understood. The present study investigated the short-term metabolic changes of pharmacologically induced castration and testosterone supplementation in healthy young males. Thirty subjects were submitted to testosterone depletion (TD) followed by testosterone supplementation (TS). Plasma samples were collected three times corresponding to basal, low, and restored testosterone levels. An untargeted metabolomics study was performed by liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) to monitor the metabolic changes induced by the altered hormone levels. Our results demonstrated that TD is associated with major metabolic changes partially restored by TS. Carnitine and amino acid metabolism were the metabolic pathways most impacted by variations in testosterone. Furthermore, our results also indicate that LH and FSH might strongly alter the plasma levels of indoles and lipids, especially glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids. Our results demonstrate major metabolic changes induced by low testosterone that may be important for understanding the mechanisms behind the association of testosterone deficiency and its comorbidities.","In cochlear outer hair cells (OHCs), a network of Ca2+ channels, pumps and Ca2+-binding proteins (CaBPs) regulates the localization, spread, and magnitude of free Ca2+ ions. During early postnatal development, OHCs express three prominent mobile EF-hand CaBPs: oncomodulin (OCM), \u03b1-parvalbumin (APV) and sorcin. We have previously shown that deletion of Ocm (Ocm-/-) gives rise to progressive cochlear dysfunction in young adult mice. Here, we show that changes in Ca2+ signaling begin early in postnatal development of Ocm-/- mice. While mutant OHCs exhibit normal electrophysiological profiles compared to controls, their intracellular Ca2+ signaling is altered. The onset of OCM expression at postnatal day 3 (P3) causes a developmental change in KCl-induced Ca2+ transients in OHCs and leads to slower KCl-induced Ca2+ transients than those elicited in cells from Ocm-/- littermates. We compared OCM buffering kinetics with other CaBPs in animal models and cultured cells. In a double knockout of Ocm and Apv (Ocm-/-;Apv-/-), mutant OHCs show even faster Ca2+ kinetics, suggesting that APV may also contribute to early postnatal Ca2+ signaling. In transfected HEK293T cells, OCM slows Ca2+ kinetics more so than either APV or sorcin. We conclude that OCM controls the intracellular Ca2+ environment by lowering the amount of freely available [Ca2+]i in OHCs and in transfected HEK293T cells. We propose that OCM plays an important role in shaping the development of early OHC Ca2+ signals through its inimitable Ca2+ buffering capacity.","Cranial growth and development affects the closely related traits of head circumference (HC) and intracranial volume (ICV). Here we model the developmental genetic architecture of HC, showing this is genetically stable and correlated with genetic determinants of ICV. Investigating up to 46,000 children and adults of European descent, we identify association with final HC and/or final ICV+HC at 9 novel common and low-frequency loci, illustrating that genetic variation from a wide allele frequency spectrum contributes to cranial growth. The largest effects are reported for low-frequency variants within TP53, with 0.5 cm wider heads in increaser-allele carriers versus non-carriers during mid-childhood.","The pathophysiology of endometriosis (EM) is an excellent example of immune dysfunction, reminiscent of tumor microenvironment as well. Here, we report that an interplay between C3 and mast cells (MCs) is involved in the pathogenesis of ectopic EM. C3 is at the epicenter of the regulatory feed forward loop, amplifying the inflammatory microenvironment, in which the MCs are protagonists. Thus, C3 can be considered a marker of EM and its local synthesis can promote the engraftment of the endometriotic cysts. We generated a murine model of EM via injection of minced uterine tissue from a donor mouse, into the peritoneum of the recipient mice. The wild type mice showed greater amount of cyst formation in the peritoneum compared to C3 knock-out mice. This study offers an opportunity for novel therapeutic intervention in EM, a difficult to treat gynecological condition.","Estrogen receptor \u03b2 (ER\u03b2) was first identified in the rodent prostate and is abundantly expressed in human and rodent prostate epithelium, stroma, immune cells and endothelium of the blood vessels. In the prostates of mice with inactivated ER\u03b2, mutant phenotypes include epithelial hyperplasia and increased expression of androgen receptor (AR)-regulated genes, most of which are also upregulated in prostate cancer (PCa). ER\u03b2 is expressed in both basal and luminal cells in the prostate while AR is expressed in luminal but not in the basal cell layer which harbors the prostate stem cells. To investigate the mechanisms of action of ER\u03b2 and its potential cross-talk with AR, we used RNA-seq to study the effects of estradiol or the synthetic ligand, LY3201, in AR-positive LNCaP PCa cells which had been engineered to express ER\u03b2. Transcriptomic analysis indicated relatively few changes in gene expression with ER\u03b2 overexpression, but robust responses following ligand treatments. There is significant overlap of responsive genes between the two ligands, as well as ligand-specific alterations. Gene set analysis of down-regulated genes identified an enrichment of androgen-responsive genes, such as FKBP5, CAMKK2, and TBC1D4. Consistently, AR transcript, protein levels, and transcriptional activity were down-regulated following ER\u03b2 activation. In agreement with this, we find that the phosphorylation of the CAMKK2 target, AMPK, was repressed by ligand-activated ER\u03b2. Down-regulation of TBC1D4, a major regulator of glucose uptake in prostate, indicates that ER\u03b2 is changing glucose metabolism in the prostate. These findings suggest that ER\u03b2-mediated signaling pathways are involved in the negative regulation of AR expression and activity, thus supporting a tumor suppressive role for ER\u03b2 in PCa.","To maintain body homeostasis, endocrine systems must detect and integrate a multitude of blood-borne peripheral signals. This is mediated by specialized permeable pores in the endothelial membrane, dubbed fenestrae. Plasmalemma vesicles-associated protein (Plvap) is located in the fenestral diaphragm and is thought play a role in the selective passage of proteins through the fenestrae. However, this suggested function has yet to be demonstrated directly. Here, we studied the development of fenestrated capillaries in a major neuroendocrine interface between the blood and brain, namely the hypophysis. Using a transgenic permeability biosensor to visualize the vascular excretion of a genetically tagged plasma protein (DBP-EGFP), we show that the developmental acquisition of vascular permeability is associated with differential expression of zebrafish plvap orthologs in the hypophysis versus brain. Ultrastructural analysis of the hypophyseal vasculature revealed that plvapb mutants display deficiencies in fenestral and stomatal diaphragms as well as increased density of fenestrae, but not of caveolae. Measurements of DBP-EGFP dynamics in live plvapb mutant larvae provided a direct proof that Plvap limits the rate of blood-borne protein passage through fenestrated endothelia. Overall, we present the regulatory role of Plvap in the development of blood-borne protein detection machinery in a major neuroendocrine interface between the brain and the general circulation.","Background and objectives In an effort to improve donor health, we set out to investigate determinants other than blood donation that increase risk of ID in a healthy population and if they should be implemented into current blood donor selection processes.","Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection is among top ten causes of death worldwide, and the number of drug-resistant strains is increasing. The direct interception of human immune signaling molecules by Mtb remains elusive, limiting drug discovery. Oxysterols and secosteroids regulate both innate and adaptive immune responses. Here we report a functional, structural, and bioinformatics study of Mtb enzymes initiating cholesterol catabolism and demonstrated their interrelation with human immunity. We show that these enzymes metabolize human immune oxysterol messengers. Rv2266 \u2013 the most potent among them \u2013 can also metabolize vitamin D3 (VD3) derivatives. High-resolution structures show common patterns of sterols binding and reveal a site for oxidative attack during catalysis. Finally, we designed a compound that binds and inhibits three studied proteins. The compound shows activity against Mtb H37Rv residing in macrophages. Our findings contribute to molecular understanding of suppression of immunity and suggest that Mtb has its own transformation system resembling the human phase I drug-metabolizing system.","Background Seasonal disease outbreaks are perennial features of human infectious disease but the factors generating these patterns are unclear. In animal studies, seasonal and circadian (daily) rhythms in immune function generate periodicity in vulnerability to disease, although it is not known whether the same applies to humans. Making use of extensive data from the UK Biobank cohort, we investigate seasonal and daytime variability in multiple immune parameters (inflammatory markers, white blood cell counts and antibody titres), and test for associations with a wide range of environmental and lifestyle factors.","COVID-19 vaccines based on the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 have been developed that appear to be largely successful in stopping infection. However, vaccine escape variants might arise leading to a re-emergence of COVID. In anticipation of such a scenario, the identification of repurposed drugs that stop SARS-CoV-2 replication could have enormous utility in stemming the disease. Here, using a nano-luciferase tagged version of the virus (SARS-CoV-2- DOrf7a-NLuc) to quantitate viral load, we evaluated a range of human cell types for their ability to be infected and support replication of the virus, and performed a screen of 1971 FDA-approved drugs. Hepatocytes, kidney glomerulus, and proximal tubule cells were particularly effective in supporting SARS-CoV-2 replication, which is in- line with reported proteinuria and liver damage in patients with COVID-19. We identified 35 drugs that reduced viral replication in Vero and human hepatocytes when treated prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection and found amodiaquine, atovaquone, bedaquiline, ebastine, LY2835219, manidipine, panobinostat, and vitamin D3 to be effective in slowing SARS-CoV-2 replication in human cells when used to treat infected cells. In conclusion, our study has identified strong candidates for drug repurposing, which could prove powerful additions to the treatment of COVID.","Prolonged exposure to glucocorticoid stress hormones precipitates mood and cognitive disorders. We identified arginine and glutamate rich 1 (ARGLU1) in a screen for new modulators of glucocorticoid signaling in the CNS. Biochemical studies found that the glutamate rich C-terminus coactivates the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and the arginine rich N-terminus interacts with splicing factors and RNA. RNA-seq of neuronal cells \u00b1siARGLU1found significant changes in the expression and alternative splicing of distinct genes involved in neurogenesis. Loss of ARGLU1 was embryonic lethal in mice, and knockdown in zebrafish caused neurodevelopmental and heart defects. Treatment with dexamethasone, a GR activator, also induced changes in the pattern of alternatively spliced genes, highlighting an underappreciated global mechanism of glucocorticoid action in neuronal cells. Thus, in addition to its basal role, ARGLU1 links glucocorticoid-mediated transcription and alternative splicing in neural cells, providing new avenues from which to investigate the molecular underpinnings of cognitive stress disorders.","INTRODUCTION The rice rat (Oryzomys palustris) is a non-conventional laboratory rodent species used to model some human bone disorders. However, no studies have been conducted to characterize the postcranial skeleton. Therefore, we aimed to investigate age- and gender-related features of the appendicular skeleton of this species.","Electron transfer mediated by metalloproteins drives many biological processes. Rubredoxins are ubiquitous iron-containing electron carriers that play important roles in bacterial adaptation to changing environmental conditions. In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, oxidative and acidic stresses as well as iron starvation induce rubredoxin expression. However, their functions during M. tuberculosis infection is unknown. In the present work, we show that rubredoxin B (RubB) supports catalytic activity of mycobacterial cytochrome P450s, CYP124, CYP125, and CYP142, which are important for bacterial viability and pathogenicity. We solved the crystal structure of RubB and characterized the interaction between RubB and CYPs using site-directed mutagenesis. Mutations that neutralized single charge on the surface of RubB did not dramatically decrease activity of studied CYPs, and isothermal calorimetry (ITC) experiments indicated that interactions are transient and not highly specific. Our findings suggest that a switch from ferredoxins to rubredoxins support CYP activity in M. tuberculosis-infected macrophages. Our electrochemical experiments suggest potential applications of RubB in biotechnology.","The IL-6 has been used for the characterization of the cytokine storm induced by SARS-CoV-2, but so far, no one has found out when and in whom the cytokine storm develops. Our study demonstrates how early and longitudinal clinical-based monitoring and dosing of five markers (C-reactive protein, IL-6, fibrinogen, ferritin and D-dimer) helped to identify who\u2019d developed the cytokine storm. The peak of IL-6 in pg/mL proportionally higher than the peak of CRP in mg/L was sufficient to define the timing of the evolution of cytokine storm syndrome. The administration of antibiotic therapy, anticoagulant therapy and pulse therapy resolved the infection and prevented the progressive deterioration of the lung function of the patients with potential for development of severe COVID-19.","Parathyroid diseases are characterized by dysregulation of calcium homeostasis and alterations in parathyroid hormone (PTH) excretion. The understanding of parathyroid hyperplastic growth and the development of parathyroid-targeted treatment and imaging tracers could benefit from in vitro models. Therefore, we aim to establish stem cell-derived, three-dimensional organoids representing human parathyroid tissue in vitro. Patient-derived hyperplastic parathyroid tissue was dispersed and parathyroid organoids (PTO) were cultured and characterized. PTO-derived cells were shown to exhibit in vitro self-renewal over several passages, indicative of the presence of putative stem cells. Immunofluorescence and RNA-sequencing confirm that PTO phenocopy hyperplastic parathyroid tissue. Exposure of PTO to increasing calcium concentrations and to PTH-lowering drugs resulted in a significantly reduced PTH excretion. Next to this, the PTO showed specific binding of 11C-methionine to the targeted receptor. Additionally, when organoids were incubated with 99mTc-sestamibi, we observed a higher uptake in PTOs from patients with a 99mTc-sestamibi positive scan compared to patients with a negative scan. These data show functionality of PTOs resembling the parathyroid. In conclusion, we present a patient-derived PTO culture, that recapitulates the originating tissue on gene and protein expression and functionality. This PTO model paves the way for future physiology studies and therapeutic target and tracer discovery.","The interleukin 7 receptor (IL7R) is strongly associated with increased risk to develop multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system, and this association is likely driven by upregulation of the soluble isoform of IL7R (sIL7R). Expression of sIL7R is determined by exclusion of the alternative exon 6 from IL7R transcripts, and our previous work revealed that the MS risk allele of the SNP rs6897932 within this exon enhances the expression of sIL7R by promoting exclusion of exon 6. sIL7R potentiates the activity of IL7, leading to enhanced expansion of T cells and increased disability in the Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) murine model of MS. This role in modulating T cell-driven immunity positions sIL7R as an attractive therapeutic target whose expression could be reduced for treatment of MS or increased for treatment of cancers. In this study we identified novel antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that effectively control the inclusion (anti-sIL7R ASOs) or exclusion (pro-sIL7R ASOs) of this exon in a dose-dependent fashion. These ASOs provided excellent control of exon 6 splicing and sIL7R secretion in human primary CD4+ T cells. Supporting their potential for therapeutic targeting, we showed that lead anti-sIL7R ASOs correct the enhanced exon 6 exclusion imposed by the MS risk allele of rs6897932, whereas lead pro-sIL7R ASOs phenocopy it. The data presented here form the foundation for future pre-clinical studies that will test the therapeutic potential of these ASOs in MS and immuno-oncology.","Health systems are stewards of patient electronic health record (EHR) data with extraordinarily rich depth and breadth, reflecting thousands of diagnoses and exposures. Measures of genomic variation integrated with EHRs offer a potential strategy to accurately stratify patients for risk profiling and discover new relationships between diagnoses and genomes. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) for common cancers are associated with multiple phenotypes in a Phenome-wide Association Study (PheWAS) conducted in 28,260 unrelated, genotyped patients of recent European ancestry who consented to participate in the Michigan Genomics Initiative, a longitudinal biorepository effort within Michigan Medicine. PRS for 12 cancer traits were calculated using summary statistics from the NHGRI-EBI catalog. A total of 1,711 synthetic case-control studies was used for PheWAS analyses. There were 13,490 (47.7%) patients with at least one cancer diagnosis in this study sample. PRSs exhibited strong association for several cancer traits they were designed for including female breast cancer, prostate cancer, melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and thyroid cancer. Phenome-wide significant associations were observed between PRS and many non-cancer diagnoses. To differentiate PRS associations driven by the primary trait from associations arising through shared genetic risk profiles, the idea of \u201cexclusion PRS PheWAS\u201d was introduced. This approach led to phenome-wide significant associations between a lower risk for hypothyroidism in patients with high thyroid cancer PRS and a higher risk for actinic keratosis in patients with high squamous cell carcinoma PRS after removing all cases of the primary cancer trait. Further analysis of temporal order of the diagnoses improved our understanding of these secondary associations. This is the first comprehensive PheWAS study using PRS instead of a single variant.","Variation at the FADS1/FADS2 gene cluster is functionally associated with differences in lipid metabolism and is often hypothesized to reflect adaptation to an agricultural diet. Here, we test the evidence for this relationship using both modern and ancient DNA data. We show that almost all the inhabitants of Europe carried the ancestral allele until the derived allele was introduced approximately 8,500 years ago by Early Neolithic farming populations. However, we also show that it was not under strong selection in these populations. We find that this allele, and other proposed agricultural adaptations at LCT/MCM6 and SLC22A4, were not strongly selected until much later, perhaps as late as the Bronze Age. Similarly, increased copy number variation at the salivary amylase gene AMY1 is not linked to the development of agriculture although, in this case, the putative adaptation precedes the agricultural transition. Our analysis shows that selection at the FADS locus was not tightly linked to the initial introduction of agriculture and the Neolithic transition. Further, it suggests that the strongest signals of recent human adaptation in Europe did not coincide with the Neolithic transition but with more recent changes in environment, diet or efficiency of selection due to increases in effective population size.","Treg are critical regulators of immune homeostasis, and increasing evidence demonstrates that environment-driven Treg differentiation into effector (e)Treg is crucial for optimal functioning. However, human Treg programming under inflammatory conditions remains poorly understood. Here, we combine transcriptional and epigenetic profiling to identify the human eTreg core signature. Functional autoimmune inflammation-derived Treg display a unique transcriptional profile characterized by upregulation of both a core Treg (FOXP3, CTLA-4, TIGIT) and effector program (GITR, BLIMP-1, BATF). We identified a specific human eTreg signature that includes the vitamin D receptor (VDR) as predicted key-regulator in eTreg differentiation. H3K27ac/H3K4me1 occupancy revealed pronounced changes in the (super-)enhancer landscape, including enrichment of the binding motif for VDR and BATF. The observed Treg profile showed striking overlap with tumor-infiltrating Treg. Our data demonstrate that human inflammation-derived Treg acquire a specific eTreg profile guided by epigenetic changes. The core eTreg profile is conserved, and fine-tuned by environment-specific adaptations.","Osteoporosis is a metabolic bone disease that occurs during aging, characterized by low bone mineral density (BMD) and a high risk of trauma fracture. While current pharmacological interventions provide symptomatic benefits, they are unsatisfactory and have major side effects. In this study, we used multi-omics data and drug similarity to construct osteoporosis driver signaling networks (ODSN) and drug functional networks (DFN), respectively. By integrating ODSN and DFN with treatment transcriptional responses, we observed 8 drugs that demonstrated strong targeting effects on ODSN. Mendelian Randomization analysis determines the causal effect on BMD using cis-eQTLs of the drug targets and BMD GWAS data. The findings suggested Acebutolol and Amiloride may increase BMD, while Acenocoumarol, Aminocaproic acid and Armodafinil may enhance bone loss. Zebrafish experiments experimentally showed Acebutolol hydrochloride and Amiloride hydrochloride had significant protective effects on osteoporosis in zebrafish embryos induced by Dexamethasone. Also, Acenocoumarol reduced bone mineralization compared with the control group. The findings suggest that the hypertension drugs Acebutolol and Amiloride warrant further investigation in functional mechanistic experiments to evaluate their effectiveness for osteoporosis treatments.","Acne is a multifactorial disease driven by physiological changes occurring during puberty in the pilosebaceous unit (PSU) that leads to sebum overproduction and a dysbiosis involving notably Cutibacterium acnes. These changes in the PSU microenvironment lead to a shift from a homeostatic to an inflammatory state. Indeed, immunohistochemical analyses have revealed that inflammation and lymphocyte infiltration can be detected even in the infraclinical acneic stages, highlighting the importance of the early stages of the disease. In this study, we utilized a robust multi-pronged approach that included flow cytometry, confocal microscopy, and bioinformatics to comprehensively characterize the evolution of the infiltrating and resident immune cell populations in acneic lesions, beginning in the early stages of their development. Using a discovery cohort of 15 patients, we demonstrated that the composition of immune cell infiltrate is highly dynamic in nature, with the relative abundance of different cell types changing significantly as a function of clinical lesion stage. Within the stages examined, we identified a large population of CD69+ CD4+ T cells, several populations of activated antigen presenting cells, and activated mast cells producing IL-17. IL-17+ mast cells were preferentially located in CD4+ T cell rich areas and we showed that activated CD4+ T cells license mast cells to produce IL-17. Our study reveals that mast cells are the main IL-17 producers in the early stage of acne, underlying the importance of targeting the IL-17+ mast cell/T helper cell axis in therapeutic approaches.","  To investigate the role of tachysterol in the photophysical/chemical\nregulation of vitamin D photosynthesis, we studied its electronic absorption\nproperties and excited state dynamics using time-dependent density functional\ntheory (TDDFT), coupled cluster theory (CC2), and non-adiabatic molecular\ndynamics. In excellent agreement with experiments, the simulated electronic\nspectrum shows a broad absorption band covering the spectra of the other\nvitamin D photoisomers. The broad band stems from the spectral overlap of four\ndifferent ground state rotamers. After photoexcitation, the first excited\nsinglet state (S1) decays within 882 fs. The S1 dynamics is characterized by a\nstrong twisting of the central double bond. 96% of all trajectories relax\nwithout chemical transformation to the ground state. In 2.3 % of the\ntrajectories we observed [1,5]-sigmatropic hydrogen shift forming the partly\ndeconjugated toxisterol D1. 1.4 % previtamin D formation is observed via\nhula-twist double bond isomerization. We find a strong dependence between\nphotoreactivity and dihedral angle conformation: hydrogen shift only occurs in\ncEc and cEt rotamers and double bond isomerization occurs mainly in cEc\nrotamers. Our study confirms the hypothesis that cEc rotamers are more prone to\nprevitamin D formation than other isomers. We also observe the formation of a\ncyclobutene-toxisterol in the hot ground state (0.7 %). Due to its strong\nabsorption and unreactive behavior, tachysterol acts mainly as a sun shield\nsuppressing previtamin D formation. Tachysterol shows stronger toxisterol\nformation than previtamin D. Absorption of low energy UV light by the cEc\nrotamer can lead to previtamin D formation. Our study reinforces a recent\nhypothesis that tachysterol can act as a previtamin D source when only low\nenergy ultraviolet light is available, as it is the case in winter or in the\nmorning and evening hours of the day.\n","Transient Luciferase reporter assays are widely used in the study of gene regulation and intracellular cell signaling. In order to control for sample-to-sample variation in luminescence arising from variability in transfection efficiency and other sources, an internal control reporter is co-transfected with the experimental reporter. The luminescence of the experimental reporter is normalized against the control by taking the ratio of the two. Here we show that this method of normalization, \u201cratiometric\u201d, performs poorly when the transfection efficiency is low and leads to biased estimates of relative activity. We propose an alternative methodology based on linear regression that is much better suited for the normalization of reporter data, especially when transfection efficiency is low. We compare the ratiometric method against three regression methods on both simulated and empirical data. Our results suggest that robust errors-in-variables (REIV) regression performs the best in normalizing Luciferase reporter data. We have made the R code for Luciferase data normalization using REIV available on GitHub.","Context Endometrial health is impacted by molecular processes that underlie estrogen responses.","The extraction of accurate physiological parameters from clinical samples provides a unique perspective to understand disease etiology and evolution, including under therapy. We introduce a new proteomics framework to map patient proteome dynamics in vivo, either proteome wide or in large targeted panels. We applied it to ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and could determine the turnover parameters of almost 200 proteins, whereas a handful were known previously. We covered a large number of neuron biology- and immune system-related proteins including many biomarkers and drug targets. This first large data set unraveled a significant relationship between turnover and protein origin that relates to our ability to investigate the central nervous system physiology precisely in future studies. Our data constitute a reference in CSF biology as well as a repertoire of peptides for the community to design new proteome dynamics analyses. The disclosed methods apply to other fluids or tissues provided sequential sample collection can be performed.","Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is a hormone secreted from fully differentiated osteoblasts and osteocytes that inhibits phosphate reabsorption by kidney proximal tubules. The full-length (i.e., intact) protein mediates FGF23 endocrine functions, while endoproteolytic cleavage at a consensus cleavage sequence for the proprotein convertases (PCs) inactivates FGF23. Two PCs, furin and PC5, were shown to cleave FGF23 in vitro at RHTR179\u2193, but whether they are fulfilling this function in vivo is currently unknown. To address this question we used here mice lacking either or both furin and PC5 in cell-specific manners and mice lacking the paired basic amino acid-cleaving enzyme 4 (PACE4) in all cells. Our analysis shows that furin inactivation in osteoblasts and osteocytes results in a 25% increase in circulating intact FGF23, without any significant impact on serum phosphate levels, whether mice are maintained on a normal or a low phosphate diet. Under conditions of iron deficiency, FGF23 is normally processed in control mice, but its processing is impaired in mice lacking furin in osteoblasts and osteocytes. In contrast, FGF23 is normally cleaved following erythropoietin or IL-1\u03b2 injections in mice lacking furin or both furin and PC5, and in PACE4-deficient mice. Altogether, these studies suggest that furin is only partially responsible for FGF23 cleavage under certain conditions in vivo. The processing of FGF23 may therefore involve the redundant action of multiple PCs or of other peptidases in osteoblasts, osteocytes and hematopoietic cells.","The mouse hairless gene (Hr) encodes a protein of 127 kDa, acting as corepressor of nuclear hormone receptors. The Hairless protein (HR) is involved in the control of the cellular transition to the first hair cycle in adult Mammals. In its absence hair follicles disintegrate leading to a complete and irreversible hair loss with formation of cutaneous cysts. The hairless phenotype is therefore linked to defective proliferation and migration of the hair follicle stem cells apparently unable to respond to various signalling molecules. The Hr gene is expressed at high levels in skin and brain, and hairless transcripts were detected in gonads, thymus and colon. Although the patterns of Hr expression appear to be spatially and temporally regulated, very little is known about the molecular basis of the transcriptional control underlying Hr gene function. In this work we determine the precise transcriptional initiation start site of the mouse Hr gene and identify a new 1,1 kb cis-control element (RE1) that encompasses the promoter region and is able to drive luciferase reporter expression in skin and brain derived cell lines. We performed a deletion analysis and explored functionally regulatory motifs within this fragment to show that the role of this upstream regulatory region is linked to the presence of TRE and VDRE binding sites. We find that a TRE situated at \u2013300 bp from the cap site is essential for gene expression in both skin NIH 3T3 and GHFT1 cells, while a VDRE positioned 94 bp upstream of the TRE modulates reporter expression specifically in skin derived cell lines. In addition, we define a novel cis-regulatory motif UE60, situated at the 5\u2019-end of RE1 and likely to interact with both TRE and VDRE. Our data complete previous results on the possible existence of an autoregulatory pathway, implicated in Hr gene regulation. Taken together these findings reveal a complex molecular network that potentially links several signalling pathways in hair follicle formation. We discuss the organisation of the regulatory modules in the mouse Hr gene upstream DNA sequences in the light of the high homology of this region in mouse, rat and human.","Vitamin D is a well-known micronutrient that modulates immune responses by epigenetic and transcriptional regulation of target genes, such as inflammatory cytokines. Our group recently demonstrated that the most active form of vitamin D, calcitriol, reduces expression of a transcription factor known as the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and inhibits differentiation of a pro-inflammatory T cell subset, Th9. Lithocholic acid (LCA), a secondary bile acid produced by commensal bacteria, is known to bind to and activate the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in a manner comparable to calcitriol. In this study, Na\u00efve CD4 T cells were isolated from healthy human umbilical mononuclear cells and were stimulated in the presence or absence of LCA. We determined the effect of LCA on human cord blood T cell activation by measuring IFN-\u03b3 production and protein expression of IFN-\u03b3 receptor-mediated signaling molecules. We found that LCA reduces production of IFN-\u03b3 and decreases phosphorylation of STAT1 as well as expression of AhR, STAT1, and IRF1 by activated human cord blood CD4 T cells. LCA inhibits expression of IFN-\u03b3 and reduces its receptor signaling molecules.","Human pigmentation is a highly diverse and complex trait among populations, and has drawn particular attention from both academic and non-academic investigators for thousands of years. Previous studies detected selection signals in several human pigmentation genes, but few studies have integrated contribution from multiple genes to the evolution of human pigmentation. Moreover, none has quantified selective pressures on human pigmentation over epochs and between populations. Here, we dissect dynamics and differences of selective pressures during different periods and between distinct populations with new approaches. We propose a new model with multiple populations to estimate historical selective pressures by summarizing selective pressures on multiple genes. We use genotype data of 19 genes associated with human pigmentation from 17 datasets, and obtain data for 2346 individuals of six representative population groups from worldwide. Our results quantify selective pressures on light pigmentation not only in modern Europeans (0.0249/generation) but also in proto-Eurasians (0.00665/generation). Our results also support several derived alleles associated with human dark pigmentation may under directional selection by quantifying differences of selective pressures between populations. Our study provides a first attempt to quantitatively investigate the dynamics of selective pressures during different time periods in the evolution of human pigmentation, and may facilitate studies of the evolution of other complex traits.","The impact of host genetics on gut microbial dynamics is debated. No study to date has investigated the possible role of host genetics in shaping the gut microbiota in HIV-1 infected subjects. With the aim of generating preliminary data to inform future host genetic studies, we performed an exploratory host exome analysis of 147 subjects either infected or at risk of becoming infected with HIV-1 from the MetaHIV cohort in Barcelona. Using a DNA microarray chip, we sought to identify host genetic variants associated to three specific microbial features with a potentially inheritable component, and which were previously found to be associated with gut dysbiosis in HIV infection, i.e.: gut enterotype, presence of methanogenic archaea and microbial gene richness. After correction for multiple comparisons, we did not observe any statistically significant association between the host\u2019s genetic landscape and the explored gut microbiome traits. These findings will help design future, adequately-powered studies to assess the influence of host genetics in the microbiome of HIV-1-infected subjects.","There is a wealth of data indicating human bone marrow derived stromal cells (HBMSCs) contain the skeletal stem cell (SSC) with the potential to differentiate along the stromal osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic lineages. However, despite these advances, current methods to isolate skeletal stem cells (SSCs) from human tissues have proved challenging as no single specific marker has been identified limiting understanding of SSC fate, immunophenotype and the widespread clinical application of these cells. While a number of cell surface markers can enrich for SSCs, none of the proposed markers, alone, provide a platform to isolate single cells with the ability to form bone, cartilage, and adipose tissue in humans. The current study details the application of oligonucleotide-coated nanoparticles, spherical nucleic acids (SNAs), to rapidly isolate human cells using mRNAs signatures detected in SSCs in real time, to identify stem and progenitor skeletal populations using single cell RNA sequencing. Based on scRNA-seq of samples from 11 patients, this method was able to identify novel targets for SSC enrichment, which were assessed in a total of 80 patients. This methodology was able to isolate potential SSCs found at a frequency of &lt;1 in 1,000,000 in human bone marrow, with a capacity for tri-lineage differentiation in vitro. The current approach provides new targets and a platform to advance SSC isolation, enrichment with significant therapeutic impact therein.","Background Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a widespread disease that represents an example of chronic inflammation-associated tumor. In fact, the immune system, besides protecting the host from developing tumors, can support the CRC progression. In this scenario, the gut microbiota (GM) is essential to modulate immune responses and a dysbiotic condition can favor chronic/abnormal immune activation that support the tumor growth. GM can elicit the production of cytokines, influencing the immunostimulatory or immunosuppressive reactions, such as the tendency to mount Th1, Th17, Tregs or Th9 responses that play different roles towards colon cancer. Paradigmatic is the role of IL-9 that can both promote tumor progression in hematological malignancies and inhibit tumorigenesis in solid cancers. Therefore, to investigate the microbiota-immunity axis in CRC patients is crucial to well understand the cancer development with positive relapses in prevention and treatment.","The mineral content of complete pet food is regulated to ensure health of the companion animal population. A comprehensive analysis of adherence to these regulatory guidelines has not been conducted. We measured mineral composition of a range of complete wet (n=97) and dry (n=80) canine and feline pet food sold in the UK to assess compliance with EU guidelines. While a majority of foods complied with \u22658 of 11 guidelines (99% and 83% for dry and wet food, respectively), many failed to provide nutritional minimum (e.g. Cu, 20 % of wet food) or exceeded nutritional maximum (e.g. Se, 76% of wet food). Only 6% (6/97) of wet and 39% (34/80) of dry food were fully compliant. Some foods (20-30% of all analysed) had mineral imbalances such as not having the recommended balance of Ca:P (between 1:1 to 2:1). Foods with high fish content had high levels of undesirable metal elements such as arsenic. The study highlights broad non-compliance of a range of popular pet foods sold in the UK with EU guidelines (95% and 61% of wet and dry foods, respectively). If fed exclusively and over an extended period, a number of these pet foods could impact the general health of companion animals.","While tuberculosis represents a significant disease burden worldwide, low-incidence countries strive to reach the WHO target of elimination by 2025. Screening for TB in immigrants is an important component of the strategy to reduce the TB burden in low-incidence settings. An important option is the screening and preventive treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). Whether this policy is worthwhile depends on the extent of transmission within the country, and introduction of new cases through import. Mathematical transmission models of tuberculosis have been used to identify key parameters in the epidemiology of TB and estimate transmission rates. An important application has also been to investigate the consequences of policy scenarios.","Delivery mode is the variable with the greatest influence on the infant gut microbiome composition in the first few months of life. Children born by Cesarean section (C-section) lack species from the Bacteroides genus in their gut microbial community, and this difference can be detectable until 6-18 months of age. One hypothesis is that these differences stem from lack of exposure to the maternal vaginal microbiome, as children born by C-section do not pass through the birth canal; however, Bacteroides species are not common members of the vaginal microbiome, thus this explanation seems inadequate. Here, we set out to re-evaluate this hypothesis by collecting rectal and vaginal samples before delivery from 73 mothers with paired stool from their infants in the first two weeks of life. We compared microbial profiles of infants born by planned, pre-labor C-section to those born by emergent, post-labor surgery (where the child was in the birth canal, but eventually delivered through an abdominal incision), and found no significant differences in the microbiome between these two groups. Both groups showed the characteristic signature lack of Bacteroides species, despite their difference in exposure to the birth canal. Surprisingly, this signature was only evident in samples from week two of life, but not in the first week. Children born by C-section often had high abundance of Bacteroides in their first few days of life, but these were not stable colonizers of the infant gut, as they were not detectable by week two. Finally, we used metagenomic sequencing to compare microbial strains in maternal vaginal and rectal samples and samples from their infants; we found evidence for mother-to-child transmission of rectal rather than vaginal strains. These results challenge birth canal exposure as the dominant factor in infant gut microbiome establishment and implicate colonization efficiency rather than exposure as a dictating factor of the newborn gut microbiome composition.","Cofilin is an essential actin filament severing protein necessary for fast actin turnover dynamics. Segments of actin bound to cofilin adapt an alternative twist. This configuration is stable, but boundaries between cofilin occupied and unoccupied polymer are weak and fragment. Coronin and Aip1 are two factors that promote cofilin mediated actin filament disassembly, but whether they simply accelerate the basic cofilin severing mechanism or alter the mode of filament disassembly is still being investigated. Using electron microscopy and spectroscopy, we show that coronin accelerates phosphate release from F-actin to stimulate highly cooperative cofilin binding on to the polymer creating long stretches with a hypertwisted morphology. We find that Aip1 attacks these hypertwisted regions along their length, not just the boundaries, causing sections to disintegrate into monomers. Therefore, coronin promotes cofilin binding to F-actin to generate longer segments of polymer that are themselves the substrates for Aip1 mediated disintegration, as opposed to simply creating more heterotypic junctions that would sever. The morphological characteristics of the disassembling filaments along with spectroscopic data showing the rapid liberation of actin monomers suggest that the combination of cofilin, coronin, and Aip1 might be triggering a more catastrophic mode of filament disassembly than severing.","Glucocorticoids (GCs) exert potent anti-inflammatory effects in immune cells through the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Dendritic cells (DCs), central actors for coordinating immune responses, acquire tolerogenic properties in response to GCs. Tolerogenic DCs (tolDCs) have emerged as a potential treatment for various inflammatory diseases. To date, the underlying cell type-specific regulatory mechanisms orchestrating GC-mediated acquisition of immunosuppressive properties remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the transcriptomic and epigenomic remodeling associated with differentiation to DCs in the presence of GCs. Our analysis demonstrates a major role of MAFB in this process, in synergy with GR. GR and MAFB both interact with methylcytosine dioxygenase TET2 and bind to genomic loci that undergo specific demethylation in tolDCs. We also show that the role of MAFB is more extensive, binding to thousands of genomic loci in tolDCs. Finally, MAFB knockdown erases the tolerogenic properties of tolDCs and reverts the specific DNA demethylation and gene upregulation. The preeminent role of MAFB is also demonstrated in vivo for myeloid cells from synovium in rheumatoid arthritis following GC treatment. Our results imply that, once directly activated by GR, MAFB takes over the main roles to orchestrate the epigenomic and transcriptomic remodeling that define the tolerogenic phenotype.","Erythropoiesis is the process by which new red blood cells (RBCs) are formed and defects in this process can lead to anemia or thalassemia. The GATA1 transcription factor is an established mediator of RBC development. However, the upstream mechanisms that regulate the expression of GATA1 are not completely characterized. Cholesterol is one potential upstream mediator of GATA1 expression because previously published studies suggest that defects in cholesterol synthesis disrupt RBC differentiation. Here we characterize RBC development in a zebrafish harboring a single missense mutation in the hmgcs1 gene (Vu57 allele). hmgcs1 encodes the first enzyme in the cholesterol synthesis pathway and mutation of hmgcs1 inhibits cholesterol synthesis. We analyzed the number of RBCs in hmgcs1 mutants and their wildtype siblings. Mutation of hmgcs1 resulted in a decrease in the number of mature RBCs, which coincides with reduced gata1a expression. We combined these experiments with pharmacological inhibition and confirmed that cholesterol and isoprenoid synthesis are essential for RBC differentiation, but that gata1a expression is isoprenoid dependent. Collectively, our results reveal two novel upstream regulators of RBC development and suggest that appropriate cholesterol homeostasis is critical for primitive erythropoiesis.","Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (N-BPs), such as alendronate, are the most widely prescribed medications for diseases involving bone, with nearly 200 million prescriptions written annually. Recently, widespread use of N-BPs has been challenged due to the risk of rare but traumatic side effects such as atypical femoral fracture (AFFs) and osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). N-BPs bind to and inhibit farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FDPS), resulting in defects in protein prenylation. Yet it remains poorly understood what other cellular factors might allow N-BPs to exert their pharmacological effects. Here, we performed genome-wide studies in cells and patients to identify the poorly characterized gene, ATRAID. Loss of ATRAID function results in selective resistance to N-BP-mediated loss of cell viability and the prevention of alendronate-mediated inhibition of prenylation. ATRAID is required for alendronate inhibition of osteoclast function, and ATRAID-deficient mice have impaired therapeutic responses to alendronate in both postmenopausal and senile (old age) osteoporosis models. Lastly, we performed exome sequencing on patients taking N-BPs that suffered ONJ or an AFF. ATRAID is one of three genes that contain rare non-synonymous coding variants in patients with ONJ or AFF that is also differentially expressed in poor outcome groups of patients treated with N-BPs. We functionally validated this patient variation in ATRAID as conferring cellular hypersensitivity to N-BPs. Our work adds key insight into the mechanistic action of N-BPs and the processes that might underlie differential responsiveness to N-BPs in people.","A novel strain named Meyerozyma guilliermondii GXDK6 was provided in this work, which was confirmed to survive independently under high salt stress (12% NaCl) or co-stress condition of strong acid (pH 3.0) and high salts (10% NaCl) without sterilization. Its survival mechanism under high salt stress was revealed by integrated omics for the first time. Whole-genome analysis showed that 14 genes (e.g., GPD1 and FPS1) of GXDK6 relevant to salt tolerance were annotated and known to belong to various salt-resistant mechanisms (e.g., regulation of cell signal transduction and glycerol metabolism controls). Transcriptome sequencing results indicated that 1220 genes (accounting for 10.15%) of GXDK6 were differentially transcribed (p &lt; 0.05) when GXDK6 growth was under 10% stress for 16 h, including important novel salt-tolerant-related genes (e.g., RTM1 and YHB1). Proteomics analysis demonstrated that 1005 proteins (accounting for 27.26%) of GXDK6 were differentially expressed (p &lt; 0.05) when GXDK6 was stressed by 10% NaCl. Some of the differentially expressed proteins were defined as the novel salt-tolerant related proteins (e.g., sugar transporter STL1 and NADPH-dependent methylglyoxal reductase). Metabolomic analysis results showed that 63 types of metabolites (e.g., D-mannose, glycerol and inositol phosphate) of GXDK6 were up- or downregulated when stressed by 10% NaCl. Among them, D-mannose is one of the important metabolites that could enhance the salt-tolerance survival of GXDK6.","Moringa oleifera plant contains a numerous antioxidants, antibiotics and nutrients (vitamins and minerals) which makes it prospective for diverse biomedical applications. This report investigated the anti-cancerous and anti-microbial potential of the Moringa oleifera seeds (MOSs) due to the bioactive components a detail elemental analysis. MOSs in the form of pellets were used in elemental analysis. Alcoholic extraction of were utilized in anti-cancerous and anti-microbial activity.To clarify the anti-cancerous and anti-microbial potential of the  (MOSs)  because of the bioactive components. An elemental analysis was conducted using  Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS)  . The  GC-MS  used for the validation of the LIBS outcome. Additionally, the anti-cancerous and anti-microbial activity of the MOSs was evaluated. Herein, the human colorectal carcinoma cells (HCT-116) were treated with the seeds aqueous extracts for 48 h and the cell viability plus the DNA nuclear morphology were measured via the MTT assay and DAPI staining. The cell viability of the normal human embryonic stem cells (HEK-293) was also examined after the treatment. Percentage of cell viability and inhibitory concentration (IC  50  ) of both normal and treated cells were determined.The recorded LIBS signal of the  MOSs  revealed the existence of elements like Ca, K, Mg, P, S, Fe, Mn, Zn, Na and Se (vital for human health). The results of the MTT assay revealed a profound inhibitory action of the MOSs extracts against the HCT-116 cells growth. On top, such extracts did not affect the HEK-293 cells growth, indicating the specificity of the proposed extracts towards cancer cells escalation hindrance. The anti-microbial activity of the ethanolic MOSs extracts was tested on the S. aureus and E. coli bacteria using the Agar well diffusion assay. The observed anti-cancerous and the anti-microbial activities of the MOSs extracts can be attributed to the charisma of various bioactive compounds including the oleic acid, palmitic acid, hexadecenoic acid ethyl ester and D-allose.\nConclusion:  Current observations may contribute towards the development of the MOSs-based biomedicine (organic without any side effects, cheap, plentiful, pure and sustainable) effective for the cancer and bacterial infection cure.","We quantified S1-specific IgG, neutralizing antibody titers, specific IFN\u03b3 secreting T cells and functionality of specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in 130 young adults (median age 44.0 years) and 106 older residents living in a long-term care facility (86.5 years) after 2 doses of BNT162b2. Three months after the first injection, humoral and cellular memory responses were dramatically impaired in the 54 COVID-19-naive older compared to the 121 COVID-19-naive younger adults. Notably, older participants\u2019 neutralizing antibodies, detected in 76.5% (versus 100% in young adults, P &lt; 0.0001), were ten times lower than the younger\u2019s antibody titers (P &lt; 0.0001). Antibody and T cell responses were greater among the 52 COVID-19-recovered than among the 54 COVID-19-naive older adults (P &lt; 0.0001). Our study shows that 2 doses of BNT162b2 does not guarantee long-term protection against SARS-CoV-2 in the older. An additional dose should be considered to boost their specific memory response.","TGF-\u03b2 family ligands are key regulators of dendritic cell (DC) differentiation and activation. Epidermal Langerhans cells (LCs) require TGF- \u03b2 family signaling for their differentiation and canonical TGF-\u03b21 signaling secures a non-activated LC state. LCs reportedly control skin inflammation and are replenished from peripheral blood monocytes, which also give rise to pro-inflammatory monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs). Among all the miRNAs differentially expressed in LC vs moDCs, we observed miR-424 to be strongly induced during moDC differentiation from monocytes. We discovered that miR-424 is required for moDC differentiation from human and murine precursor cells in vitro and for inflammation-associated moDC in vivo. Mechanistically we found that low levels of miR-424 facilitate TGF-\u03b21-dependent LC differentiation at the expense of moDC differentiation. Loss of miR-424 in monocyte/DC precursors resulted in the induction of TGF-\u03b2 pathway. Therefore, miR-424 plays a decisive role in anti-inflammatory LC vs pro-inflammatory moDC differentiation from monocytes, and its repression allows TGF-\u03b2 ligands to promote LC differentiation.","Omeg@Silica microparticles consisting of whole fish oil rich in omega-3 lipids, vitamin D3 and zeaxanthin extracted with biobased limonene from anchovy fillet leftovers (AnchoisOil) encapsulated within mesoporous silica particles are highly effective in modulating oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage or in promoting antitumor effects in lung cancer cells. A panel of three different human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines (A549, Colo 699 and SKMES) was used. Cancer cells were treated with AnchoisOil dispersed in ethanol (10 and 15 \u03bcg/ml) or encapsulated in silica, and cell cycle, reactive oxigen species (ROS) and mitochondrial stress (MitoSOX) assessed by flow cytometry. The effects on long-term proliferation (clonogenic assay) were also evaluated. The sub-micron Omeg@Silica microparticles were more effective than fish oil alone in increasing ROS and mitocondrial damage, in altering cell cycle as well as in reducing colony formation ability in the tested lung cancer cell lines. These results suggest that Omeg@Silica mesoporous silica functionalized with whole fish oil has antitumor effects in NSCLC cell lines and support its investigation in lung cancer therapy.","Vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) or GC-globulin carries vitamin D metabolites from the circulation to target tissues. DBP expression is highly-localized to the liver and pancreatic \u03b1-cells. While DBP serum levels, gene polymorphisms and autoantigens have all been associated with diabetes risk, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we show that DBP regulates \u03b1-cell morphology, \u03b1-cell function and glucagon secretion. Deletion of DBP led to smaller and hyperplastic \u03b1-cells, altered Na+ channel conductance, impaired \u03b1-cell activation by low glucose, and reduced rates of glucagon secretion. Mechanistically, this involved reversible changes in islet microfilament abundance and density, as well as changes in glucagon granule distribution. Defects were also seen in \u03b2-cell and \u03b4-cell function. Immunostaining of human pancreata revealed generalized loss of DBP expression as a feature of late-onset and longstanding, but not early-onset type 1 diabetes. Thus, DBP is a critical regulator of \u03b1-cell phenotype, with implications for diabetes pathogenesis.","Aging and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are associated with impaired skeletal muscle function and degeneration of the skeletal muscle microenvironment. However, the origin and mechanisms underlying the degeneration are not well described in human skeletal muscle. Here we show that skeletal muscles of T2DM patients exhibit pathological degenerative remodeling of the extracellular matrix that was associated with a selective increase of a subpopulation of fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) marked by expression of THY1 (CD90) - the FAPCD90+. We identified Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling as key regulator of human FAP biology, as it promotes proliferation and collagen production at the expense of adipogenesis, an effect accompanied with a metabolic shift towards glycolytic lactate fermentation. FAPsCD90+ showed a PDGF-mimetic phenotype, with high proliferative activity and clonogenicity, increased production of extracellular matrix production and enhanced glycolysis. Importantly, the pathogenic phenotype of T2DM FAPCD90+ was reduced by treatment with the anti-diabetic drug Metformin. These data identify PDGF-driven conversion of a sub-population of FAPs as a key event in the pathogenic accumulation of extracellular matrix in T2DM muscles.","The active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D), plays an important immunomodulatory role, regulating transcription of genes in the innate and adaptive immune system. The present study examines patterns of transcriptome-wide response to 1,25D and the bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in primary human monocytes, to elucidate pathways underlying the effects of 1,25D on the immune system. Monocytes obtained from healthy individuals of African-African and European-American ancestry were treated with 1,25D alone or in the presence of LPS, which induced significant up-regulation of genes in the antimicrobial and autophagy pathways, while pro-inflammatory response genes were significantly down-regulated. A joint Bayesian analysis enabled clustering of genes into patterns of shared transcriptional response across treatments. The biological pathways enriched within these expression patterns highlighted several mechanisms through which 1,25D could exert its immunomodulatory role. Pathways such as mTOR signaling, EIF2 signaling, IL-8 signaling and Tec Kinase signaling were enriched among genes with opposite transcriptional responses to 1,25D and LPS, respectively, highlighting the important roles of these pathways in mediating the immunomodulatory activity of 1,25D. Furthermore, a subset of genes with evidence of inter-ethnic differences in transcriptional response was also identified, suggesting that in addition to the well-established inter-ethnic variation in circulating levels of vitamin D, the intensity of transcriptional response to 1,25D and LPS also varies between ethnic groups. We propose that dysregulation of the pathways identified in this study could contribute to immune-mediated disease risk.","Mutations in TRPC6 are a cause of autosomal dominant focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in humans. Many of these mutations are known to have a gain-of-function effect on the non-specific cation channel function of TRPC6. In vitro studies have suggested these mutations affect several signaling pathways, but in vivo studies have largely compared wild-type and Trpc6-deficient rodents. We developed mice carrying a gain-of-function Trpc6 mutation encoding an E896K amino acid change, corresponding to a known FSGS mutation in TRPC6. Homozygous mutant Trpc6 animals have no appreciable renal pathology, and do not develop albuminuria until very advanced age. The Trpc6E896K mutation does not impart susceptibility to PAN nephrosis. The animals show a slight delay in recovery from the albumin overload model. In response to chronic angiotensin II infusion, Trpc6E896K/E896K mice have slightly greater albuminuria initially compared to wild-type animals, an effect that is lost at later time points, and a statistically non-significant trend toward more glomerular injury. This phenotype is nearly opposite to that of Trpc6-deficient animals previously described. The Trpc6 mutation does not appreciably impact renal interstitial fibrosis in response to either angiotensin II infusion, or folate-induced kidney injury. TRPC6 protein and TRPC6-agonist induced calcium influx could not be detected in glomeruli. In sum, these findings suggest that a gain-of-function Trpc6 mutation confers only a mild susceptibility to glomerular injury in the mouse.","This study aimed to evaluate the consequences of increased bone mobilization in early lactation on the dynamics of the milk Ca content during lactation and bone reconstitution. Fifteen multiparous Holstein cows were distributed among 3 treatments 5 weeks before their expected calving date. Those treatments consisted of the provision of dedicated diets through the first 10 weeks of lactation. During that period, the control treatment (NCa) consisted of a diet providing 100\\% of the Ca requirements, with a dietary cation-anion difference (DCAD) of 200 mEq/kg DM. The treatments LCa (Low Ca) and LCaLD (Low Ca, Low DCAD) consisted of diets providing 70% of the Ca requirements, with a DCAD of 200 and 0 mEq/kg DM for LCa and LCaLD, respectively. After 10 weeks, all cows received the same total mixed ration which was formulated to meet 100\\% of the Ca requirements. LCa and LCaLD tended to decrease the body retention of Ca at 3 weeks of lactation compared with NCa, but did not affect either the dynamics of the blood biomarkers of bone formation and resorption during the lactation or the body retention of Ca at 17 weeks of lactation. Cows almost entirely compensated for the decrease in Ca supply by increasing their apparent digestive absorption of Ca at 3 weeks of lactation, whereas the apparent digestive absorption was unaffected by the treatments at 17 weeks of lactation. Milk production tended to be lower throughout lactation with the LCa and LCaLD compared with the NCa, with a mean difference of 2 kg/d. This study indicated that measuring the dynamics of the milk Ca content during lactation cannot be considered effective for indirectly estimating the dynamics of bone mobilization of cows. The results also showed that limited Ca intake at the beginning of lactation can have deleterious effect on milk production.","COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 (1), was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020 (2). While awaiting a vaccine, several antivirals are being used to manage the disease with limited success (3, 4). To expand this arsenal, we screened 4 compound libraries: a United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug library, an angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) targeted compound library, a flavonoid compound library as well as a natural product library. Of the 121 compounds identified with activity against SARS-CoV-2, 7 were shortlisted for validation. We show for the first time that the active form of Vitamin D, calcitriol, exhibits significant potent activity against SARS-CoV-2. This finding paves the way for consideration of host-directed therapies for ring prophylaxis of contacts of SARS-CoV-2 patients.","Drug repurposing is the only method capable of delivering treatments on the shortened time-scale required for patients afflicted with lung disease arising from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mucin-1 (MUC1), a membrane-bound molecule expressed on the apical surfaces of most mucosal epithelial cells, is a biochemical marker whose elevated levels predict the development of acute lung injury (ALI) and respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and correlate with poor clinical outcomes. In response to the pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2, we took advantage of a high content screen of 3,713 compounds at different stages of clinical development to identify FDA-approved compounds that reduce MUC1 protein abundance. Our screen identified Fostamatinib (R788), an inhibitor of spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) approved for the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia, as a repurposing candidate for the treatment of ALI. In vivo, Fostamatinib reduced MUC1 abundance in lung epithelial cells in a mouse model of ALI. In vitro, SYK inhibition by Fostamatinib promoted MUC1 removal from the cell surface. Our work reveals Fostamatinib as a repurposing drug candidate for ALI and provides the rationale for rapidly standing up clinical trials to test Fostamatinib efficacy in patients with COVID-19 lung injury.","Genome editing and neuronal differentiation protocols have proliferated in the last decade. Mutations in genes that control pluripotency could lead to a potential obstacle with regards to the survival and differentiation potential of the genome-edited cell lines. Here we describe a protocol for the generation, and differentiation, of cell lines containing CRISPR/Cas9 induced mutations in the histone methyl transferase ASH1L. This chromatin modifier was previously implicated in hematopoietic stem cell pluripotency and is a major genetic risk factor for autism spectrum disorders (ASD). We find that haploinsufficiency of ASH1L leads to decreased NANOG gene expression leading to reduce cell survival and increased spontaneous differentiation. We report a method that provides improved single-cell survival with higher colony formation efficiency in ASH1L mutant stem cells. Additionally, we describe a modified dual-SMAD inhibition neuronal induction methodology that permits the successful generation of human neurons with mutations in ASH1L, in a smaller scale than previously reported methods. With our modified CRISPR-genome editing and neuronal differentiation protocols, it is possible to generate genome-edited stem cells containing mutations in genes that impact pluripotency and could affect subsequent cell lineage specific differentiation. Our detailed technical report presents cost-effective strategies that will benefit researchers focusing on both translational and basic science using stem cell experimental systems.","The study of gene-gene interactions in RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) data has traditionally been hard owing the large number of genes detectable by Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). However, differential gene-gene pairs can inform our understanding of biological processes and yield improved prediction models. Here, we utilised four well curated pathway repositories obtaining 10,537 experimentally evaluated gene-gene interactions. We then extracted specific gene-gene interaction networks in synovial RNA-Seq to characterise histologically-defined pathotypes in early rheumatoid arthritis patients. Specific gene-gene networks were also leveraged to predict response to methotrexate-based disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy in the Pathobiology of Early Arthritis Cohort (PEAC). We statistically evaluated the differential interactions identified within each network using robust linear regression models, and the ability to predict response was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.","Bovine papillomavirus (BPV) is the etiological agent of bovine papillomatosis, infectious disease characterized by the presence of benign tumors that can progress to malignancy. The phylogenetic classification of the PVs is performed based on the sequence homology of the Open Reading Frame L1, the most conserved among different viral serotypes. Given the immunogenicity of saponins, it,s has been used as a candidate as adjuvant use. For this reason, the safety of using saponin as an adjuvant has to be better determined to human or veterinary vaccine use. So, this study aimed to evaluate the mutagenic and genotoxic effect of saponins in comparison with the adjuvant widely used aluminum hydroxide using an isolated and purified L1 protein from BPV as model. In this study, genomic lesions, which after processed without repair can result in mutations, were detected by comet assay. Possible damages to genetic material caused by structural chromosomal changes (clastogenesis), as well as chromosomal losses (aneugenesis) were evaluated by the micronucleus test. Both tests were done on polychromatic erythrocytes and Vero cells. The evaluation of apoptosis and necrosis of treated Vero cells was made by Annexin V / PI staining and flow cytometry. The two vaccine products (L1 +Saponin and L1 + Aluminum Hydroxide) showed damages compatible with the positive control in the comet assay and both slightly elevated the micronucleus levels, in the Cell Viability Assay the results with Aluminum Hydroxide were satisfactory, characterizing Aluminum Hydroxide as a safer adjuvant according to the proposed tests, better than the saponins. Some fractions of the saponin extract separated by High Performance Liquid Chromatography were evaluated against genotoxic activity by comet assay, and their identities were confirmed by similarity to the reference standard by mass spectrometry.","NAD+ is modulated by conditions of metabolic stress and has been reported to decline with aging, but human data are sparse. Nicotinamide riboside (NR) supplementation ameliorates metabolic dysfunction in rodents. We aimed to establish whether oral NR supplementation in aged participants can increase the skeletal muscle NAD+ metabolome, and questioned if tissue NAD+ levels are depressed with aging. We supplemented 12 aged men with NR 1g per day for 21-days in a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, crossover trial. Targeted metabolomics showed that NR elevated the muscle NAD+ metabolome, evident by increased nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide and nicotinamide clearance products. Muscle RNA sequencing revealed NR-mediated downregulation of energy metabolism and mitochondria pathways. NR also depressed levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines. In an additional study, 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy-based NAD+ measurement in muscle and brain showed no difference between young and aged individuals. Our data establish that oral NR is available to aged human muscle and identify anti-inflammatory effects of NR, while suggesting that NAD+ decline is not associated with chronological aging per se in human muscle or brain.","Genome-wide association studies have identified hundreds of signals for type 2 diabetes (T2D), most of which confer risk through effects on gene expression. We previously identified the transcription factor ZMIZ1 as a probable effector transcript in human islets, but how altered ZMIZ1  expression impacts T2D risk is unknown. We now show that islets from carriers of the T2D-risk alleles have reduced islet insulin content and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. To elucidate the mechanism for islet-cell dysfunction, we generated \u03b2-cell-specific Zmiz1 knockout (Zmiz1\u03b2KO) mice. Male and female Zmiz1\u03b2KO mice were glucose intolerant with impaired insulin secretion, compared with control littermates. Transcriptomic profiling of Zmiz1\u03b2KO islets identified over 500 differentially expressed genes including those involved in \u03b2-cell function and maturity which we confirmed at the protein level. After high fat feeding, Zmiz1\u03b2KO mice fail to expand \u03b2-cell mass and become severely diabetic. Thus, Zmiz1 is required for normal glucose homeostasis and may contribute to T2D risk by maintaining a mature \u03b2-cell state and allowing islet mass expansion upon metabolic stress.","Many of genes mediating Known Drug-Disease Association (KDDA) are escaped from experimental detection. Identifying of these genes (hidden genes) is of great significance for understanding disease pathogenesis and guiding drug repurposing. Here, we presented a novel computational tool, called KDDANet, for systematic and accurate uncovering the hidden genes mediating KDDA from the perspective of genome-wide functional gene interaction network. KDDANet demonstrated the competitive performances in both sensitivity and specificity of identifying genes in mediating KDDA in comparison to the existing state-of-the-art methods. Case studies on Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and obesity uncovered the mechanistic relevance of KDDANet predictions. Furthermore, when applied with multiple types of cancer-omics datasets, KDDANet not only recapitulated known genes mediating KDDAs related to cancer, but also revealed novel candidates that offer new biological insights. Importantly, KDDANet can be used to discover the shared genes mediating multiple KDDAs. KDDANet can be accessed at http://www.kddanet.cn and the code can be freely downloaded at https://github.com/huayu1111/KDDANet.","Trillions of microbes such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses exist in the healthy human gut microbiome. Although gut bacterial dysbiosis has been extensively studied in multiple sclerosis (MS), the significance of the fungal microbiome (mycobiome) is an understudied and neglected part of the intestinal microbiome in MS. The aim of this study was to characterize the gut mycobiome of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), compare it to healthy controls, and examine its association with changes in the bacterial microbiome. We characterized and compared the mycobiome of 20 RRMS patients and 33 healthy controls (HC) using Internal Transcribed Spacer 2 (ITS2) and compared mycobiome interactions with the bacterial microbiome using 16S rRNA sequencing. Our results demonstrate an altered mycobiome in RRMS patients compared with HC. RRMS patients showed an increased abundance of Basidiomycota and decreased Ascomycota at the phylum level with an increased abundance of Candida and Epicoccum genera along with a decreased abundance of Saccharomyces compared to HC. We also observed an increased ITS2/16S ratio, altered fungal and bacterial associations, and altered fungal functional profiles in MS patients compared to HC.","Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common degenerative joint disease, and joint injury increases the risk of OA by 10-fold. Although the injury event itself damages joint tissues, a substantial amount of secondary damage is mediated by the cellular responses to the injury. Cellular responses include the production and activation of proteases (MMPs, ADAMTSs, Cathepsins), the production of inflammatory cytokines, and we hypothesize, changes to the joint metabolome. The trajectory of cellular responses is driven by the transcriptional activation of early response genes, which requires Cdk9-dependent RNA Polymerase II phosphorylation. Flavopiridol is a potent and selective inhibitor of Cdk9 kinase activity, which prevents the transcriptional activation of early response genes. To model post-traumatic osteoarthritis, we subjected mice to non-invasive ACL-rupture joint injury. Following injury, mice were treated with flavopiridol to inhibit Cdk9-dependent transcriptional activation, or vehicle control. Global joint metabolomics were analyzed 1 hour after injury. We found that injury induced metabolomic changes, including increases in Vitamin D3 metabolism and others. Importantly, we found that inhibition of primary response gene activation at the time of injury largely prevented the global changes in the metabolomics profiles. Cluster analysis of joint metabolomes identified groups of injury-induced and drug-responsive metabolites, which may offer novel targets for cell-mediated secondary joint damage. Metabolomic profiling provides an instantaneous snapshot of biochemical activity representing cellular responses, and these data demonstrate the potential for inhibition of early response genes to alter the trajectory of cell-mediated degenerative changes following joint injury.","Motivation A major challenge in cancer genomics is to distinguish the driver mutations that are causally linked to cancer from passenger mutations that do not contribute to cancer development. The majority of existing methods provide a single driver gene list for the entire cohort of patients. However, since mutation profiles of patients from the same cancer type show a high degree of heterogeneity, a more ideal approach is to identify patient-specific drivers.","Chromatin remodeler SWI/SNF is an important participant of gene activation acting predominantly by opening chromatin structure on promoters and enhancers. Here we describe its novel mode of action by mediating targeted action of enhancer. We studied functions of two signature subunits of PBAP subfamily, BAP170 and SAYP, in Drosophila. These subunits were stably tethered onto transgene reporter carrying hsp70 core promoter. Tethered subunits mediate transcription of reporter in a pattern prescribed by nearby enhancer in multiple loci throughout the genome, where the reporter construct was located. Both tethered SAYP and BAP170 recruit the whole PBAP complex onto reporter promoter. Studying difference between these subunits, we found that BAP170-dependent transcription is more resistant to depletion of other PBAP subunits, what may imply the principal role of BAP170 in establishing enhancer-dependent transcription.","Recent positive selection can increase the frequency of an advantageous mutant rapidly enough that a relatively long ancestral haplotype will be remained intact around it. We present a hidden Markov model (HMM) to identify such haplotype structures. With HMM identified haplotype structures, a population genetic model for the extent of ancestral haplotypes is then adopted for parameter inference of the selection intensity and the allele age. Simulations show that this method can detect selection under a wide range of conditions and has higher power than the existing frequency spectrum-based method. In addition, it provides good estimate of the selection coefficients and allele ages for strong selection. The method analyzes large data sets in a reasonable amount of running time. This method is applied to HapMap III data for a genome scan, and identifies a list of candidate regions putatively under recent positive selection. It is also applied to several genes known to be under recent positive selection, including the LCT, KITLG and TYRP1 genes in Northern Europeans, and OCA2 in East Asians, to estimate their allele ages and selection coefficients.","Antizyme inhibitor 1 (AZIN1) is a critical target in prostate cancer, which regulates the adenosine-to-inosine (A to I) RNA editing during the cancer progression. However, the potential signaling pathways and functions remain unknown. Here, our objective is to figure out the functional molecules and signaling pathways by analyzing the RNA-seq data. The GSE189379 was produced by the Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens). The KEGG and GO analyses showed that focal adhesion and proteoglycans are the mainly affected processes in prostate cancer with the loss of AZIN1. Moreover, we identified ten key molecules including FN1, HRAS, CCND1, RAD51, PCNA, TYMS, CASP3, RRM2, BIRC5, and CCNE2. Therefore, this study provides novel knowledge of AZIN1 mediated prostate cancer.","Articular cartilage has only very limited regenerative capacities in humans. Tissue engineering techniques for cartilage damage repair are limited in the production of hyaline cartilage. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) are multipotent stem cells and can be differentiated into mature cartilage cells, chondrocytes, which could be used for repairing damaged cartilage. Chondrogenesis is a highly complex, relatively inefficient process lasting over 3 weeks in vitro. In order to better understand chondrogenic differentiation, especially the commitment phase, we have performed transcriptional profiling of MSC differentiation into chondrocytes from early timepoints starting 15 minutes after induction to 16 hours and fully differentiated chondrocytes at 21 days. Transcriptional gene regulatory networks (GRN) were identified using time-course clustering and upstream-regulator predictions which revealed that cells start epigenetic reprogramming as early as 2 hours after induction and commit to differentiation within 4-6 hours. After that they adapt their gene expression to cater for differentiation specific protein production. These results suggest that interventions to improve the frequency and efficiency of differentiation should target early processes.","Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, demyelinating disease in which the neuron myelin sheath is disrupted and leading to signal transductions disabilities. The evidence demonstrated that gene expression patterns and their related regulating factors are the most critical agents in Multiple Sclerosis demyelinating process. A miRNA is a small non-coding RNA which functions in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Identification of specific miRNA dysregulation patterns in multiple sclerosis blood samples compared to healthy control can be used as a diagnostic and prognostic agent. Through the literature review and bioinformatics analysis, it was found that the hsa-miR-106a-5p can be considered as a significant MS pathogenic factor, which seems has an abnormal expression pattern in patients\u2019 blood. Experimental validation using Real-Time PCR assay was carried to verifying the miR-106a-5p expression in Multiple Sclerosis and healthy control blood samples. The obtained results proved the miR-106a dysregulation in MS patients. The expression levels of miR-106a-5p were significantly down-regulated (Fold change=0.44) in patient blood samples compared to controls (p=0.059). Our study suggested that miR-106a-5p may have a biomarker potential to the diagnosis of MS patients based on its dysregulation patterns in Multiple Sclerosis blood.","Colonoid cultures were established from histologically-normal human colon tissue and maintained in a low-calcium (0.25 mM) medium or in medium supplemented with an amount of calcium (1.5 - 3.0 mM) that was shown in a previous study to induce differentiation in colonoids derived from large adenomas. Calcium alone was compared to Aquamin, a multi-mineral natural product that contains magnesium and detectable levels of 72 additional trace elements in addition to calcium. Unlike the previously-studied tumor-derived colonoids (which remained un-differentiated in the absence of calcium-supplementation), normal tissue colonoids underwent differentiation as indicated by gross and microscopic appearance, a low proliferative index and high-level expression of cytokeratin 20 (CK20) in the absence of intervention. Only modest additional changes were seen in these parameters with either calcium alone or Aquamin (providing up to 3.0 mM calcium). In spite of this, proteomic analysis and immunohistochemistry revealed that both interventions induced strong up-regulation of proteins that promote cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesive functions, barrier formation and tissue integrity. Transmission electron microscopy revealed an increase in desmosomes in response to intervention. These findings demonstrate that histologically normal human colonoids can undergo differentiation in the presence of a low ambient calcium concentration. However, higher calcium levels can induce elaboration of proteins that promote cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion. These changes could lead to improved barrier function and improved colon tissue health.","Background The rapid growth of high-throughput sequencing-based microbiome profiling has yielded tremendous insights into human health and physiology. Data generated from high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons are often preprocessed into composition or relative abundance. However, reproducibility has been lacking due to the myriad of different experimental and computational approaches taken in these studies. Microbiome studies may report varying results on the same topic, therefore, meta-analyses examining different microbiome studies to provide robust results are important. So far, there is still a lack of implemented methods to properly examine differential relative abundances of microbial taxonomies and to perform meta-analysis examining the heterogeneity and overall effects across microbiome studies.","Osteocyte produced fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is the key regulator of serum phosphate (Pi) homeostasis. The interplay between parathyroid hormone (PTH), FGF23 and other proteins that regulate FGF23 production and serum Pi levels is complex and incompletely characterised. Evidence suggests that the protein product of the SOST gene, sclerostin (SCL), also a PTH target and also produced by osteocytes, plays a role in FGF23 expression, however the mechanism for this effect is unclear. Part of the problem of understanding the interplay of these mediators is the complex multi-organ system that achieves Pi homeostasis in vivo. In the current study, we sought to address this using a unique cell line model of the osteocyte, IDG-SW3, known to express FGF23 at both the mRNA and protein levels. In cultures of differentiated IDG-SW3 cells, both PTH1-34 and recombinant human (rh) SCL remarkably induced Fgf23 mRNA expression dose-dependently within 3 hours. Both rhPTH1-34 and rhSCL also strongly induced C-terminal FGF23 protein secretion. Secreted intact FGF23 levels remained unchanged, consistent with constitutive post-translational cleavage of FGF23 in this cell model. Both rhPTH1-34 and rhSCL treatments significantly suppressed mRNA levels of Phex, Dmp1 and Enpp1 mRNA, encoding putative negative regulators of FGF23 levels, and induced Galnt3 mRNA expression, encoding N-acetylgalactosaminyl-transferase 3 (GalNAc-T3), which protects FGF23 from furin-like proprotein convertase-mediated cleavage. The effect of both rhPTH1-34 and rhSCL was antagonised by pre-treatment with the NF-\u03ba\u03b2 signalling inhibitors, BAY11 and TPCK. RhSCL also stimulated FGF23 mRNA expression in ex vivo cultures of human bone. These findings provide evidence for the direct regulation of FGF23 expression by sclerostin. Locally expressed sclerostin via the induction of FGF23 in osteocytes thus has the potential to contribute to the regulation of Pi homeostasis.","Stop codon readthrough (SCR) occurs when the ribosome miscodes at a stop codon. Such readthrough events can be therapeutically desirable when a premature termination codon (PTC) is found in a critical gene. To study SCR in vivo in a genome-wide manner, we treated mammalian cells with aminoglycosides and performed ribosome profiling. We find that in addition to stimulating readthrough of PTCs, aminoglycosides stimulate readthrough of normal termination codons (NTCs) genome-wide. Stop codon identity, the nucleotide following the stop codon, and the surrounding mRNA sequence context all influence the likelihood of SCR. In comparison to NTCs, downstream stop codons in 3\u2032UTRs are recognized less efficiently by ribosomes, suggesting that targeting of critical stop codons for readthrough may be achievable without general disruption of translation termination. Finally, we find that G418 treatment globally alters gene expression with substantial effects on translation of histone genes, selenoprotein genes, and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AMD1).","Background Clinical recommendations to limit gestational weight gain (GWG) imply high GWG is causally related to adverse outcomes in mother or offspring, but GWG is the sum of several inter-related complex phenotypes (maternal fat deposition and vascular expansion, placenta, amniotic fluid and fetal growth). Understanding the genetic contribution to GWG could help clarify the potential effect of its different components on maternal and offspring health. Here we explore the genetic contribution to total, early and late GWG.","REV-ERB\u03b1 is a nuclear hormone receptor that plays important role in the regulation of many physiological processes such as circadian clock regulation, inflammation, and metabolism. Despite its importance, few chemical tools are available to study this receptor. In addition, there is no available X-ray crystal structures of REV-ERB bound with synthetic ligands, hampering the development of targeted therapeutics. SR8278 is the only identified synthetic antagonist of REV-ERB. We have performed Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (GaMD) simulations to sample the binding pathway of SR8278 and associated conformational changes to REV-ERB\u03b1. The simulations revealed a novel and more energetically favorable conformational state than the starting conformation. The new conformation allows ligand binding to the orthosteric binding site in a specific orientation. This state is reached after a tryptophan (Trp436) rotameric switch coupled with H3-H6 distance change. We used the newly identified GaMD conformational state in structure-based virtual screening of one million compounds library which led to the identification of novel REV-ERB\u03b1 antagonist. This study is the first that demonstrates a synthetic ligand binding pathway to REV-ERB\u03b1, which provided important insights into the REV-ERB\u03b1 functional mechanism and lead to the discovery of novel REV-ERB\u03b1 antagonists. This study further emphasizes the power of computational chemistry methods in advancing drug discovery research.","Hematopoiesis changes over life to meet the demands of maturation and aging. Here, we find that the definitive hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) compartment is remodeled from gestation into adulthood, a process regulated by the heterochronic Lin28b/let-7 axis. Native fetal and neonatal HSPCs distribute with a pro-lymphoid/erythroid bias with a shift toward myeloid output in adulthood. By mining transcriptomic data comparing juvenile and adult HSPCs and reconstructing coordinately activated gene regulatory networks, we uncover the Polycomb repressor complex 1 (PRC1) component Cbx2 as an effector of Lin28b/let-7\u2019s control of hematopoietic maturation. We find that juvenile Cbx2-/- hematopoietic tissues show impairment of B-lymphopoiesis and a precocious adult-like myeloid bias and that Cbx2/PRC1 regulates developmental timing of expression of key hematopoietic transcription factors. These findings define a novel mechanism of epigenetic regulation of HSPC output as a function of age with potential impact on age-biased pediatric and adult blood disorders.","Mediator of Cell Motility 1 (MEMO1) is an ubiquitously expressed modulator of cellular responses to growth factors including FGF23 signaling, and Memo1-deficient mice share some phenotypic traits with Fgf23- or Klotho-deficient mouse models. Here, we tested whether Memo1 gene expression is regulated by calciotropic hormones or by changing the dietary mineral load.","The gastrointestinal (GI) tract constitutes an essential barrier against ingested pathogens. While immune reactions are well-studied in the lower GI tract, it remains unclear how adaptive immune responses are initiated during microbial challenge of the oral mucosa, the primary site of pathogen encounter in the upper GI tract. Here, we identify mandibular lymph nodes (mandLN) as sentinel lymphoid organs that collect orally administered Listeria monocytogenes (Lm), leading to local CD8+ T cell activation. In contrast to CD8+ T effector cells (TEFF) generated in mesenteric lymph nodes, mandLN CD8+ TEFF lacked a gut-seeking phenotype but contributed to systemic host protection. Accordingly, mandLN stromal and dendritic cells expressed low levels of enzymes required for gut homing imprinting. Our findings extend the concept of regional specialization of immune responses along the length of the GI tract, with mandLN acting as oral lymph-draining counterparts of intestinal lymph-draining LN of the lower GI tract.","Background The viral entry of SARS-CoV-2 requires host-expressed TMPRSS2 to facilitate the viral spike (S) protein priming.","Multifactorial metabolic diseases, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, are a major burden of modern societies and frequently present with no clearly defined molecular biomarkers. Herein we used systems medicine approaches to decipher signatures of liver fibrosis in mouse models with malfunction in genes from unrelated biological pathways. Enrichment analyses of KEGG, Reactome and TRANSFAC databases complemented with genome-scale metabolic modelling revealed fibrotic signatures highly similar to liver pathologies in humans. The diverse genetic models of liver fibrosis exposed a common transcriptional programme with activated ER\u03b1 signalling, and a network of interactions between regulators of lipid metabolism and transcription factors from cancer pathways and immune system. The novel hallmarks of fibrosis are downregulated lipid pathways, including fatty acid, bile acid, and steroid hormone metabolism. Moreover, distinct metabolic subtypes of liver fibrosis were proposed, supported by unique enrichment of transcription factors based on the type of insult, disease stage, or sex.","Dysregulation of Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling may contribute to multiple Down syndrome-associated phenotypes, including cerebellar hypoplasia, congenital heart defects, craniofacial and skeletal dysmorphologies, and Hirschsprung disease. Granule cell precursors isolated from the developing cerebellum of Ts65Dn mice are less responsive to the mitogenic effects of SHH than euploid cells, and a single postnatal dose of the SHH pathway agonist SAG rescues cerebellar morphology and performance on learning and memory tasks in Ts65Dn mice. SAG treatment also normalizes expression levels of OLIG2 in neural progenitor cells derived from human trisomy 21 iPSCs. However, despite evidence that activating SHH signaling can ameliorate some Down syndrome-associated phenotypes, chromosome 21 does not encode any components of the canonical SHH pathway. Here, we screened 163 chromosome 21 cDNAs in a series of SHH-responsive cell lines to identify chromosome 21 genes that modulate SHH signaling. We confirmed overexpression of trisomic candidate genes using RNA-seq in Ts65Dn and TcMAC21 cerebellum. Our study indicates that some chromosome 21 genes, including DYRK1A, upregulate SHH signaling while others, such as HMGN1 and MIS18A, inhibit SHH signaling. Overexpression of genes involved in chromatin structure and mitosis, but not genes previously implicated in ciliogenesis, regulate the SHH pathway. Our data suggest that cerebellar hypoplasia and other phenotypes related to aberrant SHH signaling arise from the net effect of trisomy for multiple chromosome 21 genes rather than the overexpression of a single trisomic gene. Identifying which chromosome 21 genes modulate SHH signaling may suggest new therapeutic avenues for ameliorating Down syndrome phenotypes.","Studies attempting to functionally interpret complex-disease susceptibility loci by GWAS and eQTL integration have predominantly employed microarrays to quantify gene-expression. RNA-Seq has the potential to discover a more comprehensive set of eQTLs and illuminate the underlying molecular consequence. We examine the functional outcome of 39 variants associated with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) through integration of GWAS and eQTL data from the TwinsUK microarray and RNA-Seq cohort in lymphoblastoid cell lines. We use conditional analysis and a Bayesian colocalisation method to provide evidence of a shared causal-variant, then compare the ability of each quantification type to detect disease relevant eQTLs and eGenes. We discovered a greater frequency of candidate-causal eQTLs using RNA-Seq, and identified novel SLE susceptibility genes that were concealed using microarrays (e.g. NADSYN1, SKP1, and TCF7). Many of these eQTLs were found to influence the expression of several genes, suggesting risk haplotypes may harbour multiple functional effects. We pinpointed eQTLs modulating expression of four non-coding RNAs; three of which were replicated in whole-blood. Novel SLE associated splicing events were identified in the T-reg restricted transcription factor, IKZF2, the autophagy-related gene WDFY4, and the redox coenzyme NADSYN1, through asQTL mapping using the Geuvadis cohort. We have significantly increased our understanding of the genetic control of gene-expression in SLE by maximising the leverage of RNA-Seq and performing integrative GWAS-eQTL analysis against gene, exon, and splice-junction quantifications. In doing so, we have identified novel SLE candidate genes and specific molecular mechanisms that will serve as the basis for targeted follow-up studies.","Transcription factors (TFs) are crucial for regulating cell differentiation during the development of the immune system. However, the key TFs for orchestrating the specification of distinct immune cells are not fully understood. Here, we integrated the transcriptomic and epigenomic measurements in 73 mouse and 61 human primary cell types, respectively, that span the immune cell differentiation pathways. We constructed the cell-type-specific transcriptional regulatory network and assessed the global importance of TFs based on the Taiji framework, which is a method we have previously developed that can infer the global impact of TFs using integrated transcriptomic and epigenetic data. Integrative analysis across cell types revealed putative driver TFs in cell lineage-specific differentiation in both mouse and human systems. We have also identified TF combinations that play important roles in specific developmental stages. Furthermore, we validated the functions of predicted novel TFs in murine CD8+ T cell differentiation and showed the importance of Elf1 and Prdm9 in the effector versus memory T cell fate specification and Kdm2b and Tet3 in promoting differentiation of CD8+ tissue resident memory (Trm) cells, validating the approach. Thus, we have developed a bioinformatic approach that provides a global picture of the regulatory mechanisms that govern cellular differentiation in the immune system and aids the discovery of novel mechanisms in cell fate decisions.","Fibrotic lesions accompany several pathological conditions including tumors. We show that expression of a dominant-active form of the Ras oncogene in Drosophila salivary glands (SGs) leads to redistribution of components of the basement membrane (BM) and fibrotic lesions. Similar to several types of mammalian fibrosis, the disturbed BM attracts clot components including insect transglutaminase and phenoloxidase. SG epithelial cells show reduced apico-basal polarity accompanied by a loss of secretory activity. Both the fibrotic lesions and the reduced cell polarity are alleviated by ectopic expression of the antimicrobial peptide Drosomycin (Drs), which also restores secretory activity of the SGs. In addition to ECM components, both Drs and F-actin localize to fibrotic lesions.","  The ultrafast photoinduced ring-opening of 1,3-cyclohexadiene constitutes a\ntextbook example of electrocyclic reactions in organic chemistry and a model\nfor photobiological reactions in vitamin D synthesis. Here, we present direct\nand unambiguous observation of the ring-opening reaction path on the\nfemtosecond timescale and sub-{\\AA}ngstr\\\"om length scale by megaelectronvolt\nultrafast electron diffraction. We follow the carbon-carbon bond dissociation\nand the structural opening of the 1,3-cyclohexadiene ring by direct measurement\nof time-dependent changes in the distribution of interatomic distances. We\nobserve a substantial acceleration of the ring-opening motion after internal\nconversion to the ground state due to steepening of the electronic potential\ngradient towards the product minima. The ring-opening motion transforms into\nrotation of the terminal ethylene groups in the photoproduct 1,3,5-hexatriene\non the sub-picosecond timescale. Our work demonstrates the potential of\nmegaelectronvolt ultrafast electron diffraction to elucidate photochemical\nreaction paths in organic chemistry.\n","Background Recent development of single cell sequencing technologies has made it possible to identify genes with different expression (DE) levels at the cell type level between different groups of samples. In this article, we propose to borrow information through known biological networks to increase statistical power to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs).","Data from adult studies how that COVID-19 is more severe in men than women. However, no data are available for the pediatric population. For this reason, we performed this study aiming to understand if sex influenced disease severity and outcomes in a large cohort of latin-american children with COVID-19 and Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C). We found that a higher percentage of male children developed MIS-C (8.9% vs 5% in females) and died (1.2% and 0.4% in females), although on multivariate adjusted analyses the only statistically significant difference was found in need of hospitalization, with females less frequently admitted compared with boys (25.6% vs 35.4%). This data are preliminary and need further independent studies to better assess the role of sex.","The presented experiment focuses on assessing the impact of HMB (hydroxy-\u03b2-methobutyrate) supplementation of mothers during pregnancy on the development of the skeletal system of their offspring. For this purpose, an experiment was carried out on 12 clinically healthy sows of the Great White Poland breed, which were divided randomly into two groups the control and the HMB group. All animals were kept under standard conditions and received the same feed for pregnant females. In contrast, females from the HMB group between 70 and 90 days were supplemented with 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyle in the amount of 0.2g/kg b.w/day. Immediately after birth, the piglets were also divided into groups based on: sex, and presence or lack HMB supplementation, and subsequently were euthanized and humerus bones from all piglets were collected.","Rationale Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) has a devastating impact on global health. Mtb is the causative agent of human pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), which claims 1.4 million lives per annum. During infection, differentially culturable bacilli (DCB) that fail to produce colonies on solid media but grow in liquid media supplemented with resuscitation-promoting factor (Rpf) proteins are formed. These Rpf-dependent mycobacteria are a major barrier to developing improved TB treatments and diagnostic tools.","OBJECTIVE To study the accumulation of MS-risk resulting from different combinations of MS-associated conserved-extended-haplotypes of the MHC and three non-MHC risk-loci nearby genes EOMES, ZFP36L1, CLEC16A.","Human Angiotensin I Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) that acts as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry is highly expressed in human type II pneumocytes and enterocytes and similarly in other mammals and zebrafish (Danio rerio). The zebrafish genome has a highly conserved, one-to-one ortholog of ACE2, i.e., ace2, whose expression profile however has not yet been studied during development or in pathologies relevant to COVID-19. Herein, we identified significant development-, tissue- and gender-specific modulations in ace2 expression based on meta-analysis of zebrafish Affymetrix transcriptomics datasets (ndatasets=107, GPL1319 in GEO database). Co-expression network analysis of ace2 revealed distinct positively correlated (carboxypeptidase activity and fibrin clot formation), and negatively correlated (cilia biogenesis/transport and chromatin modifications) STRING network modules. Using additional transcriptomics datasets, we showed zebrafish embryos before 3 days post fertilization (dpf) exhibited low levels of ace2 that increased significantly until 4 dpf implicating a role for ace2 in organogenesis. Re-analysis of RNA-seq datasets from zebrafish adult tissues demonstrated ace2 was expressed highly in intestines, variably in liver, and at lower levels in other organs. In addition, zebrafish females and males showed significant dimorphism in their age-dependent expression of ace2, and between ovary and testis where the latter had higher levels. Moreover, we demonstrated ace2 expression was significantly modulated under different physiological and pathological conditions associated with development, diet, infection, and inflammation. Our findings implicate a novel translational role for zebrafish ace2 in differentiation and pathologies predominantly found in intestines and liver, in which the effects of SARS-CoV-2 could be detrimental.","Objective Inflammation and calcification are major factors responsible for failure of bioprosthetic valve and other substitute heart valve implantations. The objective of this study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory and anti-calcification effects of Entelon150\u00ae (consisting of grape-seed extract) in a beagle dog model of intravascular bovine pericardium implantation.","Highly pathogenic respiratory viruses such as 1918 influenza (HIN1) and coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) induce significant lung injury with diffuse alveolar damage, capillary leak, and extensive cell death resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Direct effects of the virus, as well as host immune response such as proinflammatory cytokine production, contribute to programmed cell death or apoptosis. Alveolar lung epithelial type II (AT2) cells play a major role in the clearance of respiratory viruses, secretion of surfactant proteins and antimicrobial substances into the bronchoalveolar fluid as well as repair of lung injury. Gene expression in AT2 cells is regulated in a tissue and cell-specific manner and in a temporal fashion. The availability of tissue and cell-specific RNA datasets in Human Protein Atlas led to the identification of localized expression patterns of BCL-2 family members such as BCL2 related protein A1 (BCL2A1) in AT2 cells and immune cells of the lung. BCL2A1 expression was regulated by multiple stimuli including Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands, interferons (IFNs), inflammatory cytokines, and inhibited by the steroid dexamethasone. In this study, regulation of BCL2A1 gene expression in human lung epithelial cells by several respiratory viruses and type I interferon signaling was investigated. SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly induced BCL2A1 expression in human lung epithelial cells within 24 hours that required the expression of Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). BCL2A1 mRNA induction by SARS-CoV-2 was correlated with the induced expression of IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-regulated transcription factor mRNA. BCL2A1 was induced by IFN-\u03b2 treatment or by infection with influenza virus lacking the non-structural protein1(NS1) in NHBE cells. Furthermore, bioinformatics revealed that a subset of BCL-2 family members involved in the control of apoptosis and transcription such as BCL2A1, BCL2L14, BCL3, and BCL6 were regulated in the lung epithelial cells by coronaviruses and in the lung tissue samples of COVID-19 patients. Transcriptomic data also suggested that these genes were differentially regulated by the steroid drug dexamethasone.","Identifying genes underlying complex diseases remains a major challenge. Biomarkers are typically identified by comparing average levels of gene expression in populations of healthy and diseased individuals. However, genetic diversities may undermine the effort to uncover genes with significant but individual contribution to the spectrum of disease phenotypes within a population. Here we leverage the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel (HMDP), a model system of 100+ genetically diverse strains of mice exhibiting different complex disease traits, to develop a personalized differential gene expression analysis that is able to identify disease-associated genes missed by traditional population-wide methods. The population-level and personalized approaches are compared for isoproterenol(ISO)-induced cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure using pre- and post-ISO gene expression and phenotypic data. The personalized approach identifies 36 Fold-Change (FC) genes predictive of the severity of cardiac hypertrophy, and enriched in genes previously associated with cardiac diseases in human. Strikingly, these genes are either up- or down-regulated at the individual strain level, and are therefore missed when averaging at the population level. Using insights from the gene regulatory network and protein-protein interactome, we identify Hes1 as a strong candidate FC gene. We validate its role by showing that even a mild knockdown of 20-40% of Hes1 can induce a dramatic reduction of hypertrophy by 80-90% in rat neonatal cardiac cells. These findings emphasize the importance of a personalized approach to identify causal genes underlying complex diseases as well as to develop personalized therapies.","Gastrointestinal strongyles are a major threat to horses' health and welfare. Given that strongyles inhabit the same niche as the gut microbiota, they may interact with each other. These beneficial or detrimental interactions are unknown in horses and could partly explain contrasted susceptibility to infection between individuals. To address these questions, an experimental pasture trial with 20 worm-free female Welsh ponies (10 susceptible (S) and 10 resistant (R) to parasite infection) was implemented for five months. Fecal egg counts (FEC), hematological and biochemical data, body weight and gut microbiota composition were studied in each individual after 0, 24, 43, 92 and 132 grazing days.","Murine models describe a defined host/pathogen interaction for urinary tract infection, but human cell studies are scant. Although recent human urothelial organoid models are promising, none demonstrate long-term tolerance to urine, the natural substrate of the tissue and of the uropathogens that live there. We developed a novel human organoid from progenitor cells which demonstrates key structural hallmarks and biomarkers of the urothelium. After three weeks of transwell culture with 100% urine at the apical interface, the organoid stratified into multiple layers. The apical surface differentiated into enlarged and flattened umbrella-like cells bearing characteristic tight junctions, structures resembling asymmetric unit membrane plaques, and a glycosaminoglycan layer. The apical cells also expressed apical cytokeratin-20, a spatial feature of the mammalian urothelium. Urine itself was necessary for full development, and undifferentiated cells were urine-tolerant despite the lack of membrane plaques and a glycosaminoglycan layer. Infection with Enterococcus faecalis revealed the expected invasive outcome, including urothelial sloughing and the formation of intracellular colonies similar to those previously observed in patient cells. This new biomimetic model could help illuminate invasive behaviours of uropathogens, and serve as a reproducible test bed for disease formation, treatment and resolution in patients.","Age-related frailty is a significant health and social care burden, however treatment options are limited. There is currently a lack of suitable cell culture model for screening large numbers of test compounds to identifying those which can potentially promote healthy skeletal muscle function. This paper describes the characterization of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) signalling changes in young and aged myoblasts and myotubes using the C2C12 cell line, and the application of aged myoblast and myotube cultures to assess the effect of dietary polyphenols on RONS signalling. Aged myoblasts and myotubes were observed to have significantly increased reactive oxygen species levels (p&lt;0.01 and p&lt;0.001 respectively), increases in nitric oxide levels (p&lt;0.05 for myoblasts and myotubes), and lipid peroxidation markers (p&lt;0.05 for myoblasts and myotubes). A panel of nine polyphenols were assessed in aged myoblasts and myotubes using concentrations and incubation times consistent with known pharmacokinetic parameters for these compounds. Of these, although several polyphenols were seen to reduce single markers of RONS signalling, only kaempferol and resveratrol consistently reduced multiple markers of RONS signalling with statistical significance in both cell models. Modulation of cellular enzymatic antioxidant activities (superoxide and catalase) was assessed as a possible mechanism of action for these polyphenols, and although both superoxide and catalase activities were significantly reduced in aged (versus young) myotubes (p&lt;0.01 and p&lt;0.05 respectively), no effect of polyphenol treatment on these enzyme activities were observed. Overall, this research has shown the utility of the C2C12 model, as both myoblasts and myotubes, as a suitable cell model for screening compounds for modulating RONS signalling in aged muscle, and that resveratrol and kaempferol (using pharmacokinetically-informed exposures) can modulate RONS signalling in skeletal muscle cells after an acute exposure.","Cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 trigger inflammatory cascades which may play a role in the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease (CKD)-associated cachexia. CKD was induced by 5/6 nephrectomy in mice. We studied energy homeostasis in Il1\u03b2\u2212/\u2212/CKD, Il6\u2212/\u2212/CKD and Tnf\u03b1\u2212/\u2212/CKD mice and compared with wild type (WT)/CKD controls. Parameters of cachexia phenotype were completely normalized in Il1\u03b2\u2212/\u2212/CKD mice but were only partially rescued in Il6\u2212/\u2212/CKD and Tnf\u03b1\u2212/\u2212/CKD mice. We tested the effects of anakinra, an IL-1 receptor antagonist, on CKD-associated cachexia. WT/CKD mice were treated with anakinra (2.5 mg.kg.day, IP) or saline for 6 weeks and compared with WT/sham controls. Anakinra normalized food intake and weight gain, fat and lean mass content, metabolic rate and muscle function, and also attenuated molecular perturbations of energy homeostasis in adipose tissue and muscle in WT/CKD mice. Anakinra attenuated browning of white adipose tissue in WT/CKD mice. Moreover, anakinra normalized gastrocnemius weight and fiber size as well as attenuated muscle fat infiltration in WT/CKD mice. This was accompanied by correcting the increased muscle wasting signaling pathways while promoting the decreased myogenesis process in gastrocnemius of WT/CKD mice. We performed qPCR analysis for the top 20 differentially expressed muscle genes previously identified via RNAseq analysis in WT/CKD mice versus controls. Importantly, 17 differentially expressed muscle genes were attenuated in anakinra treated WT/CKD mice. In conclusion, IL-1 receptor antagonism may represent a novel targeted treatment for adipose tissue browning and muscle wasting in CKD.","Cytokine storm is a primary cause for multiple organ damage and death after severe infections, such as SARS-CoV-2. However, current single cytokine-targeted strategies display limited therapeutic efficacy. Here, we report that peritoneal M2 macrophages-derived extracellular vesicles (M2-EVs) are multi-target nanotherapeutics to resolve cytokine storm. In detail, primary peritoneal M2 macrophages exhibited superior anti-inflammatory potential than immobilized cell lines. Systemically administrated M2-EVs entered major organs and were taken up by phagocytes (e.g., macrophages). M2-EVs treatment effectively reduced excessive cytokine (e.g., TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6) release in vitro and in vivo, thereby attenuated oxidative stress and multiple organ (lung, liver, spleen and kidney) damage in endotoxin-induced cytokine storm. Moreover, M2-EVs simultaneously inhibited multiple key proinflammatory pathways (e.g., NF-\u03baB, JAK-STAT and p38 MAPK) by regulating complex miRNA-gene and gene-gene networks, and this effect was collectively mediated by many functional cargos (miRNAs and proteins) in EVs. In addition to the direct anti-inflammatory role, human peritoneal M2-EVs expressed angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and thus could serve as nanodecoys to prevent SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection in vitro. As cell-derived nanomaterials, the therapeutic index of M2-EVs can be further improved by genetic/chemical modification or loading with specific drugs. This study highlights that peritoneal M2-EVs are promising multifunctional nanotherapeutics to attenuate infectious diseases-related cytokine storm.","The predominant view in structure-based drug design is that small-molecule ligands, once bound to their target structures, display a well-defined binding mode. While this is convenient from a design perspective, it ignores the fact that structural stability (robustness) is not necessary for thermodynamic stability (binding affinity). In fact, any potential benefit of a rigid binding mode will have to be balanced against the entropic penalty that it entails. Surprisingly, little is known about the causes, consequences and real degree of robustness of protein-ligand complexes. Here we investigate two diverse sets of structures, comprising 79 drug-like and 27 fragment ligands, respectively. We focus on hydrogen bond interactions (469 in total), as they have been described as essential for structural stability. We find that 75% of complexes are anchored by at least one robust hydrogen bond, the remaining 25% either form loose complexes or are constrained by other interactions types. The first type of complexes generally combine a single anchoring point with looser regions, thus balancing order and disorder. Completely constricted protein-ligand complexes are rare and seem to fulfil a functional necessity. Structural stability analysis reveals a hidden layer of complexity in protein-ligand complexes that should be considered in ligand design.","Glucocorticoid (GC) administration is an effective therapy commonly used in the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. However, the use of GC can give rise to serious complications. The main detrimental side effect of GC therapy is significant bone loss, resulting in glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP).","Staphylococcus aureus infections pose a potential threat to livestock production and public health. A novel strategy is needed to control S. aureus infection due to its adaptive evolution to antibiotics. Autophagy plays a key role in degrading bacteria for innate immune cells. In order to promote S. aureus clearance via TLR induced autophagy pathway, the domain fusion TLR2-4 with the extracellular domain of TLR2, specific recognizing S. aureus, and transmembrane and intracellular domains of TLR4 is assembled, then the goats expressing TLR2-4 is generated. TLR2-4 substantially augments the removal of S. aureus within macrophages by elevating autophagy level. Phosphorylated JNK/ERK1/2 promote LC3- puncta in TLR2-4 macrophages during S. aureus-induced autophagy via MyD88-mediated the TAK1 signaling cascade. Meantime, the TRIF-dependent TBK1-TFEB-OPTN signaling is involved in TLR2-4-triggered autophagy after S. aureus challenge. Moreover, the transcript of ATG5 and ATG12 is significantly increased via cAMP-PKA-NF-\u03baB signaling, which facilitates S. aureus-induced autophagy in TLR2-4 macrophages. Overall, the novel receptor TLR2-4 enhances the autophagy-dependent clearance of S. aureus in macrophages via TAK1/TBK1-JNK/ERK, TBK1-TFEB-OPTN and cAMP-PKA-NF-\u03baB-ATGs signaling pathways, which provide an alternative approach to resistant against S. aureus infection.","Many aquatically respiring animals inhabiting low pH waters can suffer acute inhibition of ion uptake and loss of branchial (gill) epithelial integrity, culminating in a fatal, rapid loss of body Na+. Environmental calcium levels ([Ca2+]e) are pivotal in maintaining branchial junction integrity, with supplemental Ca2+ reversing the negative effects of low pH in some animals. Tolerance of some naturally acidic environments by aquatic animals is further complicated by low [Ca2+]e, yet many of these environments are surprisingly biodiverse. How these animals overcome the combined damaging actions of low pH and low environmental Ca2+ remains unknown. Here, we examined the effects of [Ca2+]e on the response to low pH in larvae of the highly acid tolerant frog Limnodynastes terraereginae. Acute exposure to low pH water in the presence of low [Ca2+]e increased net Na+ efflux. Provision of additional [Ca2+]e reduced net Na+ efflux, but the effect was saturable. Acclimation to both low and high [Ca2+]e improved the resistance of larvae to Na+ efflux at low pH. Inhibition of apical Ca2+ uptake by ruthenium red resulted in an abrupt loss of tolerance to low pH in larvae acclimated to low pH water. Acclimation to acidic water increased branchial gene expression of the intracellular Ca2+ transport protein calbindin, consistent with a role for increased transcellular Ca2+ trafficking in the tolerance of acidic water. This study confirmed the physiological challenge of low [Ca2+]e on branchial integrity in acidic waters and highlighted a potential role for maintenance of transcellular Ca2+ uptake in the acid tolerance of L. terraereginae.","Most information about distal radius microstructure is based on the non-dominant forearm, with little known about the factors that contribute to bilateral asymmetries in the general population, or what factors may influence bilateral changes over time. Here, we analyzed bilateral longitudinal high resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HRpQCT) data collected over a 12-month period as part of a clinical trial that prescribed a well-controlled, compressive loading task to the nondominant forearm. Baseline data from 102 women age 21-40, and longitudinal data from 66 women who completed the 12-month trial, were examined to determine factors responsible for side-to-side asymmetries in bone structure and change in structure over time. Cross-sectionally, the dominant radius had 2.4%-2.7% larger cross-sectional area, trabecular area, and bone mineral content than the nondominant radius, but no other differences were noted. Those who more strongly favored their dominant arm had significantly more, thinner, closely spaced trabecular struts in their dominant versus nondominant radius. Individuals assigned to a loading intervention had significant bilateral gains in total bone mineral density (2.0% and 1.2% in the nondominant versus dominan sides), and unilateral gains in cortical area (3.1%), thickness (3.0%), bone mineral density (1.7%) and inner trabecular density (1.3%). Each of these gains were significantly predicted by loading dose, a metric that included bone strain, number of cycles, and strain rate. Within individuals, change was negatively associated with age, meaning that women closer to age 40 experienced less of a gain in bone versus those closer to age 21. We believe that dominant/nondominant asymmetries in bone structure reflect differences in habitual loads during growth and past ability to adapt, while response to loading reflects current individual physiologic capacity to adapt.","A \u03b3\u2013irradiated bovine albumin serum based nanoparticle was characterised structurally, and functionally. The nanoparticle was characterised by A.F.M, D.L.S, zeta potential, T.E.M., gel-electrophoresis, spectroscopy (UV-Vis, Fluorescence, FT-IR, and CD). Its stability was studied under adverse experimental conditions: pH values, chaotropic agents, and ionic strength and stability studies against time were mainly carried out by fluorescence spectroscopy following the changes in the tryptophan environment in the nanoparticle. Its function was studied by the interaction of the NP with the hydrophobic drug Emodin was studied. The binding and kinetic properties of the obtained complex were tested by biophysical methods as well as its toxicity in tumour cells.","The de novo biosynthesis of sterols is critical for eukaryotes, however, some organisms lack this pathway including most oomycetes. Phytophthora spp. are sterol auxotroph but remarkably, have retained a few genes encoding enzymes in the sterol biosynthesis pathway. Here we investigated the function of PcDHCR7, a gene in Phytophthora capsici predicted to encode the \u25b37-sterol reductase. When expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, PcDHCR7 showed a \u25b37-sterol reductase activity. Knocking out PcDHCR7 in P. capsici resulted in loss of the capacity to transform ergosterol into brassicasterol, which means PcDHCR7 has a \u25b37-sterol reductase activity in P. capsici itself. This enables P. capsici to transform sterols recruited from the environment for better use. Biological characteristics were compared between wild-type isolate and PcDHCR7 knock-out transformants. The results indicated that PcDHCR7 plays a key role in mycelium development and pathogenicity of zoospores in P. capsici.","The Nurses\u2019 Health Study (NHS), Nurses\u2019 Health Study II (NHSII), Health Professionals Follow Up Study (HPFS) and the Physicians Health Study (PHS) have collected detailed longitudinal data on multiple exposures and traits for approximately 310,000 study participants over the last 35 years. Over 160,000 study participants across the cohorts have donated a DNA sample and to date, 20,691 subjects have been genotyped as part of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of twelve primary outcomes. However, these studies utilized six different GWAS arrays making it difficult to conduct analyses of secondary phenotypes or share controls across studies. To allow for secondary analyses of these data, we have created three new datasets merged by platform family and performed imputation using a common reference panel, the 1,000 Genomes Phase I release. Here, we describe the methodology behind the data merging and imputation and present imputation quality statistics and association results from two GWAS of secondary phenotypes (body mass index (BMI) and venous thromboembolism (VTE)).","Stratified medicine requires discretisation of disease populations for targeted treatments. We have developed and applied a discrete Morse theory clustering algorithm to a Topological Data Analysis (TDA) network model of 498 gene expression profiles of peripheral blood from asthma and healthy participants. The Morse clustering algorithm defined nine clusters, BC1-9, representing molecular phenotypes with discrete phenotypes including Type-1, 2 &amp; 17 cytokine inflammatory pathways. The TDA network model and clusters were also characterised by activity of glucocorticoid receptor signalling associated with different expression profiles of glucocorticoid receptor (GR), according to microarray probesets targeted to the start or end of the GR mRNA\u2019s 3\u2019 UTR; suggesting differential GR mRNA processing as a possible driver of asthma phenotypes including steroid insensitivity.","Osteoporosis is a bone disease characterized by low bone density. The prevalence of osteoporosis varies between different populations and ethnic groups. Numerous studies have investigated the relationship between VDR gene polymorphisms and osteoporosis across ethnic populations. Present meta-analysis aims to comprehensively evaluate the influence of common FokI, BsmI, ApaI and TaqI VDR gene polymorphisms and osteoporosis. PubMed, Google Scholar, Springer Link and Elsevier databases were searched for eligible studies and all statistical calculations were performed by Open Meta-Analyst software. Studies investigated BsmI (65 studies; 6,880 case/ 8,049 control), ApaI (31 studies; 3,763 case/ 3,934 control), FokI (18 studies; 1,895 case/ 1,722 control), and TaqI (26 studies; 2,458 case/ 2,895 control) polymorphisms were included in the present meta-analysis. Results of meta-analysis revealed significant association between dominant model of FokI (ORff+Ff vs. FF= 1.19, 95% CI= 1.04-1.36, p= 0.01, I2= 39.36%) in overall analysis and recessive model of Caucasian population of TaqI polymorphism (ORTT+Tt vs. tt= 1.35, 95% CI= 1.11-1.63, p= 0.002, I2= 50.07%). While no such effect is found in any other genetic model in any other gene polymorphisms of the overall analyses or sub-group analyses. In conclusion, we found the FokI polymorphism is associated with osteoporosis in overall analysis, also the TaqI polymorphism is a risk factor for the Caucasian population.","A subset of boys with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) develop inflammatory demyelinating brain lesions. Risk factors are largely undefined. We used two independent cohorts to assess whether low vitamin D status predicts lesion development. In our first cohort, we measured 25-hydroxyvitamin D in 53 plasma samples from 20 pre-lesional ALD boys followed at two centers; half subsequently developed lesions. In our second cohort, we measured latitude (using home ZIP code) among 230 ALD boys in a database of 51 US pediatric hospitals; over half developed lesions. In regression models, low plasma vitamin D and northerly latitudes independently predicted ALD brain lesions.","Background Given its tolerance to stress and its richness in particular secondary metabolites, the tobacco tree, Nicotiana glauca, has been considered a promising biorefinery feedstock that would not be competitive with food and fodder crops.","In this study, we present an effective model All-Trans Retinoic Acid (ATRA)-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells. The model describes reinforcing feedback between an ATRA-inducible signalsome complex involving many proteins including Vav1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, and the activation of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. We decomposed the effective model into three modules; a signal initiation module that sensed and transformed an ATRA signal into program activation signals; a signal integration module that controlled the expression of upstream transcription factors; and a phenotype module which encoded the expression of functional differentiation markers from the ATRA-inducible transcription factors. We identified an ensemble of effective model parameters using measurements taken from ATRA-induced HL-60 cells. Using these parameters, model analysis predicted that MAPK activation was bistable as a function of ATRA exposure. Conformational experiments supported ATRA-induced bistability. Additionally, the model captured intermediate and phenotypic gene expression data. Knockout analysis suggested Gfi-1 and PPAR$[gamma] were critical to the ATRA-induced differentiation program. These findings, combined with other literature evidence, suggested that reinforcing feedback is central to hyperactive signaling in a diversity of cell fate programs.","The retinol dehydrogenase Rdh10 catalyzes the rate-limiting reaction that converts retinol into retinoic acid (RA), an autacoid that regulates energy balance and suppresses adiposity. Relative to WT, Rdh10+/\u2212 males experienced reduced fatty-acid oxidation, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. Running endurance decreased 40%. Rdh10+/\u2212 females increased reliance on fatty acid oxidation and did not experience glucose intolerance nor insulin resistance. Running endurance improved 2.2-fold. Estrogen increased, revealed by a 40% increase in uterine weight. Because skeletal muscle energy use restricts adiposity and insulin resistance, we assessed the mixed fiber type gastrocnemius muscle (GM) to determine the effects of endogenous RA on muscle metabolism in vivo. RA in Rdh10+/\u2212 male GM decreased 38% relative to WT. TAG content increased 1.7-fold. Glut1 mRNA and glucose decreased &gt;30%. Rdh10+/\u2212 male GM had impaired electron transport chain activity, and a 60% reduction in fasting ATP. The share of oxidative fibers increased, as did expression of the myogenic transcription factors Myog and Myf5. Centralized nuclei increased 5-fold in fibers\u2014indicating muscle malady or repair. In Rdh10+/\u2212 female GM, RA decreased only 17%, due to a 1.8-fold increase in the estrogen-induced retinol dehydrogenase, Dhrs9. Rdh10+/\u2212 female GM did not amass TAG, increase oxidative fibers, decrease Glut1 mRNA or glucose, nor increase centralized nuclei. Expression of Myog and Myf5 decreased. Electron transport chain activity increased, elevating fasting ATP &gt;3-fold. Thus, small decreases in skeletal muscle RA affect whole body energy use, insulin resistance and adiposity, in part through estrogen-related sexual dimorphic effects on mitochondria function.","Craniosynostosis (CRS) is a congenital abnormality deformity with a heterogenous genetic contribution. Previously, there are two attempts to collect genes that are genetically associated with craniosynostosis and some related syndromes with 57 (Twigg and Wilkie, 2015) and 39 (Goos and Mathijssen, 2019) genes identified, respectively. We expanded this list of craniosynostosis genes by adding another 17 genes with an updated literature search. These genes are shown to be more likely to be intolerant to functional mutations. Of these 113 craniosynostosis genes, 21 (19% vs. 1.5% baseline frequency) are cancer driver genes, a 14-fold enrichment. The cancer-craniosynostosis connection is further validated by an over-representation analysis of craniosynostosis genes in KEGG cancer pathway and several cancer related gene-sets. Many cancer-craniosynostosis overlapping genes participate in intracellular signaling pathways, which play a role in both development and cancer. This connection can be viewed from the oncogenesis recapitulates ontogenesis framework. Nineteen craniosynostosis genes are transcription factor genes (16.8% vs. 8.2% baseline), and craniosynostosis genes are also enriched in targets of certain transcription factors or micro RNAs.","A growing body of data suggests that the microbiome of a species can vary considerably from individual to individual, but the reasons for this variation - and the consequences for the ecology of these communities \u2013 remain only partially explained. In mammals, the emerging picture is that the metabolic state and immune system status of the host affects the composition of the microbiome, but quantitative ecological microbiome studies are challenging to perform in higher organisms. Here we show that these phenomena can be quantitatively analyzed in the tractable nematode host Caenorhabditis elegans. Mutants in innate immunity, in particular the DAF-2/Insulin Growth Factor (IGF) pathway, are shown to contain a microbiome that differs from that of wild type nematodes. We analyze the underlying basis of these differences from the perspective of community ecology by comparing experimental observations to the predictions of a neutral sampling model and conclude that fundamental differences in microbiome ecology underlie the observed differences in microbiome composition. We test this hypothesis by introducing a minor perturbation to the colonization conditions, allowing us to assess stability of communities in different host strains. Our results show that altering host immunity changes the importance of inter-species interactions within the microbiome, resulting in differences in community composition and stability that emerge from these differences in host-microbe ecology.","Chronic itch remains a highly prevalent disorder with limited treatment options. Most chronic itch diseases are thought to be driven by both the nervous and immune systems, but the fundamental molecular and cellular interactions that trigger the development of itch and the acute-to-chronic itch transition remain unknown. Here, we show that skin-infiltrating neutrophils are key initiators of itch in atopic dermatitis, the most prevalent chronic itch disorder. Neutrophil depletion significantly attenuated itch-evoked scratching in a mouse model of atopic dermatitis. Neutrophils were also required for several key hallmarks of chronic itch, including skin hyperinnervation, enhanced expression of itch signaling molecules, and upregulation of inflammatory cytokines, activity-induced genes, and markers of neuropathic itch. Finally, we demonstrate that neutrophils are required for induction of CXCL10, a ligand of the CXCR3 receptor that promotes itch via activation of sensory neurons, and we find that that CXCR3 antagonism attenuates chronic itch.","Background The development of effective treatments for multiple sclerosis (MS), and in particular its progressive forms, is hampered by the lack of etiologically relevant cellular and animal models of human disease. Models that recapitulate the biological and pathological processes leading to the onset and progression of MS in patients are likely to afford better translational efficacy. Following the discovery of the NR1H3 p.Arg415Gln pathogenic mutation for progressive MS in two Canadian families, we developed a knock-in mouse model harboring a homologous mutation in the endogenous gene to provide a more physiologically relevant model of human MS.","Phosphate overload contributes to mineral bone disorders associated with crystal nephropathies. Phytate, the major form of phosphorus in plant seeds, is known as an indigestible and negligible in humans. However, the mechanism and adverse effects of high-phytate intake on Ca2+ and phosphate absorption and homeostasis are unknown. Here we show that excessive intake of phytate with a low-Ca2+ diet fed to rats contributed to the development of crystal nephropathies, renal phosphate wasting, and bone loss through tubular dysfunction secondary to dysregulation of intestinal calcium and phosphate absorption. Moreover, Ca2+ supplementation alleviated the detrimental effects of excess dietary phytate on bone and kidney through excretion of undigested Ca2+-phytate, which prevented a vicious cycle of intestinal phosphate overload and renal phosphate wasting while improving intestinal Ca2+ bioavailability. Thus, we demonstrate that phytate is digestible without a high-Ca2+ diet and a risk factor for phosphate overloading and developing crystal nephropathies and bone disease.","Microgliosis is a prominent pathological feature in many neurological diseases including multiple sclerosis (MS). The precise role of microglia during demyelination, and the relative contributions of microglia vs. peripheral macrophages, are incompletely understood. Here, using a genetic fate mapping strategy, we identify microglia as predominant responders and key effectors of demyelination in the cuprizone (CUP) model. Pharmacological depletion of microglia demonstrates these cells are necessary for the demyelination, loss of oligodendrocytes, and reactive astrocytosis normally evident in this model. Electron microscopy (EM) and serial block face imaging show myelin sheaths remain intact in CUP treated mice depleted of microglia. However, these damaged myelin sheaths are lost upon-repopulation of microglia. Injection of colony-stimulating factor-1 to drive focal microgliosis in white matter is sufficient to induce focal demyelination in vivo. These studies indicate activated microglia are required for demyelination that results from primary myelin pathology and are sufficient to induce demyelination directly.","Background The natural triterpene celastrol exhibits potential anti-inflammatory activity in inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA).","Differentiation of multi-potent mesenchymal progenitor cells give rise to several tissue types including bone, cartilage, and adipose. In addition to the complication arising from the numerous spatial, temporal, and hormonal factors that regulate lineage allocation, targeting of these cells in vivo is challenging, making mesenchymal progenitor cell lines valuable tools to study both tissue development and the differentiated cell types. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be isolated from humans and animals; however, obtaining homogenous, responsive cells in a reproducible fashion can be problematic. As such, we have developed two novel mesenchymal progenitor cell (MPC) lines, MPC1 and MPC2, which were generated from the bone marrow of male C57BL/6 mice. These cells were immortalized using the temperature sensitive large T-antigen, allowing for thermal control of proliferation and differentiation. Both MPC1 and MPC2 cell lines are capable of osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic differentiation. Under osteogenic conditions both cell lines formed discrete mineralized nodules, staining for alizarin red and alkaline phosphatase, while expressing high levels of osteogenic genes including Sost, Fgf23, and Dmp1. Sost and Dmp1 mRNA levels were drastically reduced with parathyroid hormone, thus recapitulating in vivo responses. MPC cells secreted both the intact (iFGF23) and C-terminal (cFGF23) forms of endocrine hormone FGF23, which was upregulated in the presence of 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D (1,25D). In addition to osteogenic differentiation, both cell lines also rapidly entered the adipogenic lineage, expressing several adipose markers after only 4 days in adipogenic media. MPC cells were also capable of chondrogenic differentiation, displaying increased expression of common cartilage genes including aggrecan, sox9, and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein. With the ability to differentiate into multiple mesenchymal lineages and mimic in vivo responses of key regulatory genes/proteins, MPC cells are a valuable model to study factors that regulate mesenchymal lineage allocation as well as the mechanisms that dictate transcription, protein modification, and secretion of these factors.","The size of the human head is determined by growth in the first years of life, while the rest of the body typically grows until early adulthood1. Such complex developmental processes are regulated by various genes and growth pathways2. Rare genetic syndromes have revealed genes that affect head size3, but the genetic drivers of variation in head size within the general population remain largely unknown. To elucidate biological pathways underlying the growth of the human head, we performed the largest genome-wide association study on human head size to date (N = 79,107). We identified 67 genetic loci, 50 of which are novel, and found that these loci are preferentially associated with head size and mostly independent from height. In subsequent neuroimaging analyses, the majority of genetic variants demonstrated widespread effects on the brain, whereas the effects of 17 variants could be localized to one or two specific brain regions. Through hypothesis-free approaches, we find a strong overlap of head size variants with both cancer pathways and cancer genes. Gene set analyses showed enrichment for different types of cancer and the p53, Wnt and ErbB signalling pathway. Genes overlapping or close to lead variants \u2013 such as TP53, PTEN and APC \u2013 were enriched for genes involved in macrocephaly syndromes (up to 37-fold) and high-fidelity cancer genes (up to 9-fold), whereas this enrichment was not seen for human height variants. This indicates that genes regulating early brain and cranial growth are associated with a propensity to neoplasia later in life, irrespective of height. Our results warrant further investigations of the link between head size and cancer, as well as its clinical implications in the general population.","The most reliable predictor of future fracture risk is a previous fracture of any kind. The etiology of this increased fracture risk is not fully known, but it is possible that fracture initiates systemic bone loss leading to greater fracture risk at all skeletal sites. In this study we investigated systemic bone loss and recovery following femoral fracture in young (3 month old) and middle-aged (12 month old) mice. Transverse femur fractures were created using a controlled impact, and whole-body bone mineral density (BMD), trabecular and cortical microstructure, bone mechanical properties, bone formation and resorption rates, mouse voluntary movement, and systemic inflammation were quantified at multiple time points post-fracture. We found that fracture led to decreased whole-body BMD in both young and middle-aged mice 2 weeks post-fracture; this bone loss was recovered by 6 weeks in young, but not middle-aged mice. Similarly, trabecular bone volume fraction (BV/TV) of the L5 vertebral body was significantly reduced in fractured mice relative to control mice 2 weeks post-fracture (\u221211% for young mice, \u221218% for middle-aged mice); this bone loss was fully recovered by 6 weeks post-fracture in young mice. At 3 days post-fracture we observed significant increases in serum levels of interleukin-6 and significant decreases in voluntary movement in fractured mice compared to control mice, with considerably greater changes in middle-aged mice than in young mice. At this time point we also observed increased osteoclast number on L5 vertebral body trabecular bone of fractured mice compared to control mice. These data show that systemic bone loss occurs after fracture in both young and middle-aged mice, and recovery from this bone loss may vary with age. This systemic response could contribute to increased future fracture risk following fracture, and these data may inform clinical treatment of fractures with respect to improving long-term skeletal health.","Paget\u2019s Disease of Bone (PDB) is characterized by focal increases in disorganized bone remodeling. This study aims to characterize PDB associated changes in DNA methylation profiles in patients\u2019 blood. Meta-analysis of data from the discovery and replication set, comprising of 116 PDB cases and 130 controls, revealed significant differences in DNA methylation at 14 CpG sites, 4 CpG islands, and 6 gene-body regions. These loci, including two characterized as functional through eQTM analysis, were associated with functions related to osteoclast differentiation, mechanical loading, immune function, and viral infection. A multivariate classifier based on discovery samples was found to discriminate PDB cases and controls from the replication with a sensitivity of 0.84, specificity of 0.81, and an area under curve of 92.8%. In conclusion, this study has shown for the first time that epigenetic factors contribute to the pathogenesis of PDB and may offer diagnostic markers for prediction of the disease.","Cytochromes P450 located in the endoplasmic reticulum require NADPH cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (POR) for their catalytic activities. Mutations in POR cause multiple disorders in humans related to the biosynthesis of steroid hormones and also affect drug-metabolizing cytochrome P450 activities. Here we are reporting the effects of a POR genetic variant P284T which is located in the hinge region of POR that is necessary for the flexibility of domain movements. Human wild-type and P284T mutant of POR, as well as cytochrome P450 proteins, were expressed in bacteria, purified and then reconstituted in liposomes for enzyme kinetic assays. Quality of POR proteins was checked by cytochrome c, ferricyanide and tetrazolium dye reduction assay and measurements flavin content. We found that for the P284T variant of POR the cytochrome c reduction activity was reduced to 47% of the WT and MTT reduction was reduced to only 15% of the WT. No impact on ferricyanide reduction activity was observed, but a severe loss of CYP19A1 (aromatase) activity was observed (9% of WT). In the assays of drug metabolizing cytochrome P450 enzymes, the P284T variant of POR showed 26% activity for CYP2C9, 44% activity for CYP2C19, 23% activity for CYP3A4 and 44% activity in CYP3A5 assays compared to the WT POR. These results indicate a severe effect on several cytochrome P450 activities due to the P284T variation in POR which suggests a negative impact on both the steroid as well as drug metabolism in the individuals carrying this variation.","The calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is a ubiquitously expressed multifunctional G protein-coupled receptor. Several studies reported that the CaSR plays an anti-inflammatory and anti-tumorigenic role in the intestine, and that it is down-regulated during colorectal carcinogenesis. We hypothesized that intestine-specific positive allosteric CaSR modulators (type II calcimimetics) could be used for the treatment of intestinal pathologies. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the effect of pharmacological stimulation of CaSR on gene expression in vitro and on tumor growth in vivo.","The risk of developing systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is about 9 times higher among women compared to men. Our recent report, which used (SWRxNZB) F1 (SNF1) mouse model of spontaneous lupus, showed a potential link between immune response initiated in the gut mucosa at juvenile age (sex hormone independent) and SLE susceptibility. Here, this mouse model, we show that gut microbiota contributes to a pro-inflammatory immune response in the intestine and autoimmune progression, primarily in females, leading to an associated gender bias. We found that gut microbiota composition in male and female littermates are significantly different only at adult age and depletion of gut microbes causes suppression of autoimmune progression only in females. In agreement, microbiota depletion suppressed the pro-inflammatory cytokine response of gut mucosa in both juvenile and adult females. In male SNF1 mice, on the other hand, orchidectomy (castration) caused changes in the composition of gut microbiota and a modest acceleration of autoimmune progression. However, cecum microbiota transplantation studies failed to show superior protection of females from autoimmunity by androgen-influenced gut microbiota. Overall, our work shows that microbiota-dependent pro-inflammatory immune response in the gut mucosa of females initiated at juvenile ages and androgen-dependent protection of males contributes to gender differences in the intestinal immune phenotype and systemic autoimmune progression.","BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory bowel disorder with unknown etiology. Given its complex nature, in vivo studies to investigate its pathophysiology is vital. Animal models play an important role in molecular profiling necessary to pinpoint mechanisms that contribute to human disease. Thus, we aim to identify common conserved gene expression signatures and differentially regulated pathways between human UC and a mouse model hereof, which can be used to identify UC patients from healthy individuals and to suggest novel treatment targets and biomarker candidates.","Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients suffer poor outcomes in part due to therapeutic resistance. We conducted four genome-wide CRISPR activation (CRISPRact) and CRISPR knock out (CRISPRko) screens to identify novel resistance mechanisms to four cytotoxic chemotherapies (gemcitabine, 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin). ABCG2, a well-described efflux pump was the strongest mediator of resistance. We showed that overexpressing HDAC1 altered promoter occupancy and expression of genes involved in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Using the results of our CRISPR screens, we predicted drug sensitivity for patients and cell lines based on gene expression profiles. These predictions could be clinically useful for treatment selection.","PPARG role in regulation of osteocyte function is largely unknown. We report that PPARG is essential for sclerostin production, a recently approved target to treat osteoporosis. There is an excellent correlation in osteocytes between Sost/sclerostin and PPARG at the transcript and protein levels, and increased bone mass in mice with osteocyte-specific deletion of PPARG (\u03b3OTKO) correlated with increased WNT signaling and bone forming activity of endosteal osteoblasts and decreased marrow fat. The 8 kb sequence upstream of Sost gene transcription start site possesses multiple PPARG binding elements (PPREs) with at least two of them binding PPARG with dynamics reflecting its activation and the levels of Sost transcript and sclerostin protein expression. Older \u03b3OTKO female mice are largely protected from TZD-induced bone loss providing proof of concept that PPARG in osteocytes can be pharmacologically targeted. Our study opens the possibility to consider repurposing PPARG as a target for treatment of osteoporosis.","The aim of this study was to provide support for the performance, localization and expression of the epithelial calcium transporter channels, calbindin-D28k (Calb) and TRPV6, and of the morphology of the digestive and reproductive system of laying quails under heat stress, and with methionine supplementation. Therefore, the present study characterized the positivity (immunohistochemistry) and expression (real-time PCR) of calcium channels (Calb and TRPV6) in the kidneys, intestine and uterus of 504 laying quails that were submitted to different methionine supplementation (100, 110 and 120%) and temperatures (20, 24, 28 and 32\u00b0C). The animals under thermal stress had lower villus height, villus:crypt ratio, and goblet cell index in the duodenum and jejunum, fewer secondary and tertiary uterine folds, smaller hepatic steatosis, and increased number of distal convoluted renal tubules (CT) positive to Calb (protein), and increased positivity in proximal CTs. The deleterious effects of heat stress were minimized with methionine supplementation for the following variables: duodenal crypts, number of goblet cells of the jejunum, number of uterine folds, decreased Calb positivity in intestines and kidney, increased positivity of Calb in the uterus and increased TRPV6 gene expression in the kidney. Calcium transporters were altered due to less need for calcium absorption and reabsorption due to more calcium available with the supplementation, increasing egg production and quality. Methionine supplementation further increased intestinal villus absorption area and height, increased steatosis, decreased Calb positivity in the intestine and kidney, increased uterine positivity and Calb expression, and increased TRPV6 expression in the uterus under thermoneutrality. This is the first study that describes the gene and protein expression of calcium transporters in the intestine, kidney and uterus of laying quails, and concludes that the use of methionine supplementation is justifiable in order to partially reverse the deleterious effects of thermal stress on the production.","The chief and largely terminal element of normal blood clotting is considered to involve the polymerisation of the mainly \u03b1-helical fibrinogen to fibrin, with a binding mechanism involving \u2018knobs and holes\u2019 but with otherwise littl change in protein secondary structure. We recognise, however, that extremely unusual mutations, or mechanical stressing, can cause fibrinogen to adopt a conformation containing extensive \u03b2-sheets. Similarly, prions can change morphology from a largely alpha-helical to a largely \u03b2-sheet conformation, and the latter catalyses both the transition and the self-organising polymerisation of the \u03b2-sheet structures. Many other proteins can do this, where it is known as amyloidogenesis. When fibrin is formed in samples from patients harbouring different diseases it can have widely varying diameters and morphologies. We here develop the idea, and summarise the evidence, that in many cases the anomalous fibrin fibre formation seen in such diseases actually amounts to amyloidogenesis. In particular, fibrin can interact withthe amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) protein that is misfolded in Alzheimer's disease. Seeing these unusual fibrin morphologies as true amyloids explains a great deal about fibrin(ogen) biology that was previously opaque, and provides novel strategies for treating such coagulopathies. The literature on blood clotting can usefully both inform and be informed by that on prions and on the many other widely recognised (\u03b2)-amyloid proteins.","Hutchinson Gilford Progeria Syndrome is a premature aging disease caused by LMNA gene mutation and the production of a truncated lamin A protein \u201cprogerin\u201d that elicits cellular and organismal toxicity. Progerin accumulates in the vasculature, being especially toxic for vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). Patients\u2019 autopsies show that vessel stiffening, and aortic atherosclerosis is accompanied by VSMC depletion in the medial layer, altered extracellular matrix (ECM), and thickening of the adventitial layer. Mechanisms whereby progerin causes massive VSMC loss and vessel alterations remain poorly understood. Mature VSMC retain phenotypic plasticity and can switch to a synthetic/proliferative phenotype. Here we show that progerin expression in human and mouse VSMC causes a switch towards the synthetic/proliferative phenotype. This switch elicits some level of replication stress in normal cells, which is exacerbated in the presence of progerin, leading to telomere fragility, genomic instability, and ultimately VSMC death. Importantly, calcitriol prevents replication stress, telomere fragility, and genomic instability, reducing VSMC death. In addition, RNAseq analysis shows induction of a profibrotic and proinflammatory aging-associated secretory phenotype upon progerin expression in human primary VSMC. Our data suggest that phenotypic switch-induced replication stress might be an underlying cause of VSMC loss in progeria, which together with loss of contractile features and gain of profibrotic and proinflammatory signatures contribute to vascular stiffness in HGPS. Preventing the phenotypic switch-induced replication stress with compounds such as calcitriol might ameliorate CVD in HGPS patients.","Colorectal cancer (CRC) is characterised by heritable risk that is not well understood. Heritable, genetic variation at 11q23.1 is associated with increased colorectal cancer (CRC) risk, demonstrating eQTL effects on 3 cis- and 23 trans-eQTL targets. We sought to determine the relationship between 11q23.1 cis- and trans-eQTL target expression and test for potential cell-specificity. scRNAseq from 32,361 healthy colonic epithelial cells was aggregated and subject to weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). One module (blue) included 19 trans-eQTL targets and was correlated with C11orf53 expression only. Following unsupervised clustering of single cells, the expression of 19 trans-eQTL targets was greatest and most variable in cluster number 11, which transcriptionally resembled tuft cells. 14 trans-eQTL targets were found to demarcate this cluster, 11 of which were corroborated in a second dataset. Intra-cluster WGCNA and module preservation analysis then identified twelve 11q23.1 trans-eQTL targets to comprise a network that was specific to cluster 11. Finally, linear modelling and differential abundance testing showed 11q23.1 trans-eQTL target expression was predictive of cluster 11 abundance. Our findings suggest 11q23.1 trans-eQTL targets comprise a C11orf53-related network that is likely tuft cell-specific and reduced expression of these genes correlates with reduced tuft cell abundance in silico.","Establishing consensus around the transcriptional interface between coronavirus (CoV) infection and human cellular signaling pathways can catalyze the development of novel anti-CoV therapeutics. Here, we used publicly archived transcriptomic datasets to compute consensus regulatory signatures, or consensomes, that rank human genes based on their rates of differential expression in MERS-CoV (MERS), SARS-CoV-1 (SARS1) and SARS-CoV-2 (SARS2)-infected cells. Validating the CoV consensomes, we show that high confidence transcriptional targets (HCTs) of CoV infection intersect with HCTs of signaling pathway nodes with known roles in CoV infection. Among a series of novel use cases, we gather evidence for hypotheses that SARS2 infection efficiently represses E2F family target genes encoding key drivers of DNA replication and the cell cycle; that progesterone receptor signaling antagonizes SARS2-induced inflammatory signaling in the airway epithelium; and that SARS2 HCTs are enriched for genes involved in epithelial to mesenchymal transition. The CoV infection consensomes and HCT intersection analyses are freely accessible through the Signaling Pathways Project knowledgebase, and as Cytoscape-style networks in the Network Data Exchange repository.","Parathyroid hormone (PTH) regulates calcium metabolism and bone strength. Chronic kidney disease leads to secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHP) which increases morbidity and mortality. In experimental SHP, the increased PTH gene expression is due to enhanced PTH mRNA stability, mediated by changes in its interaction with stabilizing AUF1 and destabilizing KSRP. Pin1 isomerizes target proteins and leads to KSRP dephosphorylation. In SHP, Pin1 isomerase activity is decreased and phosphorylated KSRP fails to bind PTH mRNA, resulting in high PTH mRNA stability and levels. However, the up- and down-stream mechanisms by which kidney failure stimulates the parathyroid remain elusive. We now reveal a pathway where kidney failure induces parathyroid Pin1 phosphorylation, linking Pin1, KSRP and PTH mRNA stability as key players for the high PTH expression in SHP. We identified by mass-spectrometry, changes in rat parathyroid proteome and phosphoproteome profiles induced by impaired renal function, including KSRP phosphorylation at Pin1 target sites. Furthermore, both acute and chronic kidney failure led to parathyroid-specific Pin1 Ser16 and Ser71 phosphorylation, which disrupts Pin1 activity. Accordingly, pharmacologic Pin1 inhibition, that mimics the decreased Pin1 activity in SHP, increased PTH expression ex-vivo in parathyroid organ cultures and in transfected cells, through the PTH mRNA protein-interacting element and KSRP phosphorylation at potential Pin1-binding motifs. Therefore, kidney failure leads to loss of parathyroid Pin1 activity by inducing Pin1 phosphorylation. This predisposes parathyroids to increase PTH production through impaired PTH mRNA decay that is dependent on KSRP phosphorylation. Pin1 and KSRP phosphorylation and the Pin1-KSRP-PTH mRNA axis thus drive SHP.","Early diabetes research is hampered by limited availability, variable quality and instability of human pancreatic islets in culture. Little is known about the human \u03b2 cell secretome, and recent studies question translatability of rodent \u03b2 cell secretory profiles. Here, we verify representativeness of EndoC-\u03b2H1, one of the most widely used human \u03b2 cell lines, as a translational human \u03b2 cell model based on omics and characterize the EndoC-\u03b2H1 secretome. We profiled EndoC-\u03b2H1 cells using RNA-seq, Data Independent Acquisition (DIA) and Tandem Mass Tag proteomics of cell lysate. Omics profiles of EndoC-\u03b2H1 cells were compared to human \u03b2 cells and insulinomas. Secretome composition was assessed by DIA proteomics. Agreement between EndoC-\u03b2H1 cells and primary adult human \u03b2 cells was ~90% for global omics profiles as well as for \u03b2 cell markers, transcription factors and enzymes. Discrepancies in expression were due to elevated proliferation rate of EndoC-\u03b2H1 cells compared to adult \u03b2 cells. Consistently, similarity was slightly higher with benign non-metastatic insulinomas. EndoC-\u03b2H1 secreted 671 proteins in untreated baseline state and 3,278 proteins when stressed with non-targeting control siRNA, including known \u03b2 cell hormones INS, IAPP, and IGF2. Further, EndoC-\u03b2H1 secreted proteins known to generate bioactive peptides such as granins and enzymes required for production of bioactive peptides. Unexpectedly, exosomes appeared to be a major mode of secretion in EndoC-\u03b2H1 cells. We believe that secretion of exosomes and bioactive peptides warrant further investigation with specialized proteomics workflows in future studies.","Dynamic and temporally specific gene regulatory changes may underlie unexplained genetic associations with complex disease. During a dynamic process such as cellular differentiation, the overall cell type composition of a tissue (or an in vitro culture) and the gene regulatory profile of each cell can both experience significant changes over time. To identify these dynamic effects in high resolution, we collected single-cell RNA-sequencing data over a differentiation time course from induced pluripotent stem cells to cardiomyocytes, sampled at 7 unique time points in 19 human cell lines. We employed a flexible approach to map dynamic eQTLs whose effects vary significantly over the course of bifurcating differentiation trajectories, including many whose effects are specific to one of these two lineages. Our study design allowed us to distinguish true dynamic eQTLs affecting a specific cell lineage from expression changes driven by potentially non-genetic differences between cell lines such as cell composition. Additionally, we used the cell type profiles learned from single-cell data to deconvolve and re-analyze data from matched bulk RNA-seq samples. Using this approach, we were able to identify a large number of novel dynamic eQTLs in single cell data while also attributing dynamic effects in bulk to a particular lineage. Overall, we found that using single cell data to uncover dynamic eQTLs can provide new insight into the gene regulatory changes that occur among heterogeneous cell types during cardiomyocyte differentiation.","Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapies demonstrate the clinical potential of lymphocytes engineered with synthetic properties. However, CAR-T cells are ineffective in most solid tumors, partly due to inadequate activation of the infused lymphocytes at the site of malignancy. To selectively enhance anti-tumor efficacy without exacerbating off-target toxicities, CAR-T cells can be engineered to preferentially deliver immunostimulatory payloads in tumors. Here, we report a novel antigen-inducible promoter and single-vector sense-and-respond circuit for conditional payload expression in primary human T cells. In therapeutic T cell models, the novel NR4A-based promoter induced higher transgene expression than the conventional NFAT-based promoter under weakly immunogenic conditions, where payload expression is most needed. Minimal activity was detected from the inducible promoters in the absence of antigen and after withdrawal of stimulation. As a functional proof-of-concept, we used the NR4A-based promoter to express cytokines in an anti-mesothelin CAR-T model with suboptimal stimulation, and observed improved proliferation compared to T cells engineered with the conventional NFAT promoter or CAR alone. Our single-vector circuit achieves CAR-directed payload expression under weakly immunogenic conditions and could enable the next generation of cell therapies with enhanced anti-tumor efficacy.","Human epidermal Langerhans cells (LCs) can coordinate both immunogenic and tolerogenic immune responses, creating an attractive opportunity for immunomodulation strategies. To investigate transcriptional determinants of human primary LC tolerance we applied single cells RNA-sequencing combined with transcriptional network modelling and functional analysis. Unsupervised clustering of single cell transcriptomes revealed that steady-state LCs exist in immature and immunocompetent states, and become fully immunocompetent on migration. Interestingly, LC migration, which has been shown to result in upregulation of the transcription factor IRF4, led in parallel to increased expression of a tolerogenic gene module including IDO1, LGALS1, LAMTOR1 and IL10RA, which translated to efficient induction of regulatory T cells in co-culture assays by immunocompetent LCs. Using protein expression analysis and perturbation with inhibitors, we confirmed the role of IDO1 as a mediator of LC tolerogenic responses induced during LC migration. Computational analysis of regulons and Partial Information Decomposition analyses identified IRF4 as a key driver for LC tolerogenic programmes. The predicted IRF4-regulated genes were confirmed by analysis of CRISPR-Cas9 edited LCs. These findings suggest that efficient priming of tolerogenic responses by LCs requires upregulation of a migration-coupled maturation program which is superimposed with a tolerance-inducing genomic module.","Precision medicine is an emerging paradigm that requires realistic, mechanistic models capturing the complexity of the human body. We present two comprehensive molecular to physiological-level, gender-specific whole-body metabolism (WBM) reconstructions, named Harvey, in recognition of William Harvey, and Harvetta. These validated, knowledge-based WBM reconstructions capture the metabolism of 20 organs, six sex organs, six blood cells, the gastrointestinal lumen, systemic blood circulation, and the blood-brain barrier. They represent 99% of the human body weight, when excluding the weight of the skeleton. Harvey and Harvetta can be parameterized based on physiological, dietary, and omics data. They correctly predict inter-organ metabolic cycles, basal metabolic rates, and energy use. We demonstrate the integration of microbiome data thereby allowing the assessment of individual-specific, organ-level modulation of host metabolism by the gut microbiota. The WBM reconstructions and the individual organ reconstructions are available under http://vmh.life. Harvey and Harvetta represent a pivotal step towards virtual physiological humans.","ZMIZ1 is a transcriptional coactivator that is related to members of the protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS) family. ZMIZ1 regulates the activity of various transcription factors including the androgen receptor, p53, and Smad3. ZMIZ1 also interacts with Notch1 and selectively regulates Notch1 target genes relevant for T cell development and leukemogenesis in mammals. Human ZMIZ1 is additionally characterized as a latitude-dependent autoimmune disease (LDAD) risk gene, as it is responsive to vitamin D and has been associated with at least eleven blood cell traits.","Immunization with radiation-attenuated sporozoites (RAS) can confer sterilizing protection against malaria, although the mechanisms behind this protection are incompletely understood. We performed a systems biology analysis of samples from the Immunization by Mosquito with Radiation Attenuated Sporozoites IMRAS) trial, which comprised P. falciparum RAS-immunized (PfRAS), malaria-naive participants whose protection from malaria infection was subsequently assessed by controlled human malaria infection (CHMI). Blood samples collected after initial PfRAS immunization were analyzed to compare immune responses between protected and non-protected volunteers leveraging integrative analysis of whole blood RNA-seq, high parameter flow cytometry, and single cell CITEseq of PBMCs. This analysis revealed differences in early innate immune responses indicating divergent paths associated with protection. In particular, elevated levels of inflammatory responses early after the initial immunization were detrimental for the development of protective adaptive immunity. Specifically, non-classical monocytes and early type I interferon responses induced within 1 day of PfRAS vaccination correlated with impaired immunity. Non-protected individuals also showed an increase in Th2 polarized T cell responses whereas we observed a trend towards increased Th1 and T-bet+ CD8 T cell responses in protected individuals. Temporal differences in genes associated with natural killer cells suggest an important role in immune regulation by these cells. These findings give insight into the immune responses that confer protection against malaria and may guide further malaria vaccine development.","Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is known to be protective against oxidative stress-mediated skin dysfunction. Here we explore the potential therapeutic activities of RM191A, a novel SOD mimetic, on skin. RM191A is a water soluble, dimeric copper (Cu2+-Cu3+)-centred polyglycine coordination complex. It displays 10-fold higher superoxide quenching activity compared to SOD as well as significant anti-inflammatory activity through beneficial modulation of several significant inflammatory pathways in cells.","Progressive destruction of pancreatic islet \u03b2-cells by immune cells is a primary feature of type 1 diabetes (T1D) and therapies that can restore the functional \u03b2-cell mass are needed to alleviate disease progression. Here, we report the use of mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) for the production and delivery of Gastrin, a peptide-hormone which is produced by intestinal cells and fetal islets and can increase \u03b2-Cell mass, to promote protection from T1D. A single injection of syngeneic MSCs that were engineered to express Gastrin (Gastrin-MSCs) caused a significant delay in hyperglycemia in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice compared to engineered control-MSCs. Similar treatment of early-hyperglycemic mice caused the restoration of euglycemia for a considerable duration, and these therapeutic effects were associated with protection of, and/or higher frequencies of, insulin producing islets and less severe insulitis. While the overall immune cell phenotype was not affected profoundly upon treatment using Gastrin-MSCs or upon in vitro culture, pancreatic lymph node cells from Gastrin-MSC treated mice, upon ex vivo challenge with self-antigen, showed a Th2 and Th17 bias, and diminished the diabetogenic property in NOD-Rag1 deficient mice suggesting a disease protective immune modulation under Gastrin-MSC treatment associated protection from hyperglycemia. Overall, this study shows the potential of production and delivery of Gastrin in vivo, by MSCs, in protecting insulin producing \u03b2-cells and ameliorating the disease progression in T1D.","Rett syndrome (RTT) is a rare disease but still one of the most abundant causes for intellectual disability in females. Typical symptoms are onset at month 6-18 after normal pre-and postnatal development, loss of acquired skills and severe intellectual disability. The type and severity of symptoms are individually highly different. A single mutation in one gene, coding for methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2), is responsible for the disease. The most important action of MECP2 is regulating epigenetic imprinting and chromatin condensation, but MECP2 influences many different biological pathways on multiple levels. In this review the known changes in metabolite levels, gene expression and biological pathways in RTT are summarized. It is discussed how they are leading to some characteristic RTT phenotypes and identifies the gaps of knowledge, namely which phenotypes have currently no mechanistic explanation leading back to MECP2 related pathways. As a result of this review the visualization of the biologic pathways showing MECP2 up-and downstream regulation was developed and published on WikiPathways.","Purpose To investigate if accounting for a cup-to-disc ratio (CDR) genetic risk score (GRS) modified the association between large CDR and cognitive function among women.","Recent evidence suggests that several cattle breeds may be more resistant to infection with the zoonotic pathogen Mycobacterium bovis than others. Our data presented here suggests that the response to mycobacterial antigens varies in macrophages generated from Brown Swiss (BS) and Holstein Frisian (HF) cattle, two breeds belonging to the Bos taurus family. Whole genome sequencing of the Brown Swiss genome identified several potential candidate genes, in particular Toll-like Receptor-2 (TLR2) a pattern recognition receptor (PRR) that has previously been described to be involved in mycobacterial recognition. Further investigation revealed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in TLR2 that were identified between DNA isolated from cells of BS and HF cows. Interestingly, one specific SNP, H326Q, showed a different genotype frequency in two cattle subspecies, Bos taurus and Bos indicus. Cloning of the TLR2 gene and subsequent gene-reporter and chemokine assays revealed that this SNP, present in BS and Bos indicus breeds, resulted in a significantly higher response to mycobacterial antigens as well as tri-acylated lipopeptide ligands in general. Comparing wild-type and H326Q containing TLR2 responses, wild-type bovine TLR2 response showed clear, diminished mycobacterial antigen responses compared to human TLR2, however bovine TLR2 responses containing H326Q were found to be partially recovered compared to human TLR2. The creation of human:bovine TLR2 chimeras increased the response to mycobacterial antigens compared to the full-length bovine TLR2, but significantly reduced the response compared to the full-length human TLR2. Thus, our data, not only present evidence that TLR2 is a major PRR in the mammalian species-specific response to mycobacterial antigens, but furthermore, that there are clear differences between the response seen in different cattle breeds, which may contribute to their enhanced or reduced susceptibility to mycobacterial infection.","There is a need to develop identification tests for Metabolism Disrupting Chemicals (MDCs) with diabetogenic activity. Here we used the human EndoC-\u03b2H1 \u03b2-cell line, the rat \u03b2-cell line INS-1E and dispersed mouse islet cells to assess the effects of endocrine disruptors on cell viability and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). We tested six chemicals at concentrations within human exposure (from 0.1 pM to 1 \u03bcM). Bisphenol-A (BPA) and tributyltin (TBT) were used as controls while four other chemicals, namely perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), triphenylphosphate (TPP), triclosan (TCS) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), were used as \u201cunknowns\u201d. Regarding cell viability, BPA and TBT increased cell death as previously observed. Their mode of action involved the activation of estrogen receptors and PPAR\u03b3, respectively. ROS production was a consistent key event in BPA- and TBT-treated cells. None of the other MDCs tested modified viability or ROS production. Concerning GSIS, TBT increased insulin secretion while BPA produced no effects. PFOA decreased GSIS, suggesting that this chemical could be a \u201cnew\u201d diabetogenic agent. Our results indicate that the EndoC-\u03b2H1 cell line is a suitable human \u03b2-cell model for testing diabetogenic MDCs. Optimization of the test methods proposed here could be incorporated into tier protocols for the identification of MDCs.","Pathological pathways involved in the development of diabetic complications are still unclear. Several studies suggested a pathogenic role of C-peptide deficiency in vascular and neuropathic complications. However, to date, the role of C-peptide on diabetes-related bone loss has not been investigated. The objective of this study was to test the effects of a 6-week regimen of rat C-peptide infusion on bone by combining micro-CT imaging with histological testing.","The steroid hormone, Glucocorticoid (GC) is a well-known immunosuppressant that controls T cell-mediated adaptive immune response. In this work, we have developed a minimal kinetic network model of T-cell regulation connecting relevant experimental and clinical studies to quantitatively understand the long-term effects of GC on pro-inflammatory T-cell (Tpro) and anti-inflammatory T-cell (Tanti) dynamics. Due to the antagonistic relation between these two types of T-cells, their long-term steady-state population ratio helps us to characterize three classified immune-regulations: (i) weak ([Tpro]&gt;[Tanti]); (ii) strong ([Tpro]&lt;[Tanti]), and (iii) moderate ([Tpro] \u223c [Tanti]); holding the characteristic bistability). In addition to the differences in their long-term steady-state outcome, each immune-regulation shows distinct dynamical phases. In the pre-steady, a characteristic intermediate stationary phase is observed to develop only in the moderate regulation regime. In the medicinal field, the resting time in this stationary phase is distinguished as a clinical latent period. GC dose-dependent steady-state analysis shows an optimal level of GC to drive a phase-transition from the weak/auto-immune prone to the moderate regulation regime. Subsequently, the pre-steady state clinical latent period tends to diverge near that optimal GC level where [Tpro]: [Tanti] is highly balanced. The GC-optimized elongated stationary phase explains the rationale behind the requirement of long-term immune diagnostics, especially when long-term GC-based chemotherapeutics and other immunosuppressive drugs are administrated. Moreover, our study reveals GC sensitivity of clinical latent period which might serve as an early warning signal in the diagnosis of different immune phases and determining immune phase-wise steroid treatment.","In this study, Walker 256 cells were implanted into rat tibiae. Urine samples were then collected on days 3, 5, 7, and 13 and were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). With label-free quantification, 25 proteins were found to change significantly in the urine of the tumor group mice compared with the proteins in the urine of the control group mice; this was even the case when there were no significant lesions identified in the Computed Tomography(CT) examination. Among these differentially proteins, 7 were reported to be associated with tumor bone metastasis. GO analysis shows that the differential proteins on day 3 were involved in several responses, including the acute phase response, the adaptive immune response and the innate immune response. The differentially proteins on day 7 were involved in the mineral absorption pathway. The differentially proteins on day 13 were involved in vitamin D binding and calcium ion binding. These processes may be associated with bone metastasis. Our results demonstrate that urine could sensitively reflect the changes in the early stage of implanted bone cancer; this provides valuable clues for future studies of urine biomarkers for tumor bone metastasis.","Long bones from mammals host blood cell formation and contain multiple cell types, including adipocytes. Physiological functions of bone marrow adipocytes are poorly documented. Herein, we used adipocyte-deficient PPAR\u03b3-whole body null mice to investigate the consequence of total adipocyte deficiency on bone homeostasis in mice. We first highlight the dual bone phenotype of PPAR\u03b3 null mice: on the one hand the increase bone formation and subsequent trabecularization extending in the long bone diaphysis, due to the well-known impact of PPAR\u03b3 deficiency on osteoblasts formation and activity; on the other hand, an increased osteoclastogenesis in the cortical bone. We then further explore the cause of this unexpected increased osteoclastogenesis using two independent models of lipoatrophy, which recapitulated this phenotype. This demonstrates that hyperosteoclastogenesis is not intrinsically linked to PPAR\u03b3 deficiency, but is a consequence of the total lipodystrophy. We further showed that adiponectin, a cytokine produced by adipocytes and mesenchymal stromal cells is a potent inhibitor of osteoclastogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, pharmacological activation of adiponectin receptors by the synthetic agonist AdipoRon inhibits mature osteoclast activity both in mouse and human cells by blocking podosome formation through AMPK activation. Finally, we demonstrated that AdipoRon treatment blocks bone erosion in vivo in a murine model of inflammatory bone loss, providing potential new approaches to treat osteoporosis.","The circadian clock system regulates multiple metabolic processes, including bone metabolism. Previous studies have demonstrated that both central and peripheral circadian signaling regulate skeletal growth and homeostasis. Disruption in central circadian rhythms has been associated with a decline in bone mineral density and the global and osteoblast-specific disruption of clock genes in bone tissue leads to lower bone mass. Gut physiology is highly sensitive to circadian disruption. Since the gut is also known to affect bone remodeling, we sought to test the hypothesis that circadian signaling disruption in colon epithelial cells affects bone. We therefore assessed structural, functional, and cellular properties of bone in 8 week old Ts4-Cre and Ts4-Cre;Bmal1fl/fl (cBmalKO) mice, where the clock gene Bmal1 is deleted in colon epithelial cells. Axial and appendicular trabecular bone volume was significantly lower in cBmalKO compared to Ts4-Cre 8-week old mice in a sex-dependent fashion, with male but not female mice showing the phenotype. Similarly, the whole bone mechanical properties were deteriorated in cBmalKO male mice. The tissue level mechanisms involved suppressed bone formation with normal resorption, as evidenced by serum markers and dynamic histomorphometry. Our studies demonstrate that colon epithelial cell-specific deletion of Bmal1 leads to trabecular and cortical bone loss in male mice.","The retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonist bexarotene has recently been shown to promote remyelination in individuals with multiple sclerosis. Murine studies demonstrated that RXR agonists can have anti-inflammatory effects by enhancing the ability of all-trans-retinoic acid (\u03b1tRA), the primary active metabolite of vitamin A, to promote T regulatory cell (Treg) induction and reduce Th17 differentiation in vitro, following stimulation of na\u00efve CD4 cells in the presence of TGF-\u03b2.","Antigen-specific therapies hold promise for treating autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis while avoiding the deleterious side effects of systemic immune suppression. In this study, an antigen-specific dual-sized microparticle (dMP) immunotherapy reversed hind limb paralysis when administered in mice with advanced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Treatment reduced central nervous system (CNS) immune cell infiltration, demyelination and inflammatory cytokine levels. Mechanistic insights using single-cell RNA sequencing showed that treatment impacted the MHC II antigen presentation pathway in dendritic cells, macrophages, B cells and microglia, not only in the draining lymph nodes, but strikingly also in the spinal cord. CD74 and cathepsin S were among the common genes downregulated in most antigen presenting cell (APC) clusters, with B cells also having numerous MHC II genes reduced. Efficacy of the treatment diminished when B cells were absent, suggesting their impact in this therapy, in concert with other immune populations. Activation and inflammation were reduced in both APCs and T cells. This promising antigen-specific therapeutic approach advantageously engaged essential components of both innate and adaptive autoimmune responses, and capably reversed paralysis in advanced EAE without the use of broad immunosuppressant.","Current clinical methods used to evaluate bone quality and quantity are insufficient for clinical evaluation of microstructural bone health, which is relevant in early diagnosis of bone disease. High resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) has recently emerged as a potential clinical tool for quantifying volumetric bone mineral density and microarchitecture. When combined with a longitudinal imaging protocol and finite element analysis, HR-pQCT can be used to assess bone remodeling and mechanoregulation at the tissue level. Herein, 25 patients with a contralateral distal radius fracture were imaged with HR-pQCT at baseline and 9-12 months follow-up: 16 patients were prescribed Calcium and/or Vitamin D supplement with indication of diminishing (n=9) or poor (n=7) bone quantity and 9 were not. To evaluate the sensitivity of this imaging protocol to microstructural changes, HR-pQCT images were registered for quantification of bone remodeling and image-based micro-finite element (micro-FE) analysis was then used to predict local bone strains and derive rules for bone mechanoregulation. Remodeling was predicted by both trabecular and cortical thickness and bone mineral density (R2&gt;0.8), whereas mechanoregulation was affected by dominance of the arm and group classification (p&lt;0.05). Overall, longitudinal HR-pQCT proved value in long-term patient evaluation and management of bone health.","Although there is strong evidence that certain activities can increase bone density and structure in some individuals, it is unclear what specific mechanical factors govern the response. This is important because understanding the effect of mechanical signals on bone could contribute to more effective osteoporosis prevention methods and efficient clinical trial design. The degree to which strain rate and magnitude govern bone adaptation in humans has never been prospectively tested. Here, we studied the effects of a voluntary upper extremity compressive loading task in healthy adult women during a twelve month prospective period. One hundred and two women age 21-40 participated in one of two experiments. (1): low (n=21) and high (n=24) strain magnitude. (2): low (n=21) and high (n=20) strain rate. Control: (n=16): no intervention. Strains were assigned using subject-specific finite element models. Load cycles were recorded digitally. The primary outcome was change in ultradistal integral bone mineral content (iBMC), assessed with QCT. Interim timepoints and secondary outcomes were assessed with high resolution pQCT (HRpQCT). Sixty-six subjects completed the intervention, and interim data were analyzed for 77 subjects. Both the low and high strain rate groups had significant 12-month increases to ultradistal iBMC (change in control: -1.3\u00b12.7%, low strain rate: 2.7\u00b12.1%, high strain rate: 3.4\u00b12.2%), total iBMC, and other measures. \u201cLoading dose\u201d was positively related to 12-month change in ultradistal iBMC, and interim changes to total BMD, cortical thickness and inner trabecular BMD. Subjects who gained the most bone completed, on average, 130 loading bouts of (mean strain) 550 \u03bc\u03b5 at 1805 \u03bc\u03b5/s. Those with the greatest gains had the highest loading dose. We conclude that signals related to strain magnitude, rate, and number of loading bouts contribute to bone adaptation in healthy adult women, but only explain a small amount of variance in bone changes.","The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is creating new, economical, qualitative reference materials and data for proteomics comparisons, benchmarking and harmonization. Here we describe a large dataset from shotgun proteomic analysis of RM 8461 Human Liver for Proteomics, a reference material being developed. Consensus identifications using multiple search engines and sample preparations demonstrate a homogeneous and fit-for-purpose material that can be incorporated into automated or manual sample preparation workflows, with the resulting data used to directly assess complete sample-to-data workflows and provide harmonization and benchmarking between laboratories and techniques. Data are available via PRIDE with identifier PXD013608.","The total number of acquired melanocytic nevi on the skin is strongly correlated with melanoma risk. Here we report a meta-analysis of 11 nevus GWAS from Australia, Netherlands, United Kingdom, and United States, comprising a total of 52,506 phenotyped individuals. We confirm known loci including MTAP, PLA2G6, and IRF4, and detect novel SNPs at a genome-wide level of significance in KITLG, DOCK8, and a broad region of 9q32. In a bivariate analysis combining the nevus results with those from a recent melanoma GWAS meta-analysis (12,874 cases, 23,203 controls), SNPs near GPRC5A, CYP1B1, PPARGC1B, HDAC4, FAM208B and SYNE2 reached global significance, and other loci, including MIR146A and OBFC1, reached a suggestive level of significance. Overall, we conclude that most nevus genes affect melanoma risk (KITLG an exception), while many melanoma risk loci do not alter nevus count. For example, variants in TERC and OBFC1 affect both traits, but other telomere length maintenance genes seem to affect melanoma risk only. Our findings implicate multiple pathways in nevogenesis via genes we can show to be expressed under control of the MITF melanocytic cell lineage regulator.","Dendritic cells (DCs) play an important role in anti-tumor immunity by inducing T cell differentiation. Herein, we found that the mechanical sensor Piezo1 expressed by DCs integrates innate inflammatory stimuli and stiffness signals and directs the reciprocal differentiation of TH1 and regulatory T (Treg) cells in cancer. Genetic deletion of Piezo1 in DCs inhibited the generation of TH1 cells while driving the development of Treg cells in promoting cancer growth. Mechanistically, Piezo1-deficient DCs regulated the secretion of the polarizing cytokines TGF\u03b21 and IL-12, leading to increased TGF\u03b2R2-p-Smad3 activity and decreased IL-12R\u03b22-p-STAT4 activity while inducing the reciprocal differentiation of Treg and TH1 cells. In addition, Piezo1 integrated the SIRT1-hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF1\u03b1)-dependent metabolic pathway and calcium-calcineurin-NFAT signaling pathway to orchestrate reciprocal TH1 and Treg lineage commitment through DC-derived IL-12 and TGF\u03b21. Our studies provide critical insight for understanding the role of the DC-based mechanical regulation of immunopathology in directing T cell lineage commitment in tumor microenvironments.","Fetal sex-specific differences in placental morphology and physiology have been associated with sexually dimorphic health outcomes. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these sex differences are not well understood. We performed whole genome bisulfite sequencing in 133 placenta samples and discovered a significant difference in DNA methylation (DNAm) at the ZNF300 gene locus between male and female offspring and replicated this result in 6 independent datasets. Additionally, the sex-specific pattern appears to be placenta-specific, is robust to a wide range of gestational ages and adverse health outcomes and is present in sorted placenta villous cytotrophoblast cells. Integration of DNAm, genetic, and placental morphology data from the same individuals revealed ZNF300 methylation is also associated with placenta area, perimeter, and max diameter, genetic variants on chromosomes 5 and X, and may mediate the effects of genetic variation on placental area.","Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a group of metabolic diseases, which is of urgent need to develop new therapeutic DM oral drugs with less side effects and sound therapeutic efficacy. In this study, a Beta cell expansion factor A (BefA) production strain of Escherichia Coli BL21-pet 28C-BefA was constructed, and the anti-diabetes effect of BefA was evaluated using type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) mice models. The T1DM mice results indicated that BefA significantly reduced the blood glucose level, exerted protective function of islet \u03b2 cell morphology, down-regulated the TLR-4, p-NF\u03baB/NF\u03baB, Bax/Bcl-2 expressions and the secretion level of IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, increased the expression of PDX-1 protein and insulin secretion in a concentration-dependent manner, and restored the disturbed microbial diversity to normal level. Similar with the T1DM mice, BefA obviously increased islet \u03b2 cells, reduced inflammatory reaction and apoptosis in T2DM mice, and also improved liver lipid metabolism by down-regulating the expression of CEBP-\u03b1, ACC, Fasn and inhibiting the synthesis of triglyceride and induce Cpt-1, Hmgcs2, Ppar\u03b1 in a concentration-dependent manner. In the present study, we verified therapeutic effect and potential mechanisms of BefA in mammal for the first time, providing basic data for its clinical application.","Two functional enhancers of FOXP2, a gene important for language development and evolution, exhibit several human-specific changes compared to extinct hominins that are located within the binding site for different transcription factors. Specifically, Neanderthals and Denisovans bear the ancestral allele in one position within the binding site for SMARCC1, involved in brain development and vitamin D metabolism. This change might have resulted in a different pattern of FOXP2 expression in our species compared to extinct hominins.","Chronic wounds impose a significant healthcare burden to a broad patient population. Cell based therapies, while having shown benefits for the treatment of chronic wounds, have not achieved widespread adoption into clinical practice. Here, we developed a novel CRISPR/Cas9 approach to precisely edit dendritic cells (DCs) to enhance their therapeutic potential for healing chronic wounds. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of tolerogenic DCs, we discover N-myc downregulated gene 2 (Ndrg2), which marks a specific population of DC progenitors, as a promising target for CRISPR knockout (KO). Ndrg2-KO alters the transcriptomic profile of DCs and preserves an immature cell state with a strong, pro-angiogenic and regenerative capacity. We then incorporated our CRISPR-based cell engineering within a hydrogel technology for in vivo cell delivery and developed a highly effective translational approach for DC based immunotherapy that accelerated healing of full-thickness wounds in both non-diabetic and diabetic mouse models. These findings could open the door to future clinical trials using safe gene editing in DCs for treating various types of chronic wounds.","Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are considered to have limited clonal diversity. In contrast, recent studies suggest the presence of functionally distinct subsets. We investigated this model through single-cell analysis of the MAIT cell TCR repertoire and transcriptional profile in human blood and liver. Further, we developed functional RNA-sequencing (fRNA-seq), an approach to integrate cellular function and TCR clonotype at a single-cell level following differential stimulation. MAIT cells showed surprising clonal diversity, with TCR repertoires shared across tissues but unique to individuals. Functional diversity within resting MAIT cells was low and largely related to tissue site. MAIT cells displayed distinct transcriptional responses to in vitro TCR and cytokine stimulation, with cells positioned along gradients of activation. Clonal origin influenced both resting and activated transcriptional profiles. Overall, MAIT cells exhibit diverse donor-specific TCR repertoires which, along with tissue and activation context, influence their phenotype and function.","Background Parathyroid Ca2+-sensing receptor (CaSR) activation inhibits parathyroid hormone (PTH) release, while activation of CaSRs in kidneys and intestine attenuates local transepithelial Ca2+ transport. In patients with autosomal dominant hypocalcemia 1 (ADH1) due to activating CASR mutations, treatment of symptomatic hypocalcemia can be complicated by treatment-induced hypercalciuria, resulting in nephrocalcinosis and renal insufficiency. Although CaSRs throughout the body are activated by increased extracellular Ca2+ concentrations, it is not understood why some ADH1 patients have reduced PTH, but not hypercalciuria at presentation, despite CaSR expression in both kidney and parathyroid.","Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is an arterivirus which causes significant economic losses to the swine industry worldwide. Here, we use ribosome profiling (RiboSeq) and parallel RNA sequencing (RNASeq) to characterise the transcriptome and translatome of both species of PRRSV and analyse the host response to infection. We quantified viral gene expression over a timecourse of infection, and calculated the efficiency of programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) at both sites on the viral genome. At the nsp2 frameshift site (a rare example of protein-stimulated frameshifting), \u22122 PRF efficiency increases over time, likely facilitated by accumulation of the PRF- stimulatory viral protein (nsp1\u03b2) during infection. This marks arteriviruses as the second example of temporally regulated PRF. Surprisingly, we also found PRF efficiency at the canonical ORF1ab frameshift site increases over time, in apparent contradiction of the common assumption that RNA structure-directed frameshift sites operate at a fixed efficiency. This has potential implications for the numerous other viruses with canonical PRF sites. Furthermore, we discovered several highly translated additional viral ORFs, the translation of which may be facilitated by multiple novel viral transcripts. For example, we found a 125-codon ORF overlapping nsp12, which is expressed as highly as nsp12 itself at late stages of replication, and is likely translated from novel subgenomic (sg) RNA transcripts that overlap the 3\u2032 end of ORF1b. Similar transcripts were discovered for both PRRSV-1 and PRRSV- 2, suggesting a potential conserved mechanism for temporal regulation of expression of the 3\u2032-proximal region of ORF1b. In addition, we identified a highly translated, short upstream ORF (uORF) in the 5\u2032 UTR, the presence of which is highly conserved amongst PRRSV-2 isolates. This is the first application of RiboSeq to arterivirus-infected cells, and reveals new features which add to the complexity of gene expression programmes in this important family of nidoviruses.","SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread and evolve worldwide, despite intense efforts to develop multiple vaccines and therapeutic options against COVID-19. Moreover, the precise role of SARS-CoV-2 in the pathophysiology of the nasopharyngeal tract (NT) is still unfathomable. Therefore, we used the machine learning methods to analyze 22 RNA-seq datasets from COVID-19 patients (n=8), recovered individuals (n=7), and healthy individuals (n=7) to find disease-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs). In comparison to healthy controls, we found 1960 and 153 DEG signatures in COVID-19 patients and recovered individuals, respectively. We compared dysregulated DEGs to detect critical pathways and gene ontology (GO) connected to COVID-19 comorbidities. In COVID-19 patients, the DEG\u2013 miRNA and DEG\u2013transcription factors (TFs) interactions network analysis revealed that E2F1, MAX, EGR1, YY1, and SRF were the most highly expressed TFs, whereas hsa-miR-19b, hsa-miR-495, hsa-miR-340, hsa-miR-101, and hsa-miR-19a were the overexpressed miRNAs. Three chemical agents (Valproic Acid, Alfatoxin B1, and Cyclosporine) were abundant in COVID-19 patients and recovered individuals. Mental retardation, mental deficit, intellectual disability, muscle hypotonia, micrognathism, and cleft palate were the significant diseases associated with COVID-19 by sharing DEGs. Finally, we detected DEGs impacted by SARS-CoV-2 infection and mediated by TFs and miRNA expression, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 infection may contribute to various comorbidities. These pathogenetic findings can provide some crucial insights into the complex interplay between COVID-19 and the recovery stage and support its importance in the therapeutic development strategy to combat against COVID-19 pandemic.","Objective Dopaminergic neurotransmission is known to be a potential modulator of risky behaviors including substance abuse, promiscuity, and gambling. Furthermore, observational studies have shown associations between risky behaviors and Parkinson\u2019s disease; however, the causal nature of these associations remains unclear. Thus, in this study, we examine causal associations between risky behavior phenotypes on Parkinson\u2019s disease using a Mendelian randomization approach.","Bile salt hydrolase (BSH) enzymes are widely expressed by human gut bacteria and catalyze the gateway reaction leading to secondary bile acid formation. Bile acids regulate key metabolic and immune processes by binding to host receptors. There is an unmet need for a potent tool to inhibit BSHs across all gut bacteria in order to study the effects of bile acids on host physiology. Here, we report the development of a covalent pan-inhibitor of gut bacterial BSH. From a rationally designed candidate library, we identified a lead compound bearing an alpha-fluoromethyl ketone warhead that modifies BSH at the catalytic cysteine residue. Strikingly, this inhibitor abolished BSH activity in conventional mouse feces. Mice gavaged with a single dose of this compound displayed decreased BSH activity and decreased deconjugated bile acid levels in feces. Our studies demonstrate the potential of a covalent BSH inhibitor to modulate bile acid composition in vivo.","Background Health traits are of significant economic importance to the dairy industry due to their effects on milk production and associated treatment costs. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide a means to identify associated genomic variants and thus reveal insights into the genetic architecture of complex traits and diseases. The objective of this study is to investigate the genetic basis of seven health traits in dairy cattle and to identify potential candidate genes associated with cattle health using GWAS, fine mapping, and analyses of multitissue transcriptome data.","Overweight and obesity affect over 20% of children worldwide. Emerging evidence shows that nonnutritive sweeteners (NNS) could adversely influence weight gain and metabolic health, particularly during critical periods of development. Thus, we aimed to investigate the impact of prenatal NNS exposure on postnatal growth and adiposity. Among 2298 families participating in the CHILD cohort study, children born to mothers who regularly consumed NNS during pregnancy had elevated body mass index and adiposity at 3 years of age. In a complementary study designed to eliminate confounding by human lifestyle factors and investigate causal mechanisms, we exposed pregnant mice and cultured adipocytes to NNS (aspartame or sucralose) at doses relevant to human consumption. In mice, maternal NNS exposure caused elevated body weight, adiposity and insulin resistance in offspring, especially in males. Further, in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocyte cells, sucralose exposure during early stages of differentiation caused increased lipid accumulation and expression of adipocyte differentiation genes (e.g. C/EBP-\u03b1, FABP4, FAS). The same genes were upregulated in the adipose tissue of male mouse offspring born to sucralose-fed dams. Together, these clinical and experimental findings provide evidence suggesting that maternal NNS consumption induces obesity risk in the offspring through effects on adiposity and adipocyte differentiation.","Somatically acquired whole chromosome loss in nucleated blood cells is an indicator of immune aging and genomic instability. However, little is known about aging, lifestyle and genetic factors influencing mitochondrial (MT) DNA abundance. In this study, MT DNA abundance was estimated from the weighted intensities of probes mapping to the MT genome in 295,150 participants from the UK Biobank. We found that abundance of MT DNA was significantly elevated in women compared to men, was negatively correlated with advanced age, more packyears, greater body-mass index, higher frailty index as well as elevated red and white blood cell count and, importantly, lower mortality. In addition, several biochemistry markers in blood related to cholesterol metabolism, ion homeostasis and kidney function were found to be significantly associated with MT DNA abundance. By performing a genome-wide association study, we identified 50 independent regions genome-wide significantly associated with MT DNA abundance which harbour multiple genes involved in the immune system, cancer as well as mitochondrial function. Using mixed effects models, we estimated the SNP-heritability of MT DNA abundance to be around 8%. To investigate the consequence of altered MT DNA abundance, we performed a phenome-wide association study and found that MT DNA abundance is involved in risk for leukaemia, hematologic diseases as well as hypertension. Thus, estimating MT DNA abundance from genotyping arrays has the potential to provide novel insights into age- and disease relevant processes, particularly those related to immunity and established mitochondrial functions.","","Tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and remains a major health problem worldwide. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify new and more effective drugs to treat emerging multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and to reduce the side effects of anti-TB drugs, such as liver toxicity and other detrimental changes. In this study, to develop a novel candidate drug for effective TB treatment with few side effects in the host, we selected pasakbumin A isolated from Eurycoma longifolia (E. longifolia) Jack, which protected host cells against Mtb infection-induced death. Pasakbumin A significantly inhibited intracellular Mtb growth by inducing autophagy via the ERK1/2-mediated signaling pathway in Mtb-infected macrophages. We further investigated whether pasakbumin A could be used as a potential adjuvant for TB treatment. Treatment with pasakbumin A and the anti-TB drug rifampicin (RMP) potently suppressed intracellular Mtb killing by promoting autophagy as well as TNF-\u03b1 production via the ERK1/2- and NF-\u03baB-mediated signaling pathways in Mtb-infected cells. Our results suggest that pasakbumin A could be developed as a novel anti-TB drug or host-directed therapeutic (HDT) strategy to protect against host cell death and improve host defense mechanisms against Mtb infection in macrophages.","Background The parasitic trematode Fasciola hepatica evades host immune defenses through secretion of various immunomodulatory molecules. Fatty Acid Binding Proteins (fhFABPs) are among the main excreted/secreted proteins and have been shown to display anti-inflammatory properties. However, little is currently known regarding their impact on dendritic cells (DCs) and their subsequent capacity to prime specific CD4+ T cell subsets.","Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a complex inflammatory and debilitating skin disease for which no effective treatment is available. This is partly because of the unavailability of suitable human or animal models with which exact pathobiology of the disease can be defined. Here, we describe the development of air-liquid (A-L) interface, liquid-liquid/liquid-submersion (L-S) and bioreactor (Bio) ex vivo skin culture models. All three ex vivo platforms were effective for culturing skin samples up to day-14, with the tissue architecture and integrity remaining intact for at least 3 days for healthy skin while for 14 days for HS skin. Up to day-3, no significant differences were observed in % early apoptotic cells among all three platforms. However, an increase was observed in late apoptotic/necrotic cells in HS skin at day-3 in A-L and Bio culture of HS skin. These cultures efficiently support the growth of various cells populations, including keratinocytes and immune cells. Profiling of the inflammatory genes using HS skin from these ex vivo cultures showed dynamic expression changes at day-3 and day-14. All of these cultures are necessary to represent the inflammatory gene status of HS skin at day-0 suggesting that not all gene clusters are identically altered in each culture method. Similarly, cytokine/chemokine profiling of the supernatant from vehicle- and drug-treated ex vivo HS cultures again showed better prediction of drug efficacy against HS. Overall, development of these three systems collectively provide a powerful tool to uncover the pathobiology of HS progression and screen various drugs against HS.","Environmental perturbations have large effects on both organismal and cellular traits, including gene expression, but the extent to which the environment affects RNA processing remains largely uncharacterized. Recent studies have identified a large number of genetic variants associated with variation in RNA processing that also have an important role in complex traits; yet we do not know in which contexts the different underlying isoforms are used. Here, we comprehensively characterized changes in RNA processing events across 89 environments in five human cell types and identified 15,300 event shifts (FDR = 15%) comprised of eight event types in over 4,000 genes. Many of these changes occur consistently in the same direction across conditions, indicative of global regulation by trans factors. Accordingly, we demonstrate that environmental modulation of splicing factor binding predicts shifts in intron retention, and that binding of transcription factors predicts shifts in AFE usage in response to specific treatments. We validated the mechanism hypothesized for AFE in two independent datasets. Using ATAC-seq, we found altered binding of 64 factors in response to selenium at sites of AFE shift, including ELF2 and other factors in the ETS family. We also performed AFE QTL mapping in 373 individuals and found an enrichment for SNPs predicted to disrupt binding of the ELF2 factor. Together, these results demonstrate that RNA processing is dramatically changed in response to environmental perturbations through specific mechanisms regulated by trans factors.","BACKGROUND Calcium, vitamin D and insulin resistance are linked to osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease in menopause.","Vitamin D deficiency associates with an increased risk of prostate cancer (PCa) mortality and is hypothesized to contribute to PCa aggressiveness and disparities in African Americans. We previously reported a relationship between African-ancestry, circulating and intraprostatic vitamin D metabolites and prostatic expression of megalin, an endocytic receptor that internalizes globulin-bound hormones. Here, we show prostatic 5\u03b1-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels are higher in African American men and inversely correlate with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25D) status. We further demonstrate that megalin imports sex hormone-binding globulin-bound testosterone in prostate cells and prostatic loss of Lrp2 (megalin) results in reduced prostate androgen levels. Megalin expression was suppressed by 25D and DHT in cell lines, patient-derived prostate epithelial cells, and prostate tissue explants, supporting a negative feedback loop. Megalin levels are reduced in localized PCa by Gleason Grade and in patients with future disease recurrence. Our findings highlight the impact of vitamin D deficiency on prostate androgen levels, which are known drivers of PCa, and reveal a potential mechanistic link between vitamin D and the PCa disparities observed in African Americans.","Recently, many epidemiological and animal studies have indicated that obesity have their origin in the early stages of life including the inappropriate balance of some nutrients, the objective of this study is to determine the risk of obesity in male mice offspring as a consequence of maternal VD deficiency-mediated disordering of the immune response. Four-week-old C57BL/6J female mice were fed VD-deficient or normal reproductive diets during pregnancy and lactation. Their male offspring were weighted and euthanized after being fed control and high-fat diets (HFD) for 16 weeks starting at the weaning. The serum was collected for biochemical analyses. Epididymal (eWAT) and inguinal (iWAT) white adipose tissues were excised for histological examination, immunohistochemistry, gene expressions of inflammatory factors, and for determining the proportions of immune cells by flow cytometry. Insufficient maternal VD intake exacerbated the development of obesity both in non-obese and obese male offspring as evidenced by larger adipose cells and abnormal glucose and lipid metabolisms. Also, the expression of proinflammatory cytokine genes was increased and that of anti-inflammatory cytokines was decreased in maternal VD-deficient groups in the eWAT and/or iWAT. This was accompanied by higher levels of TNF-\u03b1 or/and INF-\u03b2, and lower levels of IL-4 and IL-10. Insufficient maternal VD intake was also observed to induce a shift in the profiles of immune cells in the eWAT and/or iWAT, resulting in increased percentages of M1 macrophage, ATDCs, and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, but caused a significant decrease in the percentage of M2 macrophages, both in non-obese and obese male offspring. All these changes in the immune cell profile were more obvious in the eWAT than in the iWAT. These results indicated that insufficient maternal VD intake promoted the development of obesity in male offspring by modulating the immune cell populations and causing a polarization in the adipose depots.","Importance CIS to MS conversion rates vary depending on population cohorts, initial manifestations, and durations of follow-up.","Although hyaline cartilage is widely distributed in various invertebrate groups such as sabellid polychaetes, molluscs (cephalopods, gastropods) and a chelicerate arthropod group (horseshoe crabs), the enigmatic relationship and distribution of cartilage in taxonomic groups remains to be explained. It can be interpreted as a convergent trait in animal evolution and thus does not seem to be a vertebrate invention. Due to the poor fossil record of cartilaginous structures, occurrences of mineralized fossil cartilages are important for evolutionary biology and paleontology. Although the biochemical composition of recent cephalopod cartilage differs from vertebrate cartilage, histologically the cartilages of these animal groups resemble one another remarkably. In this study we present fossil material from the late Triassic Polzberg Konservat-Lagerst\u00e4tte near Lunz am See (Lower Austria, Northern Calcareous Alps). A rich Carnian fauna is preserved here, whereby a morphogroup (often associated with coleoid remains) of black, amorphous appearing fossils still remained undetermined. These multi-elemental, mirroring fossils show remarkable similarities to recent cephalopod cartilage. We examined the conspicuous micro- and ultrastructure of these enigmatic fossils by thin-sectioning and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The geochemical composition analyzed by Microprobe and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) revealed carbonisation as the taphonomic pathway for this fossil group. 3D preservation of this otherwise degradable soft tissue can be explained by the mineralization processes that may take place in particular environments. Fifty-nine specimens from the Polzberg locality and five specimens from Cave del Predil (formerly Raibl, Julian Alps, Italy) underwent extensive studies. The detected grooves are interpreted to be muscular attachment areas, and the preserved branched system of canaliculi is comparable to a channel system that is also present in recent coleoid cartilage. The new findings on these long-known enigmatic structures strongly point to the preservation of cranial cartilage belonging to the belemnoid Phragmoteuthis bisinuata.","Bats are increasingly studied as model systems for longevity and as natural hosts for some virulent viruses. Yet our ability to characterize immune mechanisms of viral tolerance and to quantify infection dynamics in wild bats is often limited by small sample volumes and few species-specific reagents. Here, we demonstrate how proteomics can overcome these limitations by using data-independent acquisition-based shotgun proteomics to survey the serum proteome of 17 vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) from Belize. Using just 2 \u03bcL of sample and relatively short separations of undepleted serum digests, we identified 361 proteins across five orders of magnitude. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD022885. Levels of immunological proteins in vampire bat serum were then compared to human plasma via published databases. Of particular interest were anti-viral and anti-bacterial components, circulating 20S proteasome complex, and proteins involved in redox activity; whether any results are specific to vampire bats could be assessed by future pan-mammalian analyses. Lastly, we used known virus proteomes to identify Rh186 from Macacine herpesvirus 3 and ORF1a from Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, indicating that mass spectrometry-based techniques show promise for pathogen detection. Overall, these results can be used to design targeted mass-spectrometry assays to quantify immunological markers and detect pathogens. More broadly, our findings also highlight the application of proteomics in advancing wildlife immunology and pathogen surveillance.","BNIP3 is a BH3 only protein with both pro-apoptotic and pro-survival roles depending on the cellular context. It remains unclear how BNIP3 RNA level dictates cell fate decisions of cancer cells. Here we undertook a quantitative analysis of BNIP3 expression and functions in single cell datasets of various epithelial malignancies. Our results demonstrated that BNIP3 upregulation characterizes cancer cell subpopulations with increased fitness and proliferation. We further validated the upregulation of BNIP3 in liver cancer organoids compared with 2D culture. Taken together, the combination of in silico perturbations using public single cell datasets and experimental cancer modeling using organoids ushered in a new approach to address cancer heterogeneity.","Background Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) are the main side effects of statins. Currently, there are no effective biomarkers for accurate clinical diagnosis. Urine is not subject to homeostatic control and therefore accumulates early changes, making it an ideal biomarker source. We therefore examined urine proteome changes associated with SAMS in an animal model.","Some studies have shown that efficacious drug combination can increase the therapeutic effect, and decrease drug toxicity and side-effects. Thus, drug combinations have been widely used in the treatment of complex diseases, especially cancer. However, experiment-based methods are extremely costly in time and money. Computational models can greatly reduce the cost, but most of the models do not use the data of more than two drugs and lose a lot of useful information. Here, we used high-order drug combination information and developed a hypergraph random walk with restart model (HRWR) for efficacious drug combination prediction.","Streptomyces griseofuscus DSM 40191 is a fast growing Streptomyces strain that remains largely underexplored as a heterologous host. Here, we report the genome mining of S. griseofuscus, followed by the detailed exploration of its phenotype, including production of native secondary metabolites and ability to utilise carbon, nitrogen, sulphur and phosphorus sources. Furthermore, several routes for genetic engineering of S. griseofuscus were explored, including use of GusA-based vectors, CRISPR-Cas9 and CRISPR-cBEST-mediated knockouts. Using CRISPR-BEST technology, core genes of 4 biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) that are situated on the chromosome arms were inactivated and the outcomes of the inactivations were tested. Two out of the three native plasmids were cured using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, leading to the generation of strain S. griseofuscus DEL1. DEL1 was further modified by full deletion of a pentamycin BGC and an unknown NRPS BGC, leading to the generation of strain DEL2, lacking approx. 500 kbp of the genome, which corresponds to a 5,19% genome reduction. Sequencing confirmed that DEL2 does not bear any crucial off-target effects or rearrangements in its genome. It can be characterized by faster growth and inability to produce three main native metabolites of S. griseofuscus: lankacidin, lankamycin, pentamycin and their derivatives. To test the ability of DEL2 to heterologously produce secondary metabolites, the actinorhodin BGC was used. We were able to confirm the production of actinorhodin by both S. griseofuscus wild type and DEL2. We believe that this strain will serve as a good chassis for heterologous expression of BGCs.","Measurement of broad types of proteins from a small number of cells to single cells would help to better understand the nervous system but requires significant leaps in high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) sensitivity. Microanalytical capillary electrophoresis electrospray ionization (\u03bcCE-ESI) offers a path to ultrasensitive proteomics by integrating scalability with sensitivity. We report here a data acquisition strategy that expands the detectable and quantifiable proteome in trace amounts of digests using \u03bcCE-ESI-HRMS. Data-dependent acquisition (DDA) was programmed to progressively exclude high-intensity peptide signals during repeated measurements. These nested experiments formed rungs of our \u201cDDA ladder.\u201d The method was tested for replicates analyzing ~500 pg of protein digest from cultured hippocampal (primary) neurons (mouse), which estimates to the total amount of protein from a single neuron. Analysis of net amounts approximating to ~10 neurons identified 428 nonredundant proteins (415 quantified), an ~35% increase over traditional DDA. The identified proteins were enriched in neuronal marker genes and molecular pathways of neurobiological importance. The DDA ladder deepens the detectable proteome from trace amounts of proteins, expanding the analytical toolbox of neuroscience.","Previous therapeutic attempts to deplete cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) or inhibit their proliferation in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) were not successful in mice or patients. Thus, CAFs may be tumor suppressive or heterogeneous, with distinct cancer-restraining and -promoting CAFs (rCAFs and pCAFs, respectively). Here, we show that induced expression of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein Meflin, a rCAF-specific marker, in CAFs by genetic and pharmacological approaches improved the chemosensitivity of mouse PDAC. A chemical library screen identified Am80, a synthetic, non-natural retinoid, as a reagent that effectively induced Meflin expression in CAFs. Am80 administration improved the sensitivity of PDAC to chemotherapeutics, accompanied by increases in tumor vessel area and intratumoral drug delivery. Mechanistically, Meflin was involved in the suppression of tissue stiffening by interacting with lysyl oxidase to inhibit its collagen crosslinking activity. These data suggested that modulation of CAF heterogeneity may represent a strategy for PDAC treatment.","Intronless genes (IGs) or single-exon genes lacking an intron are found across most Eukaryotes. Notably, IGs display a higher transcriptional fidelity as they are not regulated through alternative splicing, suggesting better predictability biomarkers and easier regulation as targets for therapy. Cancer is a complex disease that relies on progressive uncontrolled cell division linked with multiple dysfunctional biological processes. Tumor heterogeneity remains the most challenging feature in cancer diagnosis and treatment. Given the clinical relevance of IGs, we aim to identify their unique expression profiles and interactome, that may act as functional signatures across eight different cancers. We identified 940 protein-coding IGs in the human genome, of which about 35% were differentially expressed across the analyzed cancer datasets. Specifically, \u223c78% of differentially expressed IGs were undergoing transcriptional reprogramming with elevated expression in tumor cells. Remarkably, in all the studied tumors, a highly conserved induction of a group of deacetylase-histones located in a region of chromosome 6 enriched in nucleosome and chromatin condensation processes. This study highlights that differentially expressed human intronless genes across cancer types are prevalent in epigenetic regulatory roles participating in specific PPI networks for ESCA, GBM, and LUAD tumors. We determine that IGs play a key role in the tumor phenotype at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, with important mechanisms such as interactomics rewiring.","Bilateria are the predominant clade of animals on earth. Despite having evolved a large variety of body-plans and developmental modes, they are characterized by common morphological traits. However, it is not clear if clade-specific genes can be linked to these traits, distinguishing bilaterians from non-bilaterians, with their less complex body morphology. Comparing proteomes of bilaterian and non-bilaterian species in an elaborate computational pipeline we aimed to find and define a set of of bilaterian-specific genes. Finding no high-confidence set of such genes, we nevertheless detected an evolutionary signal possibly uniting the highly diverse bilaterian taxa. Using a novel multi-species GO-enrichment method, we determined the functional repertoire of genes that are widely conserved among Bilateria. We found that these genes contribute to morphogenesis, neuronal-system and muscle development, processes that have been described as different between bilaterians and non-bilaterians. Analyzing gene expression profiles in three very distantly related bilaterina species, we find characteristic peaks at comparable stages of development and a delayed onset of expression in embryos. In particular, the expression of the conserved genes appears to peak at the phylotypic stage of different bilaterian phyla. In summary, our data underpin the orthologue conjecture and illustrate how development connects distantly related Bilateria after millions of years of divergence, pointing to processes potentially separating them from non-bilaterians.","Monocyte to macrophage differentiation is an extremely essential cellular and immunological process aimed to combat the assault of foreign pathogens as well as this process has immense importance in the maintenance of physiological homeostasis. Differentiated macrophage, serving as specialized phagocytes is an indispensable component of innate immunity. Besides this, being a well-documented antigen-presenting cell (APC) macrophages also function as a key regulator of both humoral and cell-mediated immunity: the two integral components of adaptive immunity. Bacterial hopanoids are a primitive analogous of eukaryotic sterols that are established as a prominent immunomodulator. In this study, we have demonstrated the isolation protocol of neutral lipid fractions from different Gram-negative bacteria, and adopting several analytical approaches we proposed that the extracted lipid fractions may contain hopanoid as an active component. We have delved deeper into the biological effect of these probable hopanoids like compounds. Here, by considering the several structural and functional attributes like altered phenotype, expression of macrophage-specific markers, increased intracellular organelles, acquirement of enhanced phagocytic and inflammatory property, induction of autophagy, etc we have established hopanoids as a potential inducer of monocyte to macrophage differentiation. Thus, our study has unraveled a new immunomodulator present in Gram-negative bacteria and would undoubtedly help to understand the intricacies of host-pathogen interaction in a better and conclusive manner.","IgE is the least abundant circulating antibody class but is constitutively present in healthy tissues bound to resident cells via its high-affinity receptor, Fc\u03b5RI. The physiological role of endogenous IgE is unclear but it is suggested to provide host protection against a variety of noxious environmental substances and parasitic infections at epithelial barrier surfaces. Here we show that skin inflammation enhances levels of IgE with natural specificities and with a similar repertoire, VDJ rearrangements and CDRH3 characteristics as in healthy tissue. IgE-bearing basophils are recruited to inflamed skin via CXCL12 and TSLP/IL-3-dependent upregulation of CXCR4. In the inflamed skin, IgE/Fc\u03b5RI-signalling in basophils promotes epithelial cell growth and differentiation, partly through histamine engagement of H1R and H4R. Furthermore, this natural IgE response strongly drives tumour outgrowth of epithelial cells harbouring oncogenic mutation. These findings indicate that natural IgE support skin barrier defences however during chronic tissue inflammation this may be subverted to promote tumour growth.","The study of the foreign body reaction to implanted electrodes in the brain is an important area of research for the future development of neuroprostheses and experimental electrophysiology. After electrode implantation in the brain, microglial activation, reactive astrogliosis, and neuronal cell death create an environment immediately surrounding the electrode that is significantly altered from its homeostatic state. To uncover physiological changes potentially affecting device function and longevity, spatial transcriptomics was implemented in this preliminary study to identify changes in gene expression driven by electrode implantation. This RNA-sequencing technique (10x Genomics, Visium) uses spatially coded, RNA-binding oligonucleotides on a microscope slide to spatially identify each sequencing read. For these experiments, sections of rat motor cortex implanted with Michigan-style silicon electrodes were mounted on the Visium slide for processing. Each tissue section was labeled for neurons and astrocytes using immunohistochemistry to provide a spatial reference for mapping each sequencing read relative to the device tract. Results from rat motor cortex at 24 hours, 1 week, and 6 weeks post implantation showed up to 5811 differentially expressed genes between implanted and non-implanted tissue sections. Many of these genes are related to biological mechanisms previously reported in studies of the foreign body response to implanted electrodes, while others are novel to this study. These results will provide a foundation for future work to both improve and measure the effects of gene expression on the long-term stability of recordings from implanted electrodes in the brain. Ongoing work will expand on these initial observations as we gain a better understanding of the dynamic, molecular changes taking place in the brain in response to electrode implantation.","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally and circulate in the blood, making them attractive biomarkers of disease state for tissues like bone that are challenging to interrogate directly. Here we report on five miRNAs \u2013 miR-197-3p, miR-320a, miR-320b, miR-331-5p, and miR-423-5p \u2013 that are associated with bone mineral density (BMD) in 147 healthy adult baboons. These baboons range in age from 15 to 25 years (45 to 75 human equivalent years) and were 65% female with a broad range of BMDs including a minority of osteopenic individuals. miRNAs were generated via RNA sequencing from buffy coats collected at necropsy and areal BMD evaluated via DXA of the lumbar vertebrae post-mortem. Differential expression analysis controlled for the underlying pedigree structure of these animals to account for genetic variation which may be driving miRNA abundance and BMD values. While many of these miRNAs have been associated with risk of human osteoporosis, this finding is of interest because the cohort represent a model of normal aging and bone metabolism rather than a disease cohort. The replication of miRNA associations with osteoporosis or other bone metabolic disorders in animals with healthy BMD suggests an overlap in normal variation and disease states. We suggest that these miRNAs are involved in the regulation of cellular proliferation, apoptosis, and protein composition in the extracellular matrix throughout life. However, age-related dysregulation of these systems may lead to disease causing associations of the miRNAs among individuals with clinically defined disease.","Collagen is the most abundant secreted protein in vertebrates that persists throughout life without renewal. The unchanging nature of collagen contrasts with observed continued collagen synthesis throughout adulthood and with conventional transcriptional and translational homeostatic mechanisms that replace damaged proteins with new copies. Here we show circadian clock regulation of procollagen transport from ER-to-Golgi and Golgi-to-plasma membrane by sequential rhythmic expression of SEC61, TANGO1, PDE4D and VPS33B. The result is nocturnal procollagen synthesis and daytime collagen fibril assembly in mice. Rhythmic collagen degradation by CTSK maintains collagen homeostasis. This circadian cycle of collagen synthesis, assembly and degradation affects only a pool of newly-synthesized collagen whilst maintaining the persistent collagen network. Disabling the circadian clock causes collagen accumulation and abnormal fibrils in vivo. In conclusion, our study has identified a circadian clock mechanism of protein homeostasis in which a sacrificial pool of collagen is synthesized and removed to maintain tissue function.","The schizophrenia and bipolar disorder associated gene, BRD1, encodes a scaffold protein that in complex with epigenetic modifiers regulate gene sets enriched for psychiatric disorder risk. Preclinical evidence from male Brd1+/\u2212 mice has previously implicated BRD1 with phenotypes of translational relevance to schizophrenia. Here we describe the phenotype of female Brd1+/\u2212 mice and report attenuated dendritic architecture and monoaminergic dysregulation accompanied by sex-specific changes in affective behaviors. In accordance, global gene expression profiling reveals regional dysregulation of gene sets enriched with major depressive disorder and schizophrenia risk in female and male Brd1+/\u2212 mice, respectively. Independent of sex, however, differentially expressed genes cluster in common functional pathways associated with psychiatric disorders, including mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative phosphorylation as well as G-protein coupled-, and nuclear receptor mediated signaling. Accordingly, we provide in vitro evidence that BRD1 modulates the transcriptional drive of a subset of nuclear receptors (e.g. the vitamin D and glucocorticoid receptors). Moreover, we demonstrate enrichment of psychiatric disorder risk in the target genes of nuclear receptors, sex-biased expression of several nuclear receptor genes in the adult brain of Brd1+/\u2212 mice, and that sex-biased genes in general are enriched with nuclear receptor genes particularly at the earliest developmental stage of the human brain. Overall, our data suggests that the spatio-temporal interaction between BRD1 and subsets of nuclear receptors in the brain is sex-biased and that hampered BRD1 mediated regulation of target genes governed by certain nuclear receptors may significantly contribute to sex differences in psychopathology.","Guangxi is one of the provinces having the highest reported incidence of tuberculosis (TB) in China. However, spatial and temporal pattern and causation of the situation are still unclear. In order to detect the spatiotemporal pattern of TB and the association with ecological environment factors in Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, China, We performed a spatiotemporal analysis with prediction using time series analysis, Moran\u2019s I global and local spatial autocorrelation statistics, and space-time scan statistics, to detect temporal and spatial clusters. Spatial panel models were employed to identify the influence factors. The time series analysis shows that the number of reported cases peaked in spring and summer and decreased in autumn and winter with the annual reported incidence of 113.1/100,000 population. Moran\u2019s I global statistics were greater than 0 (0.363 \u2013 0.536) during the study period. The most significant hot spots were mainly located in the central part. The east part exhibited a low-low relation. By spacetime scanning, the clusters identified were similar to that of the local autocorrelation statistics, and were clustered toward the early of 2016. Duration of sunshine, per capita gross domestic product (PGDP), the recovery rate of TB and participation rate of new cooperative medical care insurance in rural areas had a significant negative association with TB. In conclusion, the reported incidence of TB in Guangxi remains high. The main cluster was located in the central part of Guangxi, a region where promoting the productivity, improving TB treatment pathway and strengthening environmental protective measures (increasing sunshine exposure) are urgently needed.","Myocardial infarction is a leading cause of death worldwide, as the adult human heart does not have the ability to regenerate efficiently after insults. In contrast, the adult zebrafish heart has a high capacity for regeneration, and understanding the mechanisms of regenerative processes in fish allows identification of novel therapeutic strategies. While several pro-regenerative factors have been described, the cell types orchestrating heart regeneration remain largely elusive. To overcome this conceptual limitation, we dissected cell type diversity in the regenerating zebrafish heart based on single cell transcriptomics and spatiotemporal analysis. We discovered a dramatic induction of several pro-regenerative cell types with fibroblast characteristics. To understand the cascade of events leading to heart regeneration, we determined the origin of these cell types by high-throughput lineage tracing. We found that pro-regenerative fibroblasts are derived from two separate sources, the epicardium and the endocardium. Mechanistically, we identified Wnt signaling as a key regulator of the endocardial regenerative response. In summary, our results uncover specialized fibroblast cell types as major drivers of heart regeneration, thereby opening up new possibilities to interfere with the regenerative capacity of the vertebrate heart.","The overuse of antibiotics is accelerating the bacterial resistance, and therefore there is a need to reduce the amount of antibiotics used for treatment. Here, we demonstrate that specific wavelengths in a narrow range around 296 nm are able to eradicate bacteria in the biofilm state more effectively, than antibiotics and the combination of irradiation and antibiotics is even better, introducing a novel concept light assisted antibiotics. The investigated wavelength range was 249 nm to 338 nm with an approximate step of 5 nm. The novel concept can significantly reduce the amount of antibiotics needed for eradicating mature bacterial biofilms. The irradiation treatment was combined with tobramycin and its efficiency was compared to combinatory antibiotic treatment and highly concentrated antibiotic monotherapy. The eradication efficacies, on mature biofilms, achieved by light assisted antibiotic and by the antibiotic monotherapy at 10-fold higher concentration, were equivalent. The present achievement could motivate the development of light assisted antibiotic treatments for treating infections.","A major aspect of our daily lives is the need to acquire, store and prepare our food. Storage and preparation can have drastic effects on the compositional chemistry of our foods, but we have a limited understanding of the temporal nature of processes such as storage, spoilage, fermentation and brewing on the chemistry of the foods we eat. Here, we performed a temporal analysis of the chemical changes in foods during common household preparations using untargeted mass spectrometry and novel data analysis approaches. Common treatments of foods such as home fermentation of yogurt, brewing of tea, spoilage of meats and ripening of tomatoes altered the chemical makeup through time, through both chemical and biological processes. For example, brewing tea altered its composition by increasing the diversity of molecules, but this change was halted after 4 min of brewing. The results indicate that this is largely due to differential extraction of the material from the tea and not modification of the molecules during the brewing process. This is in contrast to the preparation of yogurt from milk, spoilage of meat and the ripening of tomatoes where biological transformations directly altered the foods molecular composition. Comprehensive assessment of chemical changes using multivariate statistics showed the varied impacts of the different food treatments, while analysis of individual chemical changes show specific alterations of chemical families in the different food types. The methods developed here represent novel approaches to studying the changes in food chemistry that can reveal global alterations in chemical profiles and specific transformations at the chemical level.","Background Among middle-aged and elderly individuals, dietary habits have previously been reported to differ between patients with and without periodontal disease. However, in young adults, there are only a few reports that show a correlation between nutrient/food intake and periodontal disease. Moreover, no report has assessed the correlation between dietary habits measured by a self-administered diet history questionnaire (DHQ) and periodontal disease. Therefore, we assessed the correlation between dietary habits, determined using a DHQ, and periodontal disease in young adult women who are likely to develop a periodontal disease.","The relationship between vitamin D and reactive oxygen species (ROS), two integral signaling and damaging molecules of the cell, is poorly understood. This is striking, given that both factors are involved in cancer cell regulation and metabolism. Mitochondria (mt) dysfunction is one of the main drivers of cancer, producing higher cellular energy and ROS that can enhance oxidative stress and stress tolerance responses. To study the effects of vitamin D on metabolic and mt dysfunction, we used the vitamin D receptor (VDR)-sensitive MG-63 osteosarcoma cell model. Using biochemical approaches, active vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, 1,25(OH)2D3) decreased mt ROS levels, membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8mt), biogenesis, and translation, while enforcing endoplasmic reticulum/mitohormetic stress tolerance responses. Using a mitochondria-focused transcriptomic approach, gene set enrichment and pathway analyses show that 1,25(OH)2D3 lowered mt fusion/fission and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). By contrast, mitophagy, ROS defense, and epigenetic gene regulation were enhanced after 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment, as well as key metabolic enzymes that regulate fluxes of substrates for cellular architecture and a shift toward non-oxidative energy metabolism. ATACseq revealed putative oxi-sensitive and tumor-suppressing transcription factors that may regulate important mt functional genes such as the mTORC1 inhibitor, DDIT4/REDD1. DDIT4/REDD1 was predominantly localized to the outer mt membrane in untreated MG-63 cells yet sequestered in the cytoplasm after 1,25(OH)2D3 and rotenone treatments, suggesting a level of control by membrane depolarization to facilitate its cytoplasmic mTORC1 inhibitory function. The results show that vitamin D activates distinct adaptive metabolic responses involving mitochondria to regain redox balance and control the growth of cancer cells.","The mosquito microbiota impacts the physiology of its host and is essential for normal larval development, thereby influencing transmission of vector-borne pathogens. Germ-free mosquitoes generated with current methods show larval stunting and developmental deficits. Therefore, functional studies of the mosquito microbiota have so far mostly been limited to antibiotic treatments of emerging adults. In this study, we developed a novel approach to produce germ-free Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. It is based on reversible colonisation with bacteria genetically modified to allow complete decolonisation at any developmental stage. We show that, unlike germ-free mosquitoes previously produced using sterile diets, reversibly colonised mosquitoes show no developmental retardation and reach the same size as control adults. This allowed us to uncouple the study of the microbiota in larvae and adults. In adults, we detected no impact of bacterial colonisation on mosquito fecundity or longevity. In larvae, we performed a transcriptome analysis and diet supplementation experiments following decolonisation during the third larval instar. Our data suggest that bacteria support larval development by contributing to folate biosynthesis and by enhancing energy storage. Our study establishes a novel tool to study the microbiota in insects and deepens our knowledge on the metabolic contribution of bacteria to mosquito development.","Superoxide, a form of reactive oxygen species (ROS), is catabolized by superoxide dismutase (SOD) and contributes to carcinogenesis via the oxidative damage it inflicts on cells. The aim of this research was to analyze the potential vitamin D-mediated regulation of the antioxidative \u201cSOD1-to-SOD2 switch\u201d within the human MG-63 osteosarcoma model. For this study, real-time PCR analysis was performed using MG-63 cells exposed to metabolically active 1,25(OH)2D3. Frist, a sustained statistically significant &gt;2-fold suppression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) transcripts was observed after 10nM but not at 100nM of 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment, suggesting a cytostatic effect. In order to assess regulators of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, gene expression of COX2 and COX4l1 of the mitochondrial complex IV and antioxidative enzymes (SOD1, SOD2 and Catalase (CAT)) were monitored. For COX2 and COX4l1, no changes in gene expression were observed. However, a concomitant decrease in CAT and SOD1 mRNA, and increase in SOD2 mRNA after 24 hours of 10nM 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment were observed. A ~8-fold increase in SOD2 mRNA was apparent after 48 hours. The significant increase in SOD2 activity in the presence of vitamin D indicates an antioxidant potential and sensitization of vitamin D during osteosarcoma transformation and mitochondrial detoxification over time.","Mechanisms relating the gut bacteria to Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) have been proposed containing the dysbiosis-induced dysregulation of hepatic lipid metabolism that allows for the translocation of microbial components and leads to hepatic inflammation and steatosis. Andrographolide (AG) regulates inflammation mediated by NF-\u03baB pathway which also play a key role in reduction of inflammation and fibrosis in experimental nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), yet the mechanisms linking this effect to gut microbiota remain obscure. Here we show that ApoE knockout (Apoe -/-) mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) supplemented with AG regulates levels of biochemical index and inflammatory cytokines associated with gut microbe. Moreover, HEPG2 cells induced by ox-LDL were used as validation in vitro. H&amp;E staining and Oil-Red staining were respectively used for tissue and cells morphology. Gut microbiota were examined by 16S rRNA sequencing. Expression of NF-\u03baB, C/EBP\u03b2 and PPAR-\u03b3 in liver and HEPG2 cells were detected by western blot and qRT-PCR. The results showed, among others, that AG alleviate hepatic steatosis and fat content in HEPG2 cells, while it induced decreased levels of Bacteroides, and increased levels of Faecalibaculum, Akkermansia. We further identified that inhibition of NF-\u03baB/C/EBP\u03b2/PPAR-\u03b3 pathway of hepatic steatosis model in vivo and vitro by AG also contributes to prevention of HFD-induced inflammation and dislipidemia. Importantly, as result of pearson correlation, Bacteroides may be the most relevant one fundamentally involved in the mechanism of AG attenuates NAFLD. Together, our findings uncover an interaction between AG and gut microbiota as a novel mechanism for the anti-NAFLD effect of AG acting through prevention of microbial dysbiosis, dislipidemia and inflammation.","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short single-stranded non-coding RNA molecules, which are involved in regulation of main biological processes, such as apoptosis, cell proliferation and differentiation, through sequence-specific interaction with target mRNAs. In this study we propose a workflow for predicting miRNAs function by analyzing the structure of the network of their target genes. This workflow was applied to study the functional role of miR-375 in the heart muscle (myocardium), since this miRNA was previously shown to be associated with heart diseases and data on its function in myocardium are mostly unclear. We identified PIK3CA, RHOA, MAPK3, PAFAH1B1, CTNNB1, MYC, PRKCA, ERBB2, and CDC42 as key genes in the miR-375 regulated network and predicted the possible function of miR-375 in the heart muscle, consisting mainly in the regulation of the Rho-GTPases-dependent signalling pathways.","Cathelicidin antimicrobial peptides are a diverse family of cationic amphipathic peptides with multiple activities. In humans, cathelicidin LL-37 is one of the main host defense peptides with a remarkable medical and biotechnological potential. Deregulation of LL-37 expression has been associated with inflammatory diseases. However the effects of point mutations driven by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on LL-37 are unknown. Here we applied an array of computational tools to investigate the effects of such mutations on LL-37 structure and activity. Due to the fact that, on cathelicidins, the prodomain is more conserved than the mature peptide, the SNP effect predictions were biased and, overall, resulted in neutral effects; and due to the slight changes in physicochemical properties, the antimicrobial predictions indicated the maintenance of such activity. Nonetheless, six out of eleven mutations altered the positive net charge, which in turn could result in less active LL-37 variants. Molecular dynamics data indicated that R07Q and N30Y mutations altered the LL-37 structure. In addition to these ones, the G03A, R07P, R07W and L31P mutations altered the helix dipole, which could also alter the antimicrobial activity. Our results indicated despite the mutations did not alter the residues from LL-37 active core, they could influence the antimicrobial activity and consequently, could be involved in inflammatory diseases.","We have recently mapped a 296 bp deletion at the mouse hairless locus that causes the mutation hairless rhino bald Mill Hill, (Hrrhbmh), (ID:MGI:3039558; J:89321), removing the stop codon and generating a larger mutant protein HR bmh with an additional sequence of 117 amino acids. The mutant hairless gene mRNA is expressed during the embryonic and post-natal development of the hair follicle. A mutant HR protein was identified in bmh mouse skin at different stages of development by a specific antibody. We demonstrated that the HR bmh protein is able to interact with the vitamin D receptor, but is not able to repress VDR-mediated transactivation. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that HR bmh protein displays an abnormal cellular localization in transfected cell lines, as well as in the epidermis and hair follicle of bmh mutant mice. Here we analyse the patterns of HR bmh extra-nuclear localization in cell transfection experiments. Using a candidate approach, double transfection experiments, immunofluorescent staining and IP protocols we established that HR bmh co-localizes specifically with the proteins HDAC6 in the cytoplasm is able to physically interact with it. Blast analysis allowed to show that HDAC6 and share high sequence homologies with specific motifs of HR bmh. We studied the association of these potential interactors with various cytoplasmic compartments. We discuss the relevance of the mutant hairless protein mis-localization in endosomal processing and in proteasome related pathways with respect to the specific skin phenotype of mouse hairless mutants.","Inter-chemical correlations in metabolomics and exposomics datasets provide valuable information for studying relationships among reported chemicals measured in human specimens. With an increase in the size of these datasets, a network graph analysis and visualization of the correlation structure is difficult to interpret. While co-regulatory genes databases have been developed, a similar database for metabolites and chemicals have not been developed yet. We have developed the Integrated Data Science Laboratory for Metabolomics and Exposomics - Chemical Correlation Database (IDSL.CCDB), as a systematic catalogue of inter-chemical correlation in publicly available metabolomics and exposomics studies. The database has been provided via an online interface to create single compound-centric views that are clear, readable and meaningful. We have demonstrated various applications of the database to explore: 1) the chemicals from a chemical class such as Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), phthalates and tobacco smoke related metabolites; 2) xenobiotic metabolites such as caffeine and acetaminophen; 3) endogenous metabolites (acyl-carnitines); and 4) unannotated peaks for PFAS. The database has a rich collection of 36 human studies, including the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and high-quality untargeted metabolomics datasets. IDSL.CCDB is supported by a simple, interactive and user-friendly web-interface to retrieve and visualize the inter-chemical correlation data. The IDSL.CCDB has the potential to be a key computational resource in metabolomics and exposomics facilitating the expansion of our understanding about biological and chemical relationships among metabolites and chemical exposures in the human body. The database is available at www.ccdb.idsl.me site.","Background Dermal fibrosis occurs in many human diseases, particularly systemic sclerosis (SSc) where persistent inflammation leads to collagen deposition and fiber formation in skin and multiple organs. The family of protein kinase D (PKD) has been linked to inflammatory responses in various pathological conditions, however, its role in inflammation-induced dermal fibrosis has not been well defined. Here, using a murine fibrosis model that gives rise to dermal lesions similar to those in SSc, we investigated the role of PKD in dermal fibrosis in mice lacking PKD2 activity.","Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a devastating psychiatric disorder affecting a large portion of the population. Unfortunately, efficacious medications to treat the disease are limited and thus AUD represents an area of unmet medical need. mTORC1 plays a crucial role in neuroadaptations underlying alcohol use. mTORC1 also contributes to alcohol craving, habit, and relapse. Thus, mTORC1 inhibitors are promising therapeutic agents to treat AUD. However, chronic inhibition of mTORC1 in the periphery produces undesirable side effects in humans, which limit their potential clinical use for the treatment of AUD. To overcome these limitations, we utilized a binary drug strategy in which mice were co-administered the mTORC1 inhibitor RapaLink-1 together with a novel small molecule (RapaBlock) to protect mTORC1 activity in the periphery. We show that the dual administration of RapaLink-1 with RapaBlock, abolishes RapaLink-1-dependent mTORC1 inhibition in the liver and blocks adverse side effects detected in humans including body weight loss, glucose intolerance and liver toxicity. Importantly, we show that co-administration of RapaLink-1 and RapaBlock inhibits alcohol-dependent mTORC1 activation in the Nucleus Accumbens and robustly moderates the level of alcohol use. Our data present a novel approach that could be used to treat individuals suffering from AUD.","Co-option of transposable elements (TEs) to become part of existing or new enhancers is an important mechanism for evolution of gene regulation. However, contributions of lineage-specific TE insertions to recent regulatory adaptations remain poorly understood. Gibbons present a suitable model to study these contributions as they have evolved a lineage-specific TE called LAVA, which is still active in the gibbon genome. The LAVA retrotransposon is thought to have played a role in the emergence of the unusually rearranged structure of the gibbon genome by disrupting transcription of cell cycle genes. In this study, we investigated whether LAVA may have also contributed to the evolution of gene regulation by adopting enhancer function. We characterized fixed and polymorphic LAVA insertions across multiple gibbons and found 96 LAVA elements overlapping enhancer chromatin states. Moreover, LAVA was enriched in multiple transcription factor binding motifs, was bound by an important transcription factor (PU.1), and was associated with higher levels of gene expression in cis. We found gibbon-specific signatures of purifying/positive selection at 27 LAVA insertions. Two of these insertions were fixed in the gibbon lineage and overlapped with enhancer chromatin states, representing putative co-opted LAVA enhancers. These putative enhancers were located within genes encoding SETD2 and RAD9A, two proteins that facilitate accurate repair of DNA double-strand breaks and prevent chromosomal rearrangement mutations. Thus, LAVA\u2019s co-option in these genes may have influenced regulation of processes that preserve genome integrity. Our findings highlight the importance of considering lineage-specific TEs in studying evolution of novel gene regulatory elements.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Currently, there are a limited number of effective treatments. A variety of drugs that have been approved for other diseases are being tested for the treatment of COVID-19, and thus far only remdesevir, dexamethasone, baricitinib, tofacitinib, tocilizumab, and sarilumab have been recommended by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel for the therapeutic management of hospitalized adults with COVID-19. Using a disease biology modeling approach, we constructed a protein-protein interactome network based on COVID-19- associated genes/proteins described in research literature together with known protein-protein interactions in epithelial cells. Phenotype and disease enrichment analysis of the COVID-19 disease biology model demonstrated strong statistical enrichments consistent with patients\u2019 clinical presentation. The model was used to interrogate host biological response induced by SARS-CoV-2 and identify COVID-19 drug treatment candidates that may inform on drugs currently being evaluated or provide insight into possible targets for potential new therapeutic agents. We focused on cancer drugs as they are often used to control inflammation, inhibit cell division, and modulate the host microenvironment to control the disease. From the top 30 COVID-19 drug candidates, twelve have a role as an antineoplastic agent, seven of which are approved for human use. Altogether, nearly 40% of the drugs identified by our model have been identified by others for COVID-19 clinical trials. Disease biology modeling incorporating disease-associated genes/proteins discussed in the research literature together with known molecular interactions in relevant cell types is a useful method to better understand disease biology and identify potentially effective therapeutic interventions.","Aims To analyze the chronic effects of short-term aerobic and anaerobic physical training on prostate compartments, extracellular matrix, microvascularization, TGF\u03b2, cyclooxygenase-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and macrophage immunostaining, and ventral prostate histopathology in adult rats.","R-loops are three-stranded nucleic acid structures formed from the hybridization of RNA and DNA during transcription. While the pathological consequences of R-loops have been well-studied to date, the locations, classes, and dynamics of physiological R-loops remain poorly understood. R-loop mapping studies provide insight into R-loop dynamics, but their findings are challenging to generalize. This is due to the narrow biological scope of individual studies, the limitations of each mapping modality, and, in some cases, poor data quality. In this study, we reprocessed 693 R-loop mapping datasets from a wide array of biological conditions and mapping modalities. From this data resource, we developed an accurate method for R-loop data quality control, and we reveal the extent of poor-quality data within previously published studies. We then identified a set of high-confidence R-loop mapping samples and used them to define consensus R-loop sites called \u201cR-loop regions\u201d (RL regions). In the process, we revealed the stark divergence between S9.6 and dRNH-based R-loop mapping methods and identified biologically meaningful subtypes of both constitutive and variable R-loops. Taken together, this work provides a much-needed method to assess R-loop data quality and reveals intriguing aspects of R-loop biology.","Cytokine inducible SH2-containing protein (CISH) is a natural killer (NK) cell negative regulator of cytokine signaling pathway. To further understand CISH functions in NK cells, we developed a conditional Cish-deficient mouse model in NK cells (Cishfl/flNcr1Ki/+). We detected no developmental or homeostatic difference in NK cells.","Exploring molecular mechanisms of inbreeding depression is significant for the conservation and sustainable use of the rare breed with a specific trait of high production value. In this work, we conducted whole-transcriptome analysis of two selectively bred Pacific oyster strains with one inbred strain showing significant growth depression. A total of 7980, 2677, and 28 differentially expressed protein-coding genes (DEGs), lncRNAs (DELs), and miRNAs (DEMs) were identified, respectively. The majority of DEGs and predicted target genes of DELs and DEMs were significantly enriched in biological process including immune response, cell proliferation, and apoptosis pathways. A set of genes with specific expression patterns as revealed by cluster profiling and enrichment analysis were identified, which may underlie inbreeding depression of the inbred strain. Furthermore, a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network was constructed by integrative analysis of DEGs, DELs, and DEMs, supporting that ncRNAs, as regulators of gene expression, could be critical modulators in multiple subsystems involved in inbreeding depression.","The extent to which genetic influences on complex traits and disease are mediated by changes in DNA methylation levels has not been systematically explored. We developed an analytical framework that integrates genetic fine mapping and Mendelian randomization with epigenome-wide association studies to evaluate the causal relationships between methylation levels and 14 cardiovascular disease traits.","Mineral amount in bovine muscle affect meat quality, growth, health and reproductive traits in beef cattle. To better understand the genetic basis of this phenotype, we implemented new applications of use for two complementary algorithms: the partial correlation and information theory (PCIT) and the regulatory impact factor (RIF), by including GEBVs as part of the input. We used PCIT to determine putative regulatory relationships based on significant associations between gene expression and mineral amount. Then, RIF was used to determine the regulatory impact of genes and miRNA expression over mineral amount. We also investigated over-represented pathways, as well as evidences from previous studies carried in the same population, to determine regulatory genes for mineral amount e.g. NOX1, whose expression was positively correlated to Zn and was described as regulated by this mineral in humans. With this methodology, we were able to identify genes, miRNAs and pathways not yet described as important for mineral amount. The results support the hypothesis that extracellular matrix interactions are the core regulator of mineral amount in muscle cells. Putative regulators described here add information to this hypothesis, expanding the molecular relationships between gene expression and minerals.","Steroidogenesis is strictly regulated at multiple levels, as produced steroid hormones are crucial to maintain physiological functions. Cytochrome P450 enzymes are key players in adrenal steroid hormone biosynthesis and function within short redox-chains in mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. However, mechanisms regulating supply of reducing equivalents in the mitochondrial CYP-dependent system are not fully understood. In the present work, we aimed to estimate how the specific steroids, substrates, intermediates and products of multistep reactions modulate protein-protein interactions between adrenodoxin (Adx) and mitochondrial CYP11s. Using the SPR technology we determined that steroid substrates affect affinity and stability of CYP11s \u2013 Adx complexes in an isoform-specific mode. In particular, cholesterol induces a 4-fold increase in the rate of CYP11A1 \u2013 Adx complex formation without significant effect on dissociation (koff decreased ~1.5-fold), overall increasing complex affinity. At the same time steroid substrates decrease the affinity of both CYP11B1 \u2013 Adx and CYP11B2 \u2013 Adx complexes, predominantly reducing their stability (4-7 fold). This finding reveals differentiation of protein-protein interactions within the mitochondrial pool of CYPs, which have the same electron donor. The regulation of electron supply by the substrates might affect the overall steroid hormones production. Our experimental data provide further insight into protein-protein interactions within CYP-dependent redox chains involved in steroidogenesis.","Cancer chemotherapy responses have been related to multiple pharmacogenetic biomarkers, often for the same drug. This study utilizes machine learning to derive multi-gene expression signatures that predict individual patient responses to specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including erlotinib, gefitinib, sorafenib, sunitinib, lapatinib and imatinib. Support Vector Machine learning was used to train mathematical models that distinguished sensitivity from resistance to these drugs using a novel systems biology-based approach. This began with expression of genes previously implicated in specific drug responses, then expanded to evaluate genes whose products were related through biochemical pathways and interactions. Optimal pathway-extended support vector machines predicted responses in patients at accuracies of 70% (imatinib), 71% (lapatinib), 83% (sunitinib), 83% (erlotinib), 88% (sorafenib) and 91% (gefitinib). These best performing pathway-extended models demonstrated improved balance predicting both sensitive and resistant patient categories, with many of these genes having a known role in cancer etiology. Ensemble machine learning-based averaging of multiple pathway-extended models derived for an individual drug increased accuracy to &gt;70% for erlotinib, gefitinib, lapatinib, and sorafenib. Through incorporation of novel cancer biomarkers, machine learning-based pathway-extended signatures display strong efficacy predicting both sensitive and resistant patient responses to chemotherapy.","Pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis (PAM) is an autosomal recessive lung disease caused by a deficiency in the pulmonary epithelial Npt2b sodium-phosphate co-transporter that results in accumulation of phosphate and formation of hydroxyapatite microliths in the alveolar space. The single cell transcriptomic analysis of a PAM lung explant showing a robust osteoclast gene signature in alveolar monocytes and the finding that calcium phosphate microliths contain a rich protein and lipid matrix that includes bone resorbing osteoclast enzymes suggested a role for osteoclast-like cells in the defense against microliths. While investigating the mechanisms of microlith clearance, we found that Npt2b modulates pulmonary phosphate homeostasis through effects on alternative phosphate transporter activity and alveolar osteoprotegerin, and that microliths induce osteoclast formation and activity in a receptor activator of nuclear factor-\u03baB ligand (RANKL) and dietary phosphate dependent manner. This work reveals that Npt2b and pulmonary osteoclast-like cells play key roles in pulmonary homeostasis and suggest potential new therapeutic targets for the treatment of lung disease.","Cholesterol 7\u03b1-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1) participates in lipid metabolism of liver, and its pathway involves catabolism of cholesterol to bile acids and excretion from the body. However, little is known about the effect of the polymorphisms of CYP7A1 gene on duck lipid traits. In the present study, seven novel synonymous mutations loci in exon 2 and exon 3 of CYP7A1 gene in Cherry Valley ducks were identified using PCR production direct sequencing. One novel SNP g.1033130 C&gt;T was predicted in exon 2. Six novel SNPs g.1034076 C&gt;T, g.1034334 G&gt;A, g.1034373 G&gt;A, g.1034448 T&gt;C, g.1034541 C&gt;G, and g.1034550 G&gt;A were discovered in exon 3. Six haplotypes were detected using SHEsis online analysis software, and five loci (g.1034334G&gt;A, g.1034373G&gt;A, g.1034448T&gt;C, g.1034541C&gt;G, and g.1034550G&gt;A) were in complete linkage disequilibrium, and as a block named Locus C3. By single SNP association analysis, we found that the g.1033130 C&gt;T locus was significantly associated with IMF, AFP, TG, and TC (P&lt;0.01 or P&lt;0.05) respectively, the g.1034076 C&gt;T locus was significantly associated with AFP (P&lt;0.05), and the locus C3 was significantly associated with TCH (P&lt;0.05). Sixteen dipoltypes were detected by the combination of haplotypes, and demonstrated strong association with IMF, AFP, TG, and TCH (P&lt;0.01). Therefore, our data suggested that the seven SNPs of CYP7A1 gene are potential markers for lipid homeostasis, and may be used for early breeding and selection of duck.","MiR-1 and miR-143 are frequently reduced in human prostate cancer (PCa), while miR-141 and miR-21 are frequently elevated. Consequently, these miRNAs have been studied as cell-autonomous tumor suppressors and oncogenes. However, the cell-type specificity of these miRNAs is not well defined in prostate tissue. Through two different microdissection techniques, and droplet digital RT-PCR, we quantified these miRNAs in the stroma and epithelium of radical prostatectomy specimens. In contrast to their purported roles as cell-autonomous tumor suppressors, we found miR-1 and miR-143 expression to be predominantly stromal. Conversely, miR-141 was predominantly epithelial. MiR-21 was detected in both stroma and epithelium. Strikingly, the levels of miR-1 and miR-143 were significantly reduced in tumor-associated stroma, but not tumor epithelium. Gene expression analyses in human cell lines, tissues, and prostate-derived stromal cultures support the cell-type selective expression of miR-1, miR-141, and miR-143. Analyses of the PCa Genome Atlas (TCGA-PRAD) showed a strong positive correlation between stromal markers and miR-1 and miR-143, and a strong negative correlation between stromal markers and miR-141. In these tumors, loss of miR-1 and gain of miR-21 was highly associated with biochemical recurrence. These data shed new light on stromal and epithelial miRNA expression in the PCa tumor microenvironment.","Metronomic chemotherapy (MET) has been developed to address the shortcomings of maximum-tolerated chemotherapy (MTD) in regard to toxicity and development of resistance mechanisms in the tumor. In colorectal cancer (CRC), MET is a promising novel strategy to treat locally advanced malignancies when used as neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). However, so far there are no preclinical studies to assess the impact of MET NAC in CRC to assess the benefits and challenges of this approach. Here, we used a primary model of CRC (via azoxymethane) to analyze longitudinal changes in angiogenesis in primary tumors under MET and MTD NAC using a combination of diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and mRNA expression (via qPCR). Our results show that MET and MTD NAC lead to increased mean tissue oxygen saturation (8% and 5%, respectively) and oxyhemoglobin (15% and 10%) between weeks 2 and 5 of NAC, and that such increases are caused by distinct molecular signatures in the angiogenic program. Specifically, we find that in the MET group there is a sustained increase in Hif-1a, Aldoa, and Pgk1 expression, suggesting upregulated glycolysis, whereas MTD NAC causes a significant reduction in the expression of the aforementioned genes and of Vegf, leading to vascular remodeling in MTD-treated tumors. Taken together, this study demonstrates the ability of combined optical and molecular methodologies to provide a holistic picture of tumor response to therapy in CRC in a minimally invasive manner.","Background Neural tube defects (NTDs) remain among the most common congenital anomalies. Contributing risk factors include genetics and nutrient deficiencies, however, a comprehensive assessment of nutrient-gene interactions in NTDs is lacking. We hypothesised that multiple nutrient-gene interactions would be evident in NTD-associated gene signatures.","Despite its critical role in neurodevelopment and brain function, vitamin-D (vit-D) homeostasis, metabolism and kinetics within the central nervous system remain largely undetermined. Thus, it is of critical importance to establish an accurate, highly sensitive and reproducible method to quantitate vit-D in brain tissue. Here, we present a novel liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method and for the first time, demonstrate detection of seven major vit-D metabolites in brain tissues of C57BL/6J wild-type mice, namely: 1,25(OH)2D3, 3-epi-1,25(OH)2D3, 1,25(OH)2D2, 25(OH)D3, 25(OH)D2, 24,25(OH)2D3, and 24,25(OH)2D2. Chromatographic separation was achieved on a pentaflurophenyol column 3 mM ammonium formate with water/methanol [A] and methanol/isopropanol [B] phases. Detection was by positive-ion electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. We used calibration standards of each metabolite prepared in brain matrices to validate the detection range, precision, accuracy and recovery. Isotopically labelled analogues, 1,25(OH)2D3-d3, 25(OH)D3-C5 and 24,25(OH)2D3-d6, served as the internal standards for the closest molecular related metabolite in all measurements. The calibration range was between 1 fg/mL to 10 ng/mL with an LLOD and LLOQ of 10 fg/mL and 3 fg/mL, respectively. The intra-/inter-day precision and accuracy for measuring brain vit-D metabolites ranged between 0.12-11.53% and 0.28-9.11%, respectively. Recovery ranged between 99.06% and 106.9% for all metabolites. Collectively, the sensitivity and efficiency of our method supersedes previously reported protocols used to measure vit-D and to our knowledge, the first protocol to reveal the abundance of 25(OH)D2, 1,25(OH)D2 and 24,25(OH)2D2, in brain tissue of any species. This technique may be important in supporting the future advancement of pre-clinical research into the function of vit-D in neurophysiological, neuropsychiatric, and neurodegeneration.","Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is the most common genetic disease in childhood. SMA is generally caused by mutations in SMN1. The Survival of Motor Neurons (SMN) complex consists of SMN1, Gemins (2\u20138) and Strap/Unrip. We previously demonstrated smn1 and gemin5 inhibited tissue regeneration in zebrafish. Here we investigated each individual SMN complex member and identified gemin3 as another regeneration-essential gene. These three genes are likely pan-regenerative since they affect the regeneration of hair cells, liver and caudal fin. RNA-Seq and miRNA-Seq analyses reveal that smn1, gemin3, and gemin5 are linked to a common set of genetic pathways, including the tp53 and ErbB pathways. Additional studies indicated all three genes facilitate regeneration by inhibiting the ErbB pathway, thereby allowing cell proliferation in the injured neuromasts. This study provides a new understanding of the SMN complex and a potential etiology for SMA and potentially other rare unidentified genetic diseases with similar symptoms.","Procedures To assess the relationship between Manganese Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MEMRI) and the expression of calcium receptors in human prostate and breast cancer animal models.","As are most non-European populations around the globe, the Han Chinese are relatively understudied in population and medical genetics studies. From low-coverage whole-genome sequencing of 11,670 Han Chinese women we present a catalog of 25,057,223 variants, including 548,401 novel variants that are seen at least 10 times in our dataset. Individuals from our study come from 19 out of 22 provinces across China, allowing us to study population structure, genetic ancestry, and local adaptation in Han Chinese. We identify previously unrecognized population structure along the East-West axis of China and report unique signals of admixture across geographical space, such as European influences among the Northwestern provinces of China. Finally, we identified a number of highly differentiated loci, indicative of local adaptation in the Han Chinese. In particular, we detected extreme differentiation among the Han Chinese at MTHFR, ADH7, and FADS loci, suggesting that these loci may not be specifically selected in Tibetan and Inuit populations as previously suggested. On the other hand, we find that Neandertal ancestry does not vary significantly across the provinces, consistent with admixture prior to the dispersal of modern Han Chinese. Furthermore, contrary to a previous report, Neandertal ancestry does not explain a significant amount of heritability in depression. Our findings provide the largest genetic data set so far made available for Han Chinese and provide insights into the history and population structure of the world\u2019s largest ethnic group.","Older adults who report more sleep problems tend to have elevated levels of the Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) biomarker \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2), but the mechanisms responsible for this relationship are largely unknown. Molecular markers of sleep problems are now emerging from rodent research, yielding opportunities to generate hypotheses about the causes of the sleep-A\u03b2 relationship. A major molecular marker of sleep deprivation is Homer1a, a neural protein coded by the HOMER1 gene, involved in control of sleep homeostasis and also implied in A\u03b2 accumulation. Here, in a sample of 109 cognitively healthy middle-aged and older adults, we tested whether the relationship between cortical A\u03b2 accumulation and self-reported sleep quality, as well as changes in sleep quality over three years, was stronger in cortical regions with high HOMER1 mRNA expression levels. A\u03b2 correlated with poorer sleep quality cross-sectionally and longitudinally. This relationship was stronger in the younger (50-67 years) than the older (68-81 years) participants. Effects were mainly found in regions with high expression of HOMER1, suggesting a possible molecular pathway between sleep problems and A\u03b2 accumulation. The anatomical distribution of the sleep-A\u03b2 relationships followed closely the A\u03b2 accumulation pattern in 69 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD. Thus, the results indicate that the relationship between sleep problems and A\u03b2-accumulation may involve Homer1 activity in the cortical regions that harbor A\u03b2 in AD. Analysis of cortical gene expression patterns represent a promising avenue to unveil molecular mechanisms behind the relationship between sleep problems and AD risk.","Reducing the foreign body response (FBR) to implanted biomaterials will enhance their in vivo performance in tissue engineering. Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels are increasingly popular for this application due to their low cost and ease of use. PEG hydrogels can elicit chronic inflammation upon implantation, but recent evidence has suggested that extremely hydrophilic, zwitterionic hydrogels can reduce the FBR to particles and gels. To expand on this approach, we synthesized hydrogels of co-monomers PEG and the zwitterion phosphorylcholine (PC) to quantify the combinatorial effects of modulus and hydrophilicity on the FBR. Surprisingly, hydrogels with the highest amount of zwitterionic co-monomer elicited the highest FBR we observed. Lowering the hydrogel modulus (165 kPa to 3 kPa), or PC content (20 wt% to 0 wt%), mitigated this effect. A high density of macrophages was found at the surface of implants associated with a high FBR, and mass spectrometry analysis of the proteins adsorbed to these gels implicated extracellular matrix, immune response, and cell adhesion protein categories as drivers of macrophage recruitment to these hydrogels. Overall, we show that modulus regulates macrophage adhesion to zwitterionic-PEG hydrogels, and demonstrate that chemical modifications to hydrogels should be studied in parallel with their physical properties to optimize implant design.","While the quality of fat (e.g. saturated/unsaturated) and carbohydrate (e.g. whole grain/simple sugars) intake has been of great interest, less attention has been made to the type of protein and resulting amino acid intake profiles in human diets. Studies at the molecular level however demonstrate that dietary amino acid intake produces substantial effects on health and disease such as cancer by modulating metabolism. How these effects may manifest in human food consumption and dietary patterns is unknown. We developed a series of algorithms to map, characterize and model the landscape of amino acid content in human food, dietary patterns, and individual consumption including relations to health status, covering over 2,000 foods, ten dietary patterns, and over 30,000 dietary records. We found that the type of amino acids contained in foods and human consumption is highly dynamic with variability far exceeding that of fat and carbohydrate. Some amino acids positively associate with diseases such as obesity while others contained in the same food negatively link to disease. Using linear programming and machine learning, we show that these health trade-offs among can be accounted to satisfy biochemical constraints in food and human eating patterns to construct a Pareto front in dietary practice, a means of achieving optimality in the face of tradeoffs that are commonly considered in economic and evolutionary theories. Thus this study may enable the design of human protein quality intake guidelines based on a quantitative framework.","Rationale The calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) regulates serum calcium concentrations and common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a carboxyl terminal tri-locus haplotype block contribute to serum calcium variance in the general population. Altered serum calcium concentrations are associated with coronary artery disease (CAD), but direct role for CaSR in CAD remains to be determined.","The vagina contains at least a billion microbial cells, which are dominated by Lactobacilli. Here we perform metagenomic shotgun sequencing on cervical samples from 1148 women. Factors such as pregnancy, delivery histories and breast-feeding were all more important than menstrual cycle in shaping the microbiome. Bifidobacterium breve was seen with older age at sexual debut; Lactobacillus crispatus negatively correlated with pregnancy history; potential markers for lack of menstrual regularity, heavy flow, dysmenorrhea, contraceptives were also identified. Other features such as mood fluctuations and facial speckles could potentially be deduced from the vagino-cervical microbiome. Gut and oral microbiome, plasma vitamins, metals, amino acids and hormones showed associations with the vagino-cervical microbiome. Our results offer an unprecedented glimpse into the microbiota of the female reproductive tract and call for international collaborations to better understand its long-term health impact.","Rationale Non-renal extravasation of phosphate from the circulation and transient accumulation into tissues and extracellular fluid is a regulated process of acute phosphate homeostasis that is not well understood. Following oral consumption of phosphate, circulating levels normalize long before urinary excretion has been completed. This process is especially relevant in the setting of chronic kidney disease (CKD), where phosphate exposure is prolonged due to inefficient kidney excretion. Furthermore, CKD-associated dysregulation of mineral metabolism exacerbates pathological accumulation of phosphate causing vascular calcification (VC).","Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are ectatic capillary-venous malformations that develop in approximately 0.5% of the population. Patients with CCMs may develop headaches, focal neurologic deficits, seizures, and hemorrhages. While symptomatic CCMs, depending upon the anatomic location, can be surgically removed, there is currently no pharmaceutical therapy to treat CCMs. Several mouse models have been developed to better understand CCM pathogenesis and test therapeutics. The most common mouse models induce a large CCM burden that is anatomically restricted to the cerebellum and contributes to lethality in the early days of life. These inducible models thus have a relatively short period for drug administration. We developed an inducible CCM3 mouse model that develops CCMs after weaning and provides a longer period for potential therapeutic intervention. Using this new model, three recently proposed CCM therapies - fasudil, tempol, vitamin D3, and a combination of the three drugs failed to substantially reduce CCM formation when treatment was administered for five weeks, from postnatal day 21 (P21) to P56. We next restricted Ccm3 deletion to the brain vasculature and provided greater time (121 days) for CCMs to develop chronic hemorrhage, recapitulating the human lesions. We also developed the first model of acute CCM hemorrhage by injecting mice harboring CCMs with lipopolysaccharide. These efficient models will enable future drug studies to more precisely target clinically relevant features of CCM disease: CCM formation, chronic hemorrhage, and acute hemorrhage.","Mutations of the adaptor protein-2 sigma subunit (AP2S1) gene which encodes AP2\u03c32, a component of the ubiquitous AP2 heterotetrameric complex involved in endosomal trafficking of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), cause familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia type 3 (FHH3). FHH3 patients have heterozygous AP2S1 missense Arg15 mutations (p.Arg15Cys, p.Arg15His or p.Arg15Leu) with marked hypercalcemia and occasional hypophosphatemia and osteomalacia. To further characterise the phenotypic spectrum and calcitropic pathophysiology of FHH3, we used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to generate mice harboring the AP2S1 p.Arg15Leu mutation, which causes the most severe FHH3 phenotype. Heterozygous (Ap2s1+/L15) mice were viable, and had marked hypercalcemia, hypermagnesemia, hypophosphatemia, and increased plasma concentrations of parathyroid hormone, fibroblast growth factor 23 and alkaline phosphatase activity, but normal pro-collagen type 1 N-terminal pro-peptide and 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D. Homozygous (Ap2s1L15/L15) mice invariably died perinatally. The AP2S1 p.Arg15Leu mutation impaired protein-protein interactions between AP2\u03c32 and the other AP2 subunits, and the CaSR. Cinacalcet, a CaSR allosteric activator, ameliorated the hypercalcemia and elevated PTH concentrations, but not the diminished AP2\u03c32-CaSR interaction. Thus, our studies have established a mouse model with a germline loss-of-function AP2S1 mutation that is representative for FHH3 in humans, and demonstrated that cinacalcet corrects the abnormalities of plasma calcium and PTH.","The importance of extracellular gradients of biomolecules becomes increasingly appreciated in the processes of tissue development and regeneration, in health and disease. In particular, dynamics of extracellular calcium concentration is rarely studied. Here, we present low affinity Ca2+ biosensor based on Twitch-2B fluorescent protein fused with the cellulose- and collagen-binding peptides. These recombinant chimeric proteins can bind cellulose and collagen scaffolds and enable for scaffold-based biosensing of Ca2+ in proximity of live 3D tissue models. We found that the Twitch-2B mutant is compatible with intensity-based ratiometric and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) measurement formats, under one- and two-photon excitation modes. Furthermore, the donor fluorescence lifetime of ColBD-Twitch displays response to [Ca2+] over a range of \u223c2-2.5 ns, making it attractive biosensor for multiplexed FLIM microscopy assays. To evaluate performance of this biosensor in physiological measurements, we applied ColBD-Twitch to the live Lgr5-GFP mouse intestinal organoid culture and measured its responses to the changes in extracellular Ca2+ upon chelation with EGTA. When we combined it with spectrally resolved FLIM of lipid droplets using Nile Red dye, we observed changes in cytoplasmic and basal membrane-associated lipid droplet composition in response to the extracellular Ca2+ depletion, suggesting that intestinal epithelium can respond to and compensate such treatment. Altogether, our results demonstrate ColBD-Twitch as a prospective Ca2+ sensor for multiplexed FLIM analysis in a complex 3D tissue environment.","Non-coding genetic variants in the CLEC16A gene on human chromosome 16p13.13 are associated with risk of autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis. In this region, we previously identified DEXI, a candidate causal gene of unknown function, which alters the risk of type 1 diabetes, where the T1D predisposing allele is associated with lower DEXI expression. Here, we demonstrate by CRISPR mutagenesis in vivo and deep phenotyping that disrupted Dexi expression accelerates diabetes in the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse, a spontaneous model of autoimmune pancreatic beta-cell destruction. Mutant mice have increased serum IgM and IgA concentrations compared to wild-type NOD mice, as well as changes in both the gut microbiome and molecular metabolites associated with microbial metabolism. These findings suggest that the mechanism by which DEXI alters diabetes risk involves the composition and function of the microbiome and its impact on host metabolites. Such metabolites, including short chain fatty acids such as butyrate, have been shown to alter the activity of the immune cells involved in beta-cell destruction and susceptibility of the beta cells to autoimmune attack.","While the genetic suppressor screen is efficient in suggesting therapeutic genes, this strategy has yet to be successful for cardiomyopathies in vertebrates. To develop such a strategy, we recently established a mutagenesis screen platform in zebrafish for systematic discovery of genetic modifiers of doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy (DIC). Here, we further revealed both molecular and cellular insights of the first salutary modifier emerged from the screen, i.e. gene-breaking transposon (GBT) 0419 that affects the retinoid X receptor alpha a (rxraa) gene. First, by rescuing the mutation in tissue-specific manner with multiple Cre-loxP systems, we demonstrated that the endothelial, but not myocardial or epicardial, function of rxraa is primary to this cardioprotective effects. Next, we showed that the rxraa-associated salutary effects on DIC were conferred partially by the activation of retinoid acid (RA) signaling. Finally, we identified isotretinoin and bexarotene, 2 US Food and Drug Administration-approved RXRA agonists that are effective in treating adult zebrafish DIC when administered during the early, but not the late, phase of DIC progression. Collectively, we provided the first in vivo genetic evidence in supporting RXRA as the therapeutic target for DIC, and uncovered a previously unrecognized spatiotemporally-restricted mechanism for this gene-based therapeutic strategy. Our study also justified that searching salutary modifiers via zebrafish mutagenesis screen can be effective in discovering new therapeutic targets for cardiomyopathies.","Translation of mRNA into a polypeptide is terminated when the release factor eRF1 recognizes a UAA, UAG, or UGA stop codon in the ribosomal A site and stimulates nascent peptide release. However, stop codon readthrough can occur when a near-cognate tRNA outcompetes eRF1 in decoding the stop codon, resulting in the continuation of the elongation phase of protein synthesis. At the end of a conventional mRNA coding region, readthrough allows translation into the mRNA 3\u2019-UTR. Previous studies with reporter systems have shown that the efficiency of termination or readthrough is modulated by cis-acting elements other than stop codon identity, including two nucleotides 5\u2019 of the stop codon, six nucleotides 3\u2019 of the stop codon in the ribosomal mRNA channel, and stem-loop structures in the mRNA 3\u2019-UTR. It is unknown whether these elements are important at a genome-wide level and whether other mRNA features proximal to the stop codon significantly affect termination and readthrough efficiencies in vivo. Accordingly, we carried out ribosome profiling analyses of yeast cells expressing wild-type or temperature-sensitive eRF1 and developed bioinformatics strategies to calculate readthrough efficiency, and to identify mRNA and peptide features which influence that efficiency. We found that the stop codon (nt +1 to +3), the nucleotide after it (nt +4), the codon in the P site (nt -3 to -1), and 3\u2019-UTR length are the most influential features in the control of readthrough efficiency, while nts +5 to +9 and mRNA secondary structure in the 3\u2019-UTR had milder effects. Additionally, we found low readthrough genes to have shorter 3\u2019-UTRs compared to high readthrough genes in cells with thermally inactivated eRF1, while this trend was reversed in wild-type cells. Together, our results demonstrated the general roles of known regulatory elements in genome-wide regulation and identified several new mRNA or peptide features affecting the efficiency of translation termination and readthrough.","Backgrounds and aims: Transfer RNA (tRNA) is the most extensively modified RNA in cells. Queuosine (Q)-modification is a fundamental process for fidelity and efficiency of translation from RNA to proteins. In eukaryotes, tRNA-Q-modification relies on the intestinal microbial product queuine. However, the roles and potential mechanisms of Q-tRNA modifications in IBD are unknown. Methods: We explored the Q-tRNA modifications and expression of Q tRNA ribosyltransferase catalytic subunit 1 (QTRT1) in patients with IBD by investigating human biopsies and reanalyzing datasets. We used colitis models, organoids, and cultured cells for loss- and gain-of-function studies to investigate the molecular mechanisms of Q-tRNA modifications in the intestinal inflammation. Results: QTRT1 expression was significantly downregulated in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease patients. The four Q-tRNA-related tRNA synthetases (asparaginyl-, aspartyl-, histidyl-, and tyrosyl- tRNA synthetase) were decreased in IBD patients. This reduction was further confirmed in DSS-induced colitis and IL10-deficient mice. Reduced QTRT1 was significantly correlated with cell proliferation and intestinal junctions, including downregulated beta-catenin and Claudin-5 and upregulated Claudin-2. These alterations were confirmed in vitro by deleting QTRT1 from cells. Queuine treatment significantly enhanced cell proliferation and junction functions in cell lines and human colonoids. Queuine treatment also reduced inflammation in epithelial cells. Moreover, altered QTRT1-related metabolites were found in human IBD. Conclusion: tRNA modifications play an unexplored novel role in the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation by altering epithelial proliferation and junctions. Investigations on tRNA modification will uncover novel molecular mechanisms for potential prevention and therapy for IBD.","Mycobacterium tuberculosis when phagocytosed by macrophages is not cleared completely and many of the bacteria remain in phagosomes indefinitely. In this study we considered abnormal retention of filamentous actin on early phagosomes contributing to defective phagosome acidification. Phosphocofilin1, the inactive form of actin depolymerizing protein cofilin1, which leads to retention of filamentous actin, and the total filamentous actin itself were found upregulated in macrophages infected with virulent M. tuberculosis. Over expression of constitutively active cofilin1 in macrophages was found to increase phagosome acidification when infected with virulent M. tuberculosis. The anticancer drug sorafenib which activates cofilin1 in PI3K dependent manner was also found to increase phagosome acidification. Cofilin1, known to be positively regulated by superoxide was found to be downregulated by ESAT-6 of M. tuberculosis where the latter is known to reduce ROS in macrophages. Ectopic expression of ESAT-6 in macrophages was found to increase filamentous actin and to transform the macrophages more spindle shaped. ESAT-6 was also found to decrease phagosome acidification in macrophages infected with an avirulent M. tuberculosis strain. Finally, this study proposes a role for the amino acid methionine in resisting ROS by creating M93 mutants of ESAT-6.","","Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) differentiate from hemogenic endothelial (HE) cells through an endothelial to hematopoietic cell transition (EHT). Newly formed HSPCs accumulate in intra-arterial clusters (IACs) before colonizing the fetal liver. To examine the cell and molecular transitions during the EHT, and the heterogeneity of HSPCs within IACs, we profiled \u223c37,000 cells from the caudal arteries of embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5) to E11.5 mouse embryos by single-cell transcriptome and chromatin accessibility sequencing. We identified an intermediate developmental stage prior to HE that we termed pre-HE, characterized by increased accessibility of chromatin enriched for SOX, FOX, GATA, and SMAD motifs. A developmental bottleneck separates pre-HE from HE, with RUNX1 dosage regulating the efficiency of the pre-HE to HE transition. Distinct developmental trajectories within IAC cells result in two populations of CD45+ HSPCs; an initial wave of lympho-myeloid-biased progenitors, followed by precursors of hematopoietic stem cells (pre-HSCs).","The role of individual factors in the progressing of degenerative and dystrophic changes of articular cartilage as the focus of pathologic changes in posttraumatic osteoarthrosis (PTOA) has been studied comprehensively. However, no single concept of pathogenetic mechanisms leading to the formation of permanent changes in the affected joint has been represented yet. Therefore, the investigation of lipid peroxidation and skeletal tissues metabolism in animals with simulated PTOA is a challenging and important issue.","Transcriptional phenotypic drug discovery has achieved great success, and various compound perturbation-based data resources, such as Connectivity Map (CMap) and Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS), have been presented. Computational strategies fully mining these resources for phenotypic drug discovery have been proposed, and among them, a fundamental issue is to define the proper similarity between the transcriptional profiles to elucidate the drug mechanism of actions and identify new drug indications. Traditionally, this similarity has been defined in an unsupervised way, and due to the high dimensionality and the existence of high noise in those high-throughput data, it lacks robustness with limited performance. In our study, we present Dr. Sim, which is a general learning-based framework that automatically infers similarity measurement rather than being manually designed and can be used to characterize transcriptional phenotypic profiles for drug discovery with generalized good performance. We evaluated Dr. Sim on comprehensively publicly available in vitro and in vivo datasets in drug annotation and repositioning using high-throughput transcriptional perturbation data and indicated that Dr. Sim significantly outperforms the existing methods and is proved to be a conceptual improvement by learning transcriptional similarity to facilitate the broad utility of high-throughput transcriptional perturbation data for phenotypic drug discovery. The source code and usage of Dr. Sim is available at https://github.com/bm2-lab/DrSim/.","Although Barrett\u2019s metaplasia of the esophagus (BE) is the only known precursor lesion to esophageal adenocarcinomas (EACs), drivers of the metaplasia\u2192dysplasia\u2192neoplasia cascade in the esophagus remains incompletely understood. Using an AI-guided network transcriptomics approach, in which EAC initiation and progression is modeled as networks to simplify complex multi-cellular processes, we first predict cellular continuum states and disease driving processes with an unprecedented degree of precision. Key AI-guided predictions are subsequently validated in a human organoid model and patient-derived biopsies of BE, a case-control study of genomics of BE progression, and in a cross-sectional study of 113 patients with BE and EACs. We find that all EACs must originate from BE, pinpoint a CXCL8/IL8\u2194neutrophil immune microenvironment as a driver of cellular transformation in both EACs and gastroesophageal junction-ACs. This driver is prominent in Caucasians (Cau), but notably absent in African Americans (AAs). Network-derived gene signatures, independent signatures of neutrophil processes, CXCL8/IL8, and an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) are associated with risk of progression. SNPs associated with ethnic changes in ANC modify that risk. Thus, findings define a racially influenced immunological basis for cell transformation and suggest that benign ethnic neutropenia in AAs may serve as a deterrent to BE\u2192EAC progression.","Defects in innate immunity affect many different physiologic systems and several studies of patients with primary immunodeficiency disorders demonstrated the importance of innate immune system components in disease prevention or colonization of bacterial pathogens. To assess the role of the innate immune system on nasal colonization with Staphylococcus aureus, innate immune responses in pediatric S. aureus nasal persistent carriers (n=15) and non-carriers (n=15) were profiled by analyzing co-clustered gene sets (modules) identified through large-scale transcriptome data analysis as the basis for the development of a targeted assay. We stimulated previously frozen peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from these subjects with i) a panel of TLR ligands, ii) live S. aureus (either a mixture of strains or stimulation with respective carriage isolates), or iii) heat-killed S. aureus. We found no difference in responses between carriers and non-carriers when PBMCs were stimulated with a panel of TLR ligands. However, PBMCs stimulated with live S. aureus elicited a significantly different response that also differed from the response elicited following stimulation with dead S. aureus. Furthermore, we observed a distinct stimulation profile for PBMCs isolated from persistent carriers stimulated with their respective live or dead carriage strains compared to responses observed for PBMCs isolated from non-carriers that were similar regardless of whether or not the bacteria were alive or not. These data suggested that innate pathway signaling is different between persistent and non-carriers of S. aureus.","Background/Objective Tight junctions (TJs) are essential for barrier integrity, inflammation, and cancer. The TJ protein Claudin-5 in the epithelia forms paracellular barriers and pores for permeability. Vitamin D and the vitamin D receptor (VDR) play important roles in various cancers. Although VDR and Claudin-5 are all involved in colorectal cancer (CRC), it remains unclear if they are closely related or function independently.","Bile acids play crucial roles in host physiology by acting as both detergents that aid in digestion and as signaling molecules that bind to host receptors. Gut bacterial bile salt hydrolase (BSH) enzymes perform the gateway reaction leading to the conversion of host-produced primary bile acids into bacterially modified secondary bile acids. Small molecule probes that target BSHs will help elucidate the causal roles of these metabolites in host physiology. We previously reported the development of a covalent BSH inhibitor with low gut permeability. Here, we build on our previous findings and describe the development of a second-generation gut-restricted BSH inhibitor with enhanced potency, reduced off-target effects, and durable in vivo efficacy. SAR studies focused on the bile acid core identified a compound, AAA-10, containing a C3-sulfonated lithocholic acid scaffold and an alpha-fluoromethyl ketone warhead as a potent pan-BSH inhibitor. This compound inhibits BSH activity in conventional mouse fecal slurries, bacterial cultures, and purified BSH proteins and displays reduced toxicity against mammalian cells compared to first generation compounds. Oral administration of AAA-10 to wild-type mice for 5 days resulted in a decrease in the abundance of the secondary bile acids deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA) in the mouse GI tract with low systemic exposure of AAA-10, demonstrating that AAA-10 is an effective tool for inhibiting BSH activity and modulating bile acid pool composition in vivo.","Self-recognition is the ability to recognise stimuli originating from oneself. Humans and most great apes show evidence of true self-recognition in the mirror test. They use their reflection to remove a mark that is only visible in the mirror. Not all animals, however, rely primarily on vision. In lizards, chemical cues are important in social interactions. A number of lizard species show chemical self-recognition but it has never been investigated in a gecko species. Here, we test the tokay gecko (Gekko gecko) a territorial species with parental care on their ability to discriminate their own skin and faecal chemicals from those of same-sex, unfamiliar conspecifics. Geckos show a higher response rate towards chemicals from unfamiliar individuals compared to self-produced chemicals and a water control. Lizards showed self-directed behaviour, responded stronger to skin chemicals and females responded more than males. Our study provides first evidence towards self-recognition and for a social function of chemical present on faeces in tokay geckos but further tests are needed to confirm true self-recognition. Tokay geckos are an excellent model species to investigate individual recognition to demonstrate more sophisticated social cognitive abilities than have previously been attributed to reptiles.","Female mammals are functional mosaics of their parental X-linked gene expression due to X chromosome inactivation (XCI). This process inactivates one copy of the X chromosome in each cell during embryogenesis and that state is maintained clonally through mitosis. In mice, the choice of which parental X chromosome remains active is determined by the X chromosome controlling element (Xce), which has been mapped to a 176 kb candidate interval. A series of functional Xce alleles has been characterized or inferred for classical inbred strains based on biased, or skewed, inactivation of the parental X chromosomes in crosses between strains. To further explore the function-structure basis and location of the Xce, we measured allele-specific expression of X-linked genes in a large population of F1 females generated from Collaborative Cross strains. Using published sequence data and applying a Bayesian \u201cP\u00f3lya urn\u201d model of XCI skew, we report two major findings. First, inter-individual variability in XCI suggests mouse epiblasts contain on average 20-30 cells contributing to brain. Second, NOD/ShiLtJ has a novel and unique functional allele, Xcef, that is the weakest in the Xce allelic series. Despite phylogenetic analysis confirming that NOD/ShiLtJ carries a haplotype almost identical to the well-characterized C57BL/6J (Xceb), we observed unexpected patterns of XCI skewing in females carrying the NOD/ShiLtJ haplotype within the Xce. Copy number variation is common at the Xce locus and we conclude that the observed allelic series is a product of independent and recurring duplications shared between weak Xce alleles.","One of the main functions of alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M) in human blood serum is the binding of all classes of protease. It is known that trypsin, after such interaction, possesses modified proteolytic activity. Trypsin first hydrolyzes two bonds in A2M\u2019s \u2018bait region\u2019, and the peptide 705VGFYESDVMGR715 is released from A2M. In this work, specifics of the A2M-trypsin interaction were used to determine A2M concentration directly in human blood serum using MALDI mass-spectrometry. Following exogenous addition of trypsin to human blood serum in vitro, the concentration of the VGFYESDVMGR peptide was measured, using its isotopically-labeled analogue (18O), and A2M concentration was calculated. The optimized mass spectrometric approach was verified using a standard method for A2M concentration determination (ELISA) and the relevant statistical analysis methods. It was also shown that trypsin\u2019s modified proteolytic activity in the presence of serum A2M can be used to analyze other serum proteins, including potential biomarkers of pathological processes. Thus, this work describes a promising approach to serum biomarker analysis that can be technically extended in several useful directions.","The Shumiya cataract rat (SCR) is a model for hereditary cataract. Two-third of these rats develop lens opacity within 10-11-weeks. Onset of cataract is attributed to the synergetic effect of lanosterol synthase (Lss) and farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase 1 (Fdft1) mutant alleles that lead to cholesterol deficiency in the lenses, which in turn adversely affects lens biology including the growth and differentiation of lens epithelial cells (LECs). Nevertheless, the molecular events and changes in gene expression associated with the onset of lens opacity in SCR is poorly understood. In the present study, a microarray-based approach was employed to analyze comparative gene expression changes in LECs isolated from the pre-cataractous and cataractous stages of lenses of 5-, 8- and 10-week-old SCRs. The changes in gene expression observed in microarray results in the LECs were further validated using real-time PCR and western blot analyses. Lens opacity was not observed in 5-week-old rats. However, histological analysis revealed mild dysplasia in the anterior suture and poorly differentiated fiber cells at the bow region. Expression of approximately 100 genes, including major intrinsic protein of lens fiber (MIP and Aquaporin0), deoxyribonuclease II beta (Dnase2b), heat shock protein B1 (Hspb1), and crystallin \u03b3 (\u03b3Cry) B, C, and F were found to be significantly downregulated (0.07-0.5 fold) in rat LECs derived from cataract lenses compared to that in noncataractous lenses (control). Thus, our study aimed to identify the gene expression patterns during cataract formation in SCRs, which may be responsible for cataractogenesis in SCR. We proposed that mutation in lanosterol synthase was responsible for the downregulation of genes associated with lens fiber differentiation, which in turn leads to the formation of cataract in these rats. Our findings may have wider implications in understanding the effect of cholesterol deficiency and the role of cholesterol-lowering therapeutics on cataractogenesis.","Vitamin D deficiency is a major environmental risk factor for the development of multiple sclerosis (MS). The major circulating metabolite of vitamin D (25OHD) is converted to the active form (calcitriol) by the hydroxylase enzyme CYP27B1. In MS lesions the tyrosine kinase MerTK expressed by microglia and macrophages regulates phagocytosis of myelin debris and apoptotic cells that can accumulate and inhibit tissue repair and remyelination. We show that calcitriol downregulates MerTK mRNA and protein expression in adult human microglia and monocyte-derived macrophages, thereby inhibiting myelin phagocytosis and apoptotic cell clearance. Proinflammatory myeloid cells express high levels of CYP27B1 compared to homeostatic (TGF\u03b2-treated) myeloid cells. Only proinflammatory cells in the presence of TNF-\u03b1 generate calcitriol from 25OHD, resulting in repression of MerTK expression and function. The selective production of calcitriol in proinflammatory myeloid cells leading to downregulation of MerTK-mediated phagocytosis has the potential to reduce the risk for auto-antigen presentation while retaining the phagocytic ability of homeostatic myeloid cells, thereby contributing to inflammation reduction and enhanced tissue repair.","Purpose Dysregulation of systemic calcium homeostasis during malignancy is common in most patients with high grade tumors. However, it remains unclear whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that alter the sensitivity of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) to circulating calcium are associated with primary and/or secondary neoplasms at specific pathological sites in patients of European and African ancestry.","Mushrooms are versatile materials with applications including but not limited to food, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical industries. In this work, the potential of the common button mushroom, Agaricus bisporus, as a protective agent against ultraviolet exposure was assessed. The assessment was done by investigating the radical scavenging activity, sun protecting capability, and tyrosinase inhibiting properties of Agaricus bisporus ethanolic extract. The extraction was carried out using absolute ethanol as its solvent at low to room temperatures. The bioactive components of the ethanolic extract were analysed for its phenolic and flavonoid contents quantitatively, while other phytochemical agents were analysed qualitatively. The Agaricus bisporus ethanolic extract was found exhibit varying degree of activity in all of the assessment. We found low radical scavenging ability with %RSA IC50 of \u223c5456 \u03bcg/mL, low to moderate sun protecting factor of \u223c5.355 at 5000 ppm concentration, and high tyrosinase inhibition property with IC50 of \u223c2 \u03bcg/mL. The high tyrosinase inhibition property was found to correlate with relatively high total phenolic content of \u223c1143 mg GAE/100g for Agaricus bisporus and the presence of terpenoid in the ethanolic extract.","Telomeres shorten in replicating somatic cells, and telomere length (TL) is associated with age-related diseases 1,2. To date, 17 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 25 loci for leukocyte TL 3\u201319, but were limited to European and Asian ancestry individuals and relied on laboratory assays of TL. In this study from the NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program, we used whole genome sequencing (WGS) of whole blood for variant genotype calling and the bioinformatic estimation of TL in n=109,122 trans-ethnic (European, African, Asian and Hispanic/Latino) individuals. We identified 59 sentinel variants (p-value &lt;5\u00d710\u22129) from 36 loci (20 novel, 13 replicated in external datasets). There was little evidence of effect heterogeneity across populations, and 10 loci had &gt;1 independent signal. Fine-mapping at OBFC1 indicated the independent signals colocalized with cell-type specific eQTLs for OBFC1 (STN1). We further identified two novel genes, DCLRE1B (SNM1B) and PARN, using a multi-variant gene-based approach.","Osteoporosis is a devastating disease with an essential genetic component. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have discovered genetic variants robustly associated with bone mineral density (BMD), however they only report genomic signals and not necessarily the precise localization of culprit effector genes. Therefore, we sought to carry out physical and direct \u2018variant to gene mapping\u2019 in a relevant primary human cell type. We developed \u2018SPATIaL-seq\u2019 (genome-Scale, Promoter-focused Analysis of chromaTIn Looping), a massively parallel, high resolution Capture-C based method to simultaneously characterize the genome-wide interactions of all human promoters. By intersecting our SPATIaL-seq and ATAC-seq data from human mesenchymal progenitor cell -derived osteoblasts, we observed consistent contacts between candidate causal variants and putative target gene promoters in open chromatin for ~30% of the 110 BMD loci investigated. Knockdown of two novel implicated genes, ING3 at \u2018CPED1-WNT16\u2019 and EPDR1 at \u2018STARD3NL\u2019, had pronounced inhibitory effects on osteoblastogenesis. Our approach therefore aids target discovery in osteoporosis and can be applied to other common genetic diseases.","Genetic risk scores (GRSs) are weighted sums of risk allele counts of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with a disease or trait. Construction of GRSs is typically based on published results from Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWASs), the majority of which have been performed in large populations of European ancestry (EA) individuals. While many genotype-trait associations have been shown to generalize from EA populations to other populations, such as Hispanics/Latinos, the optimal choice of SNPs and weights for GRSs may differ between populations due to different linkage disequilibrium (LD) and allele frequency patterns. This is further complicated by the fact that different Hispanic/Latino populations may have different admixture patterns, so that LD and allele frequency patterns may not be the same among non-EA populations. Here, we compare various approaches for GRS construction, using GWAS results from both large EA studies and a smaller study in Hispanics/Latinos, the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL, n = 12, 803). We consider multiple ways to select SNPs from association regions and to calculate the SNP weights. We study the performance of the resulting GRSs in an independent study of Hispanics/Latinos from the Woman Health Initiative (WHI, n = 3, 582). We support our investigation with simulation studies of potential genetic architectures in a single locus. We observed that selecting variants based on EA GWASs generally performs well, as long as SNP weights are calculated using Hispanics/Latinos GWASs, or using the meta-analysis of EA and Hispanics/Latinos GWASs. The optimal approach depends on the genetic architecture of the trait.","Osteoporosis, the most common bone disease, is characterized by a low bone mass and increased risk of fractures. Importantly, individuals with the same bone mineral density (BMD), as measured on two dimensional (2D) radiographs, have different risks for fracture, suggesting that microstructural architecture is an important determinant of skeletal strength. Here we took advantage of the rich phenotypic and genetic diversity of the Collaborative Cross (CC) mice. Using microcomputed tomography, we examined key structural parameters in the femoral cortical and trabecular compartments of male and female mice from 34 CC lines. These traits included the trabecular bone volume fraction, number, thickness, connectivity, and spacing, as well as structural morphometric index. In the mid-diaphyseal cortex, we recorded cortical thickness and volumetric BMD.","Background Cardiometabolic affections greatly contribute to the global burden of disease. The susceptibility to these conditions associates with the ancestral genetic composition and gut microbiota. However, studies explicitly testing associations between genetic ancestry and gut microbes are rare. We examined whether the ancestral genetic composition was associated with gut microbiota, and split apart the effects of genetic and non-genetic factors on host health.","The objective of this study was to investigate effects of feeding-rearing programs that aim for first calving at 20-27 months (mo) of age on growth, reproduction and production performance of Holstein cows at nulliparous and primiparous stages. We hypothesised that, in a seasonal autumn-calving strategy, heifers born late in the season could catch up to the growth of heifers born earlier and be inseminated during the same period, at a body weight (BW) of at least 370 kg. This approach would result in first calving age at 21-22 mo of age without impairing their later performance. To test this hypothesis, we studied 217 heifers over 3 years. They were split into three treatment groups: control feeding (SD), an intensive-plane diet (ID1) from birth to 6 mo of age or an intensive-plane diet from birth to one year of age. Heifers in groups SD and ID1 were born from September until the end of November, while those in ID2 were born later. The present study showed that late-born heifers (ID2) could catch up with the growth of the others due to the feeding treatment, although they were still 42 kg lighter than the SD and ID1 heifers at first calving. No difference in reproductive performance was observed among groups. Once primiparous, the cows reared with the ID2 treatment tended to produce less milk than SD and ID1 cows (ca. 400 kg less on a 305 d basis throughout lactation), and no differences in milk composition, feed intake, body condition score or BW were observed among groups. Age at first service (AFS) was classified a posteriori into three classes: 12.5 (AFS12.5), 14.0 (AFS14.0) and 15.5 mo (AFS15.5) of age. Heifers in AFS12.5 grew faster than those in AFS14.0 and AFS15.5. Once primiparous, the AFS12.5 cows tended to produce less milk at peak than AFS14.0 and AFS15.5 cows (ca. 1.5 kg/d less) although no difference in total milk yield during lactation was observed. No differences in milk composition, feed intake, body condition score or BW were observed among groups. These results support the conclusion that the feeding treatment can enable late-born heifers to catch up to the growth of heifers born earlier in the season. This strategy results in an earlier first calving that does not impair their reproductive performance but does decrease milk yield slightly during first lactation. Future studies should investigate long-term effects of this strategy.","The A2 adenosine receptors play an important role, among others, in the regulation of inflammatory process and glucose homeostasis in diabetes and obesity. Thus, the presented project evaluated of influence of the selective antagonist of A2A adenosine receptor \u2013 KD-64 as compared to the known non-selective antagonist \u2013 caffeine on these two particular processes. Two different inflammation models were induced namely local and systemic inflammation. Obesity was induced in mice by high-fat diet and the tested compounds (KD-64 and caffeine) were administrated for 21 days. KD-64 showed anti-inflammatory effect in both tested inflammation models and administered at the same dose as ketoprofen exerted stronger effect than this reference compound. Elevated levels of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 observed in obese control mice were significantly lowered by the administration of KD-64 and were similar to the values observed in control non-obese mice. Interestingly, caffeine increased the levels of these parameters. In contrast to caffeine which had no influence on AlaT activity, KD-64 administration significantly lowered AlaT activity in the obese mice. Although, contrary to caffeine, KD-64 did not reduce diet-induced obesity in mice, it improved glucose tolerance. Thus, the activity of the selective adenosine A2A receptor antagonist was quite different from that of the non-selective.","Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CURE\u2019s) are emerging as a means to engage large numbers of undergraduate students in meaningful inquiry-based research activities. We describe here a simple laboratory exercise as part of an undergraduate genetics course that illustrates the contributions of oncogenes and tumor suppressors to the formation of neoplasms in an invertebrate model system. In addition, students were challenged to investigate whether flies reared on a diet containing a variety of additives display a higher number of invasive tumors in the larval abdomen.","Understanding human genetic influences on the gut microbiota helps elucidate the mechanisms by which genetics affects health outcomes. We propose a novel approach, the covariate-adjusted kernel RV (KRV) framework, to map genetic variants associated with microbiome beta-diversity, which focuses on overall shifts in the microbiota. The proposed KRV framework improves statistical power by capturing intrinsic structure within the genetic and microbiome data while reducing the multiple-testing burden. We apply the covariate-adjusted KRV test to the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos in a genome-wide association analysis (first gene-level, then variant-level) for microbiome beta-diversity. We have identified an immunity-related gene, IL23R, reported in previous association studies and discovered 3 other novel genes, 2 of which are involved in immune functions or autoimmune disorders. Our findings highlight the value of the KRV as a powerful microbiome GWAS approach and support an important role of immunity-related genes in shaping the gut microbiome composition.","Nuclear receptors are ligand-activated transcription factors that modulate gene regulatory networks from embryonic development to adult physiology and thus represent major targets for clinical interventions in many diseases. Most nuclear receptors function either as homodimers or as heterodimers. The dimerization is crucial for gene regulation by nuclear receptors, by extending the repertoire of binding sites in the promoters or the enhancers of target genes via combinatorial interactions. Here, we focused our attention on an unusual structural variation of the \u03b1-helix, called \u03c0-turn that is present in helix H7 of the ligand-binding domain of RXR and HNF4. By tracing back the complex evolutionary history of the \u03c0-turn, we demonstrate that it was present ancestrally and then independently lost in several nuclear receptor lineages. Importantly, the evolutionary history of the \u03c0-turn motif is parallel to the evolutionary diversification of the nuclear receptor dimerization ability from ancestral homodimers to derived heterodimers. We then carried out structural and biophysical analyses, in particular through point mutation studies of key RXR signature residues and showed that this motif plays a critical role in the network of interactions stabilizing homodimers. We further showed that the \u03c0-turn was instrumental in allowing a flexible heterodimeric interface of RXR in order to accommodate multiple interfaces with numerous partners and critical for the emergence of high affinity receptors. Altogether, our work allows to identify a functional role for the \u03c0-turn in oligomerization of nuclear receptors and reveals how this motif is linked to the emergence of a critical biological function. We conclude that the \u03c0-turn can be viewed as a structural exaptation that has contributed to enlarging the functional repertoire of nuclear receptors.","Mendelian randomization (MR) is widely used to identify causal relationships among heritable traits, but it can be confounded by genetic correlations reflecting shared etiology. We propose a model in which a latent causal variable mediates the genetic correlation between two traits. Under the latent causal variable (LCV) model, trait 1 is fully genetically causal for trait 2 if it is perfectly genetically correlated with the latent causal variable, implying that the entire genetic component of trait 1 is causal for trait 2; it is partially genetically causal for trait 2 if it has a high genetic correlation with the latent variable, implying that part of the genetic component of trait 1 is causal for trait 2. To quantify the degree of partial genetic causality, we define the genetic causality proportion (gcp). We fit this model using mixed fourth moments E(\u03b11\u03b12) and E(\u03b11\u03b12) of marginal effect sizes for each trait, exploiting the fact that if trait 1 is causal for trait 2 then SNPs affecting trait 1 (large ) will have correlated effects on trait 2 (large \u03b11\u03b12), but not vice versa. We performed simulations under a wide range of genetic architectures and determined that LCV, unlike state-of-the-art MR methods, produced well-calibrated false positive rates and reliable gcp estimates in the presence of genetic correlations and asymmetric genetic architectures; we also determined that LCV is well-powered to detect a causal effect. We applied LCV to GWAS summary statistics for 52 traits (average N=331k), identifying partially or fully genetically causal effects (1% FDR) for 59 pairs of traits, including 30 pairs of traits with high gcp estimates (g\u0109p &gt; 0.6). Results consistent with the published literature included genetically causal effects on myocardial infarction (MI) for LDL, triglycerides and BMI. Novel findings included a genetically causal effect of LDL on bone mineral density, consistent with clinical trials of statins in osteoporosis. These results demonstrate that it is possible to distinguish between genetic correlation and causation using genetic data.","The molecular mechanisms that regulate fusion of monocytes into functional osteoclasts are virtually unknown. We describe a knock-in mouse model for the R51Q mutation in sorting nexin 10 (SNX10) that exhibits osteopetrosis and related symptoms of patients of autosomal recessive osteopetrosis linked to this mutation. Osteopetrosis arises in homozygous R51Q SNX10 mice due to a unique combination of reduced numbers of osteoclasts that are non-functional. Fusion of mutant monocytes is deregulated and occurs rapidly and continuously to form giant, non-functional osteoclasts. Mutant osteoclasts mature quickly and survive poorly in vitro, possibly accounting for their scarcity in vivo. These cells also exhibit impaired ruffled borders, which are required for bone resorption, providing an additional basis for the osteopetrotic phenotype. More broadly, we propose that the maximal size of osteoclasts is actively determined by a genetically-regulated, cell-autonomous mechanism that limits precursor cell fusion, and for which SNX10 is required.","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a group of severe respiratory diseases. Identifying COPD through early urinary biomarkers by proteomics technology may help to reduce the mortality rate of the disease, improve the quality of life of patients and reduce the burden on society. Urine samples from a COPD rat model induced by smoking were taken at week 2, week 4 and week 8. By LC-MS/MS, 15 differential proteins with human orthologs were identified. After smoking for 2 weeks when there were no significant pathological changes, 8 differential proteins were identified: 2 proteins had been reported to be markers of COPD, while 4 proteins were associated with COPD. After smoking for 4 weeks, which is when slight pathological changes were observed, 7 differential proteins were identified: 3 of them were reported to be associated with COPD, while 1 protein had been reported to be a marker of COPD. After smoking for 8 weeks, there were significant pathological changes: 5 differential proteins were identified, 3 of which were reported to be associated with COPD. The results of this study suggest that differential urinary proteins may provide important clues for the early diagnosis of COPD.","Protein homeostasis is crucial for viability of all organisms, and mutations that enhance protein aggregation cause different human pathologies, including polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases, such as some spinocerebellar ataxias or Huntington disease. Here, we report that neuronal Stomatin-like protein UNC-1 protects against aggregation of prone-to-aggregate proteins, like polyQs, \u03b1-synuclein and \u03b2-amyloid, in C. elegans. UNC-1, in IL2 neurons, antagonizes the function of the cytosolic sulfotransferase SSU-1 in neurohormonal signalling from ASJ neurons. The target of this hormone is the nuclear hormone receptor NHR-1, which acts cell-autonomously to protect from aggregation in muscles. A second nuclear hormone receptor, DAF-12, functions oppositely to NHR-1 to maintain protein homeostasis. Transcriptomics analyses reveal deep changes in the expression of genes involved in fat metabolism, in unc-1 mutants, which are regulated by NHR-1. This suggest that fat metabolism changes, controlled by neurohormonal signalling, contributes to modulate protein homeostasis.","Pregnancy 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations are associated with maternal and fetal health outcomes. Using physiological human placental perfusion and villous explants, we investigate the role of the placenta in regulating the relationships between maternal 25(OH)D and fetal physiology. We demonstrate active placental uptake of 25(OH)D3 by endocytosis, placental metabolism of 25(OH)D3 into 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D3], with subsequent release of these metabolites into both the maternal and fetal circulations. Active placental transport of 25(OH)D3 and synthesis of 1,25(OH)2D3 demonstrate that fetal supply is dependent on placental function rather than simply the availability of maternal 25(OH)D3. We demonstrate that 25(OH)D3 exposure induces rapid effects on the placental transcriptome and proteome. These map to multiple pathways central to placental function and thereby fetal development, independent of vitamin D transfer. Our data suggest that the underlying epigenetic landscape helps dictate the transcriptional response to vitamin D treatment. This is the first quantitative study demonstrating vitamin D transfer and metabolism by the human placenta, with widespread effects on the placenta itself. These data demonstrate a complex interplay between vitamin D and the placenta and will inform future interventions using vitamin D to support fetal development and maternal adaptations to pregnancy.","Kidney stone disease (nephrolithiasis) is a major clinical and economic health burden1,2 with a heritability of ~45-60%3. To identify genetic variants associated with nephrolithiasis we performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and meta-analysis in British and Japanese populations, including 12,123 nephrolithiasis cases and 416,928 controls. Twenty loci associated with nephrolithiasis were identified, ten of which are novel. A novel CYP24A1 locus is predicted to affect vitamin D metabolism and five loci, DGKD, DGKH, WDR72, GPIC1, and BCR, are predicted to influence calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) signaling. In a validation cohort of nephrolithiasis patients the CYP24A1-associated locus correlated with serum calcium concentration and number of kidney stone episodes, and the DGKD-associated locus correlated with urinary calcium excretion. Moreover, DGKD knockdown impaired CaSR-signal transduction in vitro, an effect that was rectifiable with the calcimimetic cinacalcet. Our findings indicate that genotyping may inform risk of incident kidney stone disease prior to vitamin D supplementation and facilitate precision-medicine approaches, by targeting CaSR-signaling or vitamin D activation pathways in patients with recurrent kidney stones.","Several reports emphasized the importance of inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) in hindering osteoblast differentiation and bone matrix mineralization. Its ubiquitous presence is thought to prevent \u201csoft\u201d tissue calcification, whereas its degradation to Pi in bones and teeth by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) may facilitate crystal growth. While the inhibiting role of PPi on osteoblast differentiation and function is largely understood, less is known about its effects on osteoclast determination and activity. In this study, we investigated the role of PPi in bone resorption using calverial organ cultures ex vivo. We present an evidence that PPi stimulated calvarial bone resorption marked by calcium (Ca2+) release in the condition media (CM). We then examined PPi effects on osteoclast differentiation using mouse bone marrow-derived monocytes (BMMs). Our results revealed that PPi enhanced osteoclast differentiation ex vivo, marked by increased number and size of TRAP-stained mature osteoclasts. Moreover, PPi stimulated osteoclastogenesis in BMMs co-cultured with osteoblasts. These data supported the increased osteoclast activity in bone resorption using functional osteo-assays. The finding of PU.1-Egr-1 dependent up-regulation of c-FMS and RANK receptors in BMMs supported the enhanced pre-osteoclast commitment and differentiation. Moreover, osteoclast survival was enhanced by activation of MITF-BCL-2 pathway that was mediated by MAPK-ERK1/2 signaling. Last, our data showed that PPi up-regulated ANK; PPi transporter, during osteoclast differentiation through ERK1/2 phosphorylation whereas mutation of ANK inhibited osteoclastogenesis. Collectively, our data suggest that PPi promotes osteoclast differentiation, survival, and function through PU.1 up-regulation and MITF phosphorylation whereas ANK loss-of-function inhibited osteoclastogenesis.","Multiplexed gene-signature-based phenotypic assays are increasingly used for the identification and profiling of small molecule-tool compounds and drugs. Here we introduce a method (provided as R-package) for the quantification of the dose-response potency of a gene-signature as EC50 and IC50 values.","Background Mast cells (MCs) are tissue-resident immune cells that are classified into two subsets in mice: connective tissue-type MCs (CTMCs) and mucosal type MCs (MMCs). Although both CTMCs and MMCs can be induced from bone marrow (BM)-derived hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in vitro, recent research on MC ontogeny has revealed that MMCs are maintained with a supply of BM-derived HSCs, while CTMCs are maintained locally by self-proliferation in steady state in vivo. However, how CTMCs, such as skin MCs, are maintained in an inflammatory state such as atopic dermatitis (AD) remains to be fully elucidated. Methods: MC903-induced AD model was used to identify BM-derived MCs in the skin. The infiltration and proliferation of MCs were evaluated by flow cytometry using CD45.1 BM-chimera mice and parabiosis. BM-derived MCs in AD-like skin were compared to resident MCs (rMCs) in gene expressions by RNA sequence analysis. The fate of BM-derived MCs in AD-like skin was investigated for expressions of CTMC markers and responses to compound 48/80. Results: In AD-like skin, significant increase of both rMCs and BM-derived MCs was observed. BM-derived MCs were derived from circulating MC progenitors (MCps) and were distinguished from rMCs by integrin\u03b27 expression, which was gradually downregulated in the skin. RNA sequence analysis showed that integrin\u03b27+ MCs in the skin shared characteristics of both MMC and CTMC. Integrin\u03b27+ MCs proliferated in situ and acquired the CTMC phenotypes in AD-like skin. Conclusions: Skin MCs are maintained in AD-like skin by both local proliferation of rMCs and infiltration/proliferation of BM-derived MCs, which differentiate toward CTMC in the skin.","CRISPR/Cas9 system has become a new versatile technology for genome engineering. It utilizes a single guide RNA (sgRNA) to recognize target sequences in genome function, and activates Cas9 endonucleases to cut the locus. In this study, we designed two target sites from conserved regions of vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene in mammalian cells, which cover more than 17 kb of chromosome region depending on the species. The efficacy of single sgRNA mediated gene specific modification was about 22% to 36%. Concurrently, targeted deletions of the intervening genomic segments were generated in chromosomes when the two sgRNAs worked simultaneously. The large genomic DNA segments ranging from 17.8Kb to 23.4 Kb could be precisely deleted in human and mouse chromosomes. Furthermore, the expression level of 24-hydroxylase (CYP24A1) regulated by VDR was significantly increased in cells treated with VDR CRISPR/Cas9 vectors. This study showed that CRISPR/Cas9 system can be employed to generate large genomic segment deletions in different species, providing sgRNAs are designed within conserved regions.","The pharmacodynamics effects of therapeutically administered calcitonin is observed for extended duration much beyond its reported short half-life. The rationale for this pharmacodynamic-pharmacokinetics mismatch of calcitonin is not known. Hence in this study the hypothesis on sub-compartmentalization of calcitonin in blood to explain the extended pharmacodynamics effects of calcitonin was evaluated in vitro using the sheep blood model. A relatively higher proportion of calcitonin concentration was observed in the WBC compartment. The partition coefficient analysis showed levels of calcitonin to be higher on WBC membrane compared to intracellular. Molecular modelling to assess the binding of calcitonin with protein in plasma and WBC membranes indicated physiologically relevant higher affinity with beta-2-microglobulin\u2019s in plasma and glycoproteins (CD44), sushi domains (CD25), fibronectins (CD206) and siglecs (CD22) on WBC membrane. The physiologically relevant higher affinity with several proteins on WBC membrane and plasma can be responsible for extended pharmacodynamics effects observed for therapeutically administered calcitonin.","Yeast autophagy, autolysis and apoptosis are triggered by nutrient starvation conditions that usually take place in winemaking. Biological aging of Sherry wines constitutes an enological environment suitable for the induction of these biological processes due to the scarcity of nutrients and formation of yeast social communities, i.e. biofilm; however, few studies have been carried out in this regard. Here, we perform a proteomic analysis to detect any autolysis/autophagy/apoptosis protein markers and/or proteins potentially related to these processes under flor forming and fermentative conditions. The scarce presence of autophagy proteins in flor biofilm forming conditions, the existence of autophagy inhibitors (e.g. Pph21p), and high quantity of crucial proteins for autolysis and apoptosis, Pep4p and Mca1p, respectively; indicate that autophagy may be silenced while autolysis and apoptosis are activated when the yeasts are forming flor. This is the first time that autophagy, autolysis and apoptosis have been studied as a whole in flor yeast to our knowledge.","Statin-related muscle side effects are a constant healthcare problem since patient compliance is dependent on side effects. Statins reduce plasma cholesterol levels and can prevent secondary cardiovascular disease. Although statin-induced muscle damage has been studied, preventive or curative therapies are yet to be reported.","Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major pathogen in children, elderly subjects and immunodeficient patients. PTX3 is a fluid phase pattern recognition molecule (PRM) involved in resistance to selected microbial agents and in regulation of inflammation. The present study was designed to assess the role of PTX3 in invasive pneumococcal infection. In a murine model of invasive pneumococcal infection, PTX3 was strongly induced in non-hematopoietic (particularly, endothelial) cells. The IL-1\u03b2/MyD88 axis played a major role in regulation of the Ptx3 gene expression. Ptx3-/- mice were more susceptible to invasive pneumococcal infection. Although high concentrations of PTX3 had opsonic activity in vitro, no evidence of PTX3-enhanced phagocytosis was obtained in vivo. In contrast, Ptx3-deficient mice showed enhanced recruitment of neutrophils and inflammation. Using P-selectin deficient mice, we found that protection against pneumococcus was dependent upon PTX3-mediated regulation of neutrophil inflammation. In humans, PTX3 genetic polymorphisms were associated with invasive pneumococcal infections. Thus, this fluid phase PRM plays an important role in tuning inflammation and resistance against invasive pneumococcal infection.","Background Vitamin D exerts regulatory roles via vitamin D receptor (VDR) in mucosal immunity, host defense, and inflammation involving host factors and microbiome. Human Vdr gene variation shapes the microbiome and VDR deletion leads to dysbiosis. Low VDR expression and diminished vitamin D/VDR signaling are observed in colon cancer. Nevertheless, how intestinal epithelial VDR is involved in tumorigenesis through gut microbiota remains unknown. We hypothesized that intestinal VDR protects mice against dysbiosis via modulating the JAK/STAT pathway in tumorigenesis. To test our hypothesis, we used an azoxymethane/Dextran Sulfate Sodium-induced cancer model in intestinal VDR conditional knockout (VDR\u0394IEC) mice, cell cultures, stem-cell derived colonoids, and human colon cancer samples.","Optimal cardiac function requires appropriate contractile proteins in each heart chamber. Atria require slow myosins to act as variable reservoirs, while ventricles demand fast myosin for swift pumping functions. Hence, myosin is under chamber-biased cis-regulatory control to achieve this functional distribution. Failure in proper regulation of myosin genes can lead to severe congenital heart dysfunction. The precise regulatory input leading to cardiac chamber-biased expression remains uncharted. To address this, we computationally and molecularly dissected the quail Slow Myosin Heavy Chain III (SMyHC III) promoter that drives specific gene expression to the atria to uncover the regulatory information leading to chamber expression and understand their evolutionary origins. We show that SMyHC III gene states are autonomously orchestrated by a complex nuclear receptor cis-regulatory element (cNRE), a 32- bp sequence with hexanucleotide binding repeats. Using in vivo transgenic assays in zebrafish and mouse models, we demonstrate that preferential atrial expression is achieved by the combinatorial regulatory input composed of atrial activation motifs and ventricular repression motifs. Through comparative genomics, we provide evidence that the cNRE emerged from an endogenous viral element, most likely through infection of an ancestral host germline. Our study reveals an evolutionary pathway to cardiac chamber-specific expression.","Most genome-wide association and fine-mapping studies to date have been conducted in individuals of European descent, and genetic studies of populations of Hispanic/Latino and African ancestry are still limited. In addition to the limited inclusion of these populations in genetic studies, these populations have more complex linkage disequilibrium structure that may reduce the number of variants associated with a phenotype. In order to better define the genetic architecture of these understudied populations, we leveraged &gt;100,000 phased sequences available from deep-coverage whole genome sequencing through the multi-ethnic NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program to impute genotypes into admixed African and Hispanic/Latino samples with commercial genome-wide genotyping array data. We demonstrate that using TOPMed sequencing data as the imputation reference panel improves genotype imputation quality in these populations, which subsequently enhances gene-mapping power for complex traits. For rare variants with minor allele frequency (MAF) &lt; 0.5%, we observed a 2.3 to 6.1-fold increase in the number of well-imputed variants, with 11-34% improvement in average imputation quality, compared to the state-of-the-art 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 and Haplotype Reference Consortium reference panels, respectively. Impressively, even for extremely rare variants with sample minor allele count &lt;10 (including singletons) in the imputation target samples, average information content rescued was &gt;86%. Subsequent association analyses of TOPMed reference panel-imputed genotype data with hematological traits (hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), and white blood cell count (WBC)) in ~20,000 self-identified African descent individuals and ~23,000 self-identified Hispanic/Latino individuals identified associations with two rare variants in the HBB gene (rs33930165 with higher WBC (p=8.1\u00d710\u221212) in African populations, rs11549407 with lower HGB (p=1.59\u00d710\u221212) and HCT (p=1.13\u00d710\u22129) in Hispanics/Latinos). By comparison, neither variant would have been genome-wide significant if either 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 or Haplotype Reference Consortium reference panels had been used for imputation. Our findings highlight the utility of TOPMed imputation reference panel for identification of novel associations between rare variants and complex traits not previously detected in similar sized genome-wide studies of under-represented African and Hispanic/Latino populations.","Faced with the current large-scale public health emergency, collecting, sorting, and analyzing biomedical information related to the \u201ccoronavirus\u201d should be done as quickly as possible to gain a global perspective, which is a basic requirement for strengthening epidemic control capacity. However, for human researchers studying the viruses and the hosts, the vast amount of information available cannot be processed effectively and in a timely manner, particularly when the scientific understanding may be limited, which can further lower the information processing efficiency. We present TWIRLS, a method that can automatically acquire, organize, and classify information. Additionally, independent functional data sources can be added to build an inference system using a machine-based approach, which can provide relevant knowledge to help human researchers quickly establish subject cognition and to make more effective decisions. TWIRLS can automatically analyze more than three million words in more than 14,000 literature articles in only 4 hours. Combining with generalized gene interaction databases creates a data interface that can help researchers to further analyze the information. Using the TWIRLS system, we found that an important regulatory factor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) may be involved in the host pathological changes on binding to the coronavirus after infection. After triggering functional changes in ACE2/AT2R, an imbalance in the steady-state cytokine regulatory axis involving the Renin-Angiotensin System and IP-10 leads to a cytokine storm.","Genome-wide profiling of open chromatin regions using DNase I and high-throughput sequencing (DNase-seq) is an increasingly popular approach for finding and studying regulatory elements. A variety of algorithms have been developed to identify regions of open chromatin from raw sequence-tag data, which has motivated us to assess and compare their performance.","The placenta is a fast-evolving organ with large morphological and histological differences across eutherians, but the genetic changes driving placental evolution have not been fully elucidated. Transposable elements, through their capacity to quickly generate genetic variation and affect host gene regulation, may have helped to define species-specific trophoblast gene expression programmes. Here, we assessed the contribution of transposable elements to human trophoblast gene expression as enhancers or promoters. Using epigenomic data from primary human trophoblast and trophoblast stem cell lines, we identified multiple endogenous retrovirus families with regulatory potential that lie close to genes with preferential expression in trophoblast. These largely primate-specific elements are associated with inter-species gene expression differences, and are bound by transcription factors with key roles in placental development. Using genetic editing we demonstrated that several elements act as transcriptional enhancers of important placental genes, such as CSF1R and PSG5. We also identified an LTR10A element that regulates ENG expression, affecting secretion of soluble ENG, with potential implications for preeclampsia. Our data show that transposons have made important contributions to human trophoblast gene regulation, and suggest that their activity may affect pregnancy outcomes.","Background Indonesia has an ageing population that can develop mobility health-related problems in the future, including osteoporosis, arthritis, sarcopenia, low back pain, neck pain, and peripheral neuropathy. However, there are limited references and research that look upon mobility health and problems surrounding it in Indonesia.","More than a decade of gut microbiome studies have a common goal for human health. As most of the disease studies sample the elderly or the middle-aged, a reference cohort for young individuals has been lacking. It is also not clear what other omics data need to be measured to better understand the gut microbiome. Here we present high-depth metagenomic shotgun sequencing data for the fecal microbiome together with other omics data in a cohort of 2,183 adults, and observe a number of vitamins, hormones, amino acids and trace elements to correlate with the gut microbiome and cluster with T cell receptors. Associations with physical fitness, sleeping habits and dairy consumption are identified in this large multi-omic cohort. Many of the associations are validated in an additional cohort of 1,404 individuals. Our comprehensive data are poised to advise future study designs to better understand and manage our gut microbiome both in population and in mechanistic investigations.","The striatum is one of the key nuclei for adequate control of voluntary behaviors and reinforcement learning. Two striatal projection neuron types, expressing either dopamine receptor D1 (D1R) or dopamine receptor D2 (D2R) constitute two independent output routes: the direct or indirect pathways, respectively. These pathways co-work in balance to achieve coordinated behavior. Two projection neuron types are equivalently intermingled in most striatal space. However, recent studies revealed two atypical zones in the caudal striatum: the zone in which D1R-neurons are the minor population (D1R-poor zone) and that in which D2R-neurons are the minority (D2R-poor zone). It remains obscure as to whether these imbalanced zones have similar properties on axonal projections and electrophysiology compared to other striatal regions. Based on morphological experiments in mice using immunofluorescence, in situ hybridization, and neural tracing, here, we revealed that the poor zones densely projected to the globus pallidus and substantia nigra pars lateralis, with a few collaterals in substantia nigra pars reticulata and compacta. Similar to that in other striatal regions, D1R-neurons were the direct pathway neurons. We also showed membrane properties of projection neurons in the poor zones were largely similar to those in the conventional striatum using in vitro electrophysiological recording. In addition, the poor zones existed irrespective of the age or sex of mice. We also identified the poor zones in the common marmoset as well as other rodents. These results suggest that the poor zones in the caudal striatum follow the conventional projection patterns irrespective of imbalanced distribution of projection neurons. The poor zones could be an innate structure and common in mammals. The unique striatal zones possessing highly restricted projections could relate to functions different from those of motor-related striatum.","A broad spectrum of human diseases are caused by mutations in the NADPH cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (POR). Cytochrome P450 proteins perform several reactions, including the metabolism of steroids, drugs, and other xenobiotics. In 2004 the first human patients with defects in POR were reported, and over 250 variations in POR are known. Information about the effects of POR variants on drug metabolizing enzymes is limited and has not received much attention. By analyzing the POR sequences from genomics databases, we identified potentially disease-causing variations and characterized these by in vitro functional studies using recombinant proteins. Proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified for activity assays. Activities of cytochrome P450 enzymes were tested in vitro using liposomes prepared with lipids into which P450 and P450 reductase proteins were embedded. Here we are reporting the effect of POR variants on drug metabolizing enzymes CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A5 which are responsible for the metabolism of many drugs. POR Variants A115V, T142A, A281T, P284L, A287P, and Y607C inhibited activities of all P450 proteins tested. Interestingly, the POR variant Q153R showed a reduction of 20-50% activities with CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 but had a 400% increased activity with CYP3A5. The A287P is most common POR mutation found in patients of European origin, and significantly inhibited drug metabolism activities which has important consequences for monitoring and treatment of patients. In vitro, functional assays using recombinant proteins provide a useful model for establishing the metabolic effect of genetic mutations. Our results indicate that detailed knowledge about POR variants is necessary for correct diagnosis and treatment options for persons with POR deficiency and the role of changes in drug metabolism and toxicology due to variations in POR needs to be addressed.","The MED1 subunit of the Mediator complex is an essential coactivator of nuclear receptor-mediated transcriptional activation. While structural requirements for ligand-dependent binding of classical coactivator motifs of MED1 to numerous nuclear receptor ligand-binding domains have been fully elucidated, the recognition of the full-length or truncated coactivator by full nuclear receptor complexes remain unknown. Here we present structural details of the interaction between a large part of MED1 comprising its structured N-terminal and the flexible receptor-interacting domains and the mutual heterodimer of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and the retinoid X receptor (RXR) bound to their cognate DNA response element. Using a combination of structural and biophysical methods we show that the ligand-dependent interaction between VDR and the second coactivator motif of MED1 is crucial for complex formation and we identify additional, previously unseen, interaction details. In particular, we identified RXR regions involved in the interaction with structured N-terminal domain of MED1, as well as VDR regions outside the classical coactivator binding cleft affected by coactivator recruitment. These findings highlight important roles of each receptor within the heterodimer in selective recognition of MED1 and contribute to our understanding of the nuclear receptor-coregulator complexes.","Background Sarcopenia is a serious public health problem. The ceRNA network has been demonstrated vital in the development of skeletal muscle, but there is currently no effective method to assess the risk of sarcopenia. The purpose of this research is to create and authenticate a ceRNA pathway based on a predictive model of sarcopenia.","The transcriptome of nutrient sensing and the regulation of gut motility by nutrients in a stomachless fish with a short digestive tract; the ballan wrasse (Labrus berggylta) were investigated. Using an in vitro model, we differentiate how signals initiated by physical stretch and nutrients modulate the gut evacuation rate and motility patterns, and transcriptomic changes. Stretch on the intestine by inert cellulose initiated fast evacuation out of the anterior intestine compared to the digestible protein and lipid. Stretch on the intestine upregulated genes associated with increased muscle activity, whereas nutrients stimulated pathways related to ribosomal activity and the increase in the expression of several neuropeptides which are directly involved in gut motility regulation. Our findings show that physical pressure in the intestine initiate contractions propelling the matter towards the exit, whereas the sensing of nutrients modulates the motility to prolong the residence of digesta in the digestive tract for optimal digestion.","Background African American (AA) prostate cancer (PCa) appears uniquely sensitive to 1\u03b1,25(OH)2D3 signaling, compared to European American (EA) PCa, but the extent and impact of vitamin D receptor genomic functions remain poorly defined.","The mechanisms underlying retinal development have not been completely elucidated. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are novel essential mediators of cell-to-cell communication with emerging roles in developmental processes. Nevertheless, the identification of EVs in human retinal tissue, characterization of their cargo, and analysis of their potential role in retina development has not been accomplished. Three-dimensional retinal tissue derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) provide an ideal developmental system to achieve this goal. Here we report that hiPSC-derived retinal organoids release exosomes and microvesicles with small noncoding RNA cargo. EV miRNA cargo-predicted targetome correlates with GO pathways involved in mechanisms of retinogenesis relevant to specific developmental stages corresponding to hallmarks of native human retina development. Furthermore, uptake of EVs by human retinal progenitor cells leads to changes in gene expression correlated with EV miRNA cargo predicted gene targets, and mechanisms involved in retinal development, ganglion cell and photoreceptor differentiation and function.","Background Trials testing the effect of vitamin D or omega-3 fatty acids (n3-PUFA) supplementation on major depressive disorder (MDD) reported conflicting findings. These trials were boosted by epidemiological evidence suggesting an inverse association of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH-D) and n3-PUFA levels with MDD. Observational associations may emerge from unresolved confounding, shared genetic risk, or direct causal relationships. We explored the nature of these associations exploiting data and statistical tools from genomics.","Objective We quantified changes in dispensing of common medicines proposed for \u201cre-purposing\u201d due to their perceived benefits as therapeutic or preventive for COVID-19 in Australia, a country with relatively low COVID-19 incidence in the first year of the pandemic.","Purpose Vitamin D has been proposed as a potential causal factor in COVID-19 risk. We aimed to establish whether blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration was associated with COVID-19 mortality, and inpatient confirmed COVID-19 infection, in UK Biobank participants.","  Outcome-dependent sampling designs are common in many different scientific\nfields including epidemiology, ecology, and economics. As with all\nobservational studies, such designs often suffer from unmeasured confounding,\nwhich generally precludes the nonparametric identification of causal effects.\nNonparametric bounds can provide a way to narrow the range of possible values\nfor a nonidentifiable causal effect without making additional untestable\nassumptions. The nonparametric bounds literature has almost exclusively focused\non settings with random sampling, and the bounds have often been derived with a\nparticular linear programming method. We derive novel bounds for the causal\nrisk difference, often referred to as the average treatment effect, in six\nsettings with outcome-dependent sampling and unmeasured confounding for a\nbinary outcome and exposure. Our derivations of the bounds illustrate two\napproaches that may be applicable in other settings where the bounding problem\ncannot be directly stated as a system of linear constraints. We illustrate our\nderived bounds in a real data example involving the effect of vitamin D\nconcentration on mortality.\n","Mendelian Randomization (MR) is an important approach to modelling causality in non-experimental settings. MR uses genetic instruments to test causal relationships between exposures and outcomes of interest. Individual genetic variants have small effects, and so, when used as instruments, render MR liable to weak instrument bias. Polygenic scores have the advantage of larger effects, but may be characterized by direct pleiotropy, which violates a central assumption of MR.","Objectives We aimed to analyze factors impacting the Covid-19 epidemic on a macro level, comparing multiple countries across the world, and verifying the occurrence at a micro level through cluster analysis.","Background Autonomic dysfunction is a common complication of post-acute sequalae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC)/long COVID, however prevalence and severity rates are unknown.","Aim and Objective The aim of the study was to investigate the relationships between insulin receptor substrate (IRS) 1 (Gly972Arg) and IRS2 (Gly1057Asp) genes with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in Asian Indians.","It has been widely recognized that a critical time window for neurodevelopment occurs in early life, and that the host\u2019s gut microbiome plays an important role in neurodevelopment. While murine models have demonstrated that the maternal gut microbiome also influences offspring brain development, for humans it is still unclear if the critical time window for the association between the gut microbiome and neurodevelopment is prenatal, postnatal or both. Here we leverage a large-scale human study and compare the associations between the gut microbiota and metabolites from mothers and their children with the children\u2019s neurodevelopment. We show, for the first time, that the maternal gut microbiome is more relevant than the children\u2019s gut microbiome to the children\u2019s neurodevelopment in the first year of life. Interestingly, the roles of the same taxa with respect to neurodevelopment can be opposite at the two stages of fetal neurodevelopment. These findings shed light on potential therapeutic interventions to prevent neurodevelopmental disorders.","Background The impact of COVID-19 varies markedly, not only between individual patients but also between different populations. We hypothesised that differences in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes might influence this variation.","The food addiction model suggests neurobiological similarities between substance-related and addictive disorders and obesity. While structural brain differences have been consistently reported in these conditions, little is known about the neuroanatomical correlates of food addiction. We therefore assessed whether food addiction, assessed with the Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS), related to obesity, personality and brain structure in a large population-based sample (n=625; 20-59 years old, 45% women). A higher YFAS symptom score correlated with obesity and disinhibited eating. In a whole-brain analysis, YFAS symptom score was not associated with cortical thickness nor subcortical gray matter volumes. Higher body mass index (BMI) correlated with reduced thickness of (pre)frontal, temporal and occipital cortex. Bayes factor analysis suggested that BMI and - to a smaller extent - YFAS symptom score contributed independently to right lateral orbitofrontal cortex thickness. Our study shows that food addiction is not associated with neuroanatomical differences in a large population-based sample, and does not account for the major part of obesity-associated gray matter alterations. Yet, food addiction might explain additional variance in orbitofrontal cortex, a hub area of the reward network. Longitudinal studies implementing both anatomical and functional MRI could further disentangle the neural mechanisms of addictive eating behaviors.","Tooth resorption (TR) is one of the most common dental diseases in cats. It is a painful disease characterised by progressive dental destruction, which eventually results in loss of teeth. The aetiology of the disease remains unclear, but associations with old age, breed, other oral and dental diseases, and certain environmental factors have been suspected. We collected health and environmental information of 8115 Finnish cats from 41 breeds through an online survey for cat owners to study TR in Finland with an observational study. The frequency of TR that the owner reported as veterinarian-diagnosed was 3.9% in the entire data (316/8115) and 15% in cats that the owner reported as having veterinarian-diagnosed oral or dental disease (316/2070). We determined the risk factors and breed variation of feline TR by logistic regression with the entire data and a case-control study in a more defined population drawn from the entire data. In the entire data, we defined those cats that the owners had reported as being diagnosed with TR by a veterinarian as TR-cats and compared them to all other cats. In the case-control study, we included only cats with owner-reported veterinarian-diagnosed oral and dental diseases. We defined cats with TR-diagnosis made under sedation as TR-cases. Other veterinarian-diagnosed TR-cats were excluded. Cats with other oral and dental diseases were used as controls. The model with the entire population included 308 TR-cats compared with 7508 cats, and the case-control study included 198 TR-cats and 1683 controls. Although the diagnoses were reportedly made by a veterinarian, the owner answered the survey and might have understood, remembered, or interpreted the diagnoses in a way that could affect the results. The results indicated an increasing risk of TR with age. Dental calculus, gingivitis, and periodontitis were potential risk factors for TR. These findings and the interaction between dental calculus and gingivitis suggest that inflammatory changes caused by dental calculus increase the risk of TR. Keeping food available constantly was a potential protective factor. We found that Cornish Rex, European, and Ragdoll breeds were at higher risk for TR. The observed differences between breeds highlight a genetic contribution.","Aim To evaluate associations of plasma 25(OH)D status with the likelihood of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection and hospitalization.","Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common chronic degenerative joint disease affecting articular cartilage and underlying bone. Both genetic and environmental factors appear to contribute to the development of this disease. Specifically, pathological levels of biomechanical stress on joints play a notable role in disease initiation and progression. Population-level gene expression studies of cartilage cells experiencing biomechanical stress may uncover gene-by-environment interactions relevant to OA and human joint health. To build a foundation for such studies, we applied differentiation protocols to develop an in vitro system of chondrogenic cell lines (iPSC-chondrocytes). We characterized gene regulatory responses of three human iPSC-chondrocyte lines to cyclic tensile strain treatment. We measured the contribution of biological and technical factors to gene expression variation in this system and, even in this small sample, found several genes that exhibit inter-individual expression differences in response to mechanical strain, including genes previously implicated in OA. Expanding this system to include iPSC-chondrocytes from a larger number of individuals will allow us to characterize and better understand gene-by-environment interactions related to OA and joint health.","Suspended animation states such as hibernation or diapause allow organisms to survive extreme environments. But the mechanisms underlying the evolution of these extreme survival states are unknown. The African turquoise killifish has evolved diapause as a form of suspended development to survive the complete drought that occurs every year in its habitat. Here we show that many gene duplicates \u2013 paralogs \u2013 exhibit specialized expression in diapause versus normal development in the African turquoise killifish. Surprisingly, paralogs with specialized expression in diapause are evolutionarily very ancient, and they are also present even in vertebrates that do not exhibit diapause. Profiling the chromatin accessibility landscape among different fish species reveals an evolutionarily recent increase in chromatin accessibility at these very ancient paralogs, suggesting rewiring of their regulatory landscape. The increase in chromatin accessibility in the African turquoise killifish is linked to the presence of new binding sites for transcription factors (e.g., FOXO, REST, and PPAR), due to both de novo mutations and transposable element insertion. Interestingly, accessible chromatin regions in diapause are enriched for lipid metabolism genes. By performing lipidomics in different fish species, we uncover a specific lipid profile in African turquoise killifish embryos in diapause. Notably, select very long-chain fatty acids are high in diapause, suggesting they may be used for long-term survival in this state. Together, our multi-omic analysis indicates that diapause is driven by regulatory innovation of very ancient gene programs that are critical for survival. Our work also suggests a mechanism for how complex adaptations evolve in nature and offers strategies by which a suspended animation program could be reactivated in other species for long-term preservation.","Background Little is known about the relative influence of demographic, behavioural, and vaccine-related factors on risk of post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection. We aimed to identify risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection after primary and booster vaccinations.","Publicly available genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics exhibit uneven quality, which can impact the validity of follow-up analyses. First, we present an overview of possible misspecifications that come with GWAS summary statistics. Then, in both simulations and real data analyses, we show that additional information such as imputation INFO scores, allele frequencies, and per-variant sample sizes in GWAS summary statistics can be used to detect possible issues and correct for misspecifications in the GWAS summary statistics. One important motivation for us is to improve the predictive performance of polygenic scores built from these summary statistics. Unfortunately, due to the lack of reporting standards for GWAS summary statistics, this additional information is not systematically reported. We also show that using well-matched LD references can improve model fit and translate into more accurate prediction. Finally, we discuss how to make polygenic score methods such as lassosum and LDpred2 more robust to these misspecifications to improve their predictive power.","Objective This study aimed to determine whether serum vitamin D is independently associated with COVID-19 infection and outcomes in patients with COVID-19.","Objectives To investigate the possible role of Vitamin D (Vit D) deficiency via unregulated inflammation in COVID-19 complications and associated mortality.","INTRODUCTION Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a global pandemic. Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with susceptibility to infectious disease. In this study, the association between COVID-19 outcomes and vitamin D levels in patients attending a COVID-19 reference center in Mexico City are examined.","Steroid hormones promote stem cell self-renewal in many tissues; however, the molecular mechanisms by which hormone signaling is integrated with niche-derived signals are largely uncharacterized. In the Drosophila ovary, the steroid hormone ecdysone promotes germline stem cell (GSC) self-renewal. Despite strong evidence that ecdysone modulates the reception of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signals in GSCs, transcriptional targets of ecdysone signaling that facilitate BMP reception are unknown. Here, we report that ecdysone signaling promotes the expression of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) squid, hephaestus, Hrb27C, and Hrb87F in GSCs. These hnRNPs functionally interact with ecdysone signaling to control GSC number and are cell autonomously required in GSCs for their maintenance. We demonstrate that hnRNPs promote GSC self-renewal by binding to transcripts essential for proper BMP signaling, including the BMP receptors thickveins and punt. Our findings support the model that stem cells coordinate local and long-range signals at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels to maintain self-renewal in response to physiological demand.","Although amyloid beta (A\u03b2) deposition is one of the major causes of white matter (WM) alterations in Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), little is known about the underlying basis of WM damage and its association with global structural connectivity and network topology. We aimed to dissect the contributions of WM microstructure to structural connectivity and network properties in the ArcA\u03b2 mice model of A\u03b2 amyloidosis.","Background The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) first identified in Wuhan in December 2019 became a pandemic within a few months of its discovery. The impact of COVID-19 is due to both its rapid spread and its severity, but the determinants of severity have not been fully delineated.","Background Vitamin D inadequacy affects almost 50% of adults in the United States and is associated with numerous adverse health effects. Vitamin D concentration [25(OH)D] is a complex trait with genetic and environmental predictors that work in tandem to influence 25(OH)D and may determine how much vitamin D intake is required to reach an optimal 25(OH)D concentration. To date, there has been little investigation into how genetics and environment interact to affect 25(OH)D.","Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor beta/delta (PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4) is a nuclear receptor ubiquitously expressed in cells whose signaling controls inflammation and metabolism. However, there are great discrepancies in understanding the role of PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4, having both anti- and pro-effects on inflammation. Understanding the PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 mechanism of action may provide new molecular mechanisms for treating a variety of inflammatory-related diseases.","Besides its functions in the skeletomuscular system, vitamin D also promotes protective immunity against viral pathogens. Viral sensing by mammalian cells triggers nuclear activation of RelA/NF-\u03baB and IRF3 factors, which collaborate in mediating the early induction of antiviral type 1 interferons (T1-IFNs). Autocrine T1-IFN signaling further accumulates otherwise negligibly expressed IRF7 in virus-infected cells that then sustains T1-IFN production in a positive feedback. Surprisingly, prior cell-culture studies revealed that vitamin D actually suppresses signal-induced RelA activation. Indeed, it remains unclear how vitamin D limits viral multiplication in a cell-autonomous manner. Here, we examined the role of vitamin D in controlling cellular infections by the Chandipura virus (CHPV), a cytoplasmic RNA virus implicated in human epidemics. We found that vitamin D conditioning produced an altered cell state less permissive for CHPV multiplication because of the heightened expression of T1-IFNs. It is thought that viruses also induce a distinct RelB/NF-\u03baB activity, which counteracts RelA-driven T1-IFN expressions in infected cells. Our analyses instead characterized a basal nuclear RelB activity, which was downregulated upon vitamin D-mediated suppression of RelB synthesis. Interestingly, this vitamin D-RelB pathway provoked IRF7-mediated positive autoregulation augmenting constitutive T1-IFN expressions even in the absence of viral infections. Accordingly, RelB deficiency rendered redundant, while IRF7 depletion abrogated antiviral vitamin D actions. In sum, our study suggests that the homeostatic state of the signaling circuitry comprising of the NF-\u03baB and T1-IFN pathways connects micronutrients to antiviral immunity at the cellular level.","Importance The benefit of vitamin D treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains unclear.","Background Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder in which the respiratory system gets clogged with mucus leads to progressive lung damage. There is no known cure for CF but several treatments to manage symptoms and reduce complications. Vitamin D deficiency is common in CF associated with increased infection and inflammation. This systematic review and meta-analysis will evaluate the effectiveness of vitamin D treatment in reducing respiratory tract infection and inflammation in patients with CF.","Background The interplay between hosts and their associated microbiome is now recognized as a fundamental basis of the ecology, evolution and development of both players. These interdependencies inspired a new view of multicellular organisms as \u201cmetaorganisms\u201d. The goal of the Collaborative Research Center \u201cOrigin and Function of Metaorganisms\u201d is to understand why and how microbial communities form long-term associations with hosts from diverse taxonomic groups, ranging from sponges to humans in addition to plants.","Background Excessive and continuous exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) can cause skin cancer (SC), photoaging, and cataracts. Photoprotection (PhP) is the most important tool in preventing against these harmful effects. Elementary and high school students should be targeted in PhP campaigns because the solar radiation that youngers receive increases the risk of SC in adulthood. However, PhP policies are scarce in developing countries.","Background Herbal medicinal products have a long-standing history of use in the therapy of common respiratory infections. In the COVID-19 pandemic, they may have the potential for symptom relief in non-severe or moderate disease cases. Here we describe the results derived by in vitro screening of five herbal medicinal products with regard to their potential to i) interfere with the binding of the human Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 protein, ii) modulate the release of the human defensin HBD1 and cathelicidin LL-37 from human A549 lung cells upon Spike S1 protein stimulation and iii) modulate the release of IFN-\u03b3 from activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The investigated extracts were: Sinupret extract (SINx), Bronchipret thyme-ivy (BRO TE), Bronchipret thyme-primrose (BRO TP), Imupret (IMU), and Tonsipret (TOP).","Nineteenth century medical understanding of human metabolism was limited, therefore, the incidence of metabolic deficiencies was not fully recorded. In addition, the transition from agricultural based mode of life to the industrial one significantly changed the pattern of these metabolic deficiencies. They were further altered by colonisation of distant continents. Palaeopathological study of skeletal remains from the early industrialised colonial era allowed light to be shed on the metabolic stresses produced by this new mode of life. Aims of this study were to investigate manifestations of disease in skeletal remains from 65 (20 adults, 45 sub-adults) migrant settlers buried in the \u201cfree ground\u201d of St Mary\u2019s Anglican Church Cemetery (1847 to 1927). An area allocated for burials paid for by the South Australian Government. Skeletal manifestations were determined and interpreted in terms of their multiple aetiologies. Findings were compared with those published for two 19th century British samples. Skeletal manifestations, commonly related to metabolic deficiencies, were observed. Areas of abnormal porosity of bone cortices were seen in 9 adults and 12 sub-adults, flaring of metaphyses was seen in one sub-adult, flaring of costochondral junctions of the ribs was seen in one sub-adult. Porous lesions of orbital roof bones (Types 3 to 5) were seen on three sub-adults. Micro-CT scans of tooth samples located interglobular dentine in three individuals. Comparison of St Mary\u2019s findings with St Martins, Birmingham, and St Peter\u2019s, Wolverhampton, UK, showed more individuals from St Mary\u2019s had areas of abnormal porosity of bone cortices possibly related to vitamin C deficiency. However, St Mary\u2019s sample displayed fewer changes attributable to vitamin D deficiency as expected in a country with greater UV irradiation. This indicates that, although the early industrialisation produced metabolic stresses, change of the environment through colonisation of new continents altered the distribution of metabolic deficiencies.","The gut microbiome has been implicated in a variety of physiological states, but controversy over causality remains unresolved. Here, we performed bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses on 3,432 Chinese individuals with whole genome, whole metagenome, anthropometric, and blood metabolic trait data. We identified 58 causal relationships between the gut microbiome and blood metabolites, and replicated 43 of them. Increased relative abundances of fecal Oscillibacter and Alistipes were causally linked to decreased triglyceride concentration. Conversely, blood metabolites such as glutamic acid appeared to decrease fecal Oxalobacter, and members of Proteobacteria were influenced by metabolites such as 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid, alanine, glutamate, and selenium. Two-sample MR with data from Biobank Japan partly corroborated results with triglyceride and with uric acid, and also provided causal support for published fecal bacterial markers for cancer and cardiovascular diseases. This study illustrates the value of human genetic information to help prioritize gut microbial features for mechanistic and clinical studies.","Aims Histological examination of the rib is of critical value in perinatal pathology and points to the health of the child preceding death. The rib is considered ideal because it is the most rapidly growing long bone in infants and demonstrates growth arrest at onset of the insult. We aimed to identify: 1: changes in the perichondrial ring in the rib of infants and children up to 16 months of age dying suddenly at our institution and 2: any association with presence of histological changes of vitamin D deficiency (VDD) /metabolic bone disease (MBD) in the growth plate.","Retrotransposons are genetic elements capable of their own propagation and insertion into the human genome. Because of their mutagenic potential, retrotransposons are heavily suppressed by mechanisms including DNA methylation. Increased age is associated with decreasing DNA methylation of the LINE-1 retrotransposon and may partially explain the predisposition towards malignancy with advancing age. Vitamin D has been investigated for its effects on DNA methylation at LINE-1 elements with mixed results. This study hypothesised that LINE-1 DNA methylation is altered by vitamin D exposure and age. Using whole genome bisulfite sequencing of adult and newborn haematopoietic progenitors, DNA methylation at LINE-1 elements was not found to vary between cells cultured with or without calcitriol, both in adults and newborns. In contrast, several LINE-1 regions were found to be differentially methylated between adults and children, but these were not uniformly hypermethylated in paediatric cells. The results of this study suggest that at least in haematopoietic cells, vitamin D does not appear to affect LINE-1 methylation.","Shift work has serious health impacts due to desynchronization of the circadian rhythm; consequently, the workers have increased sleep disturbances. Another impact is working hours, which can contribute to decreased sun exposure and lead to the development of hypovitaminosis D. Vitamin D has been implicated in extraskeletal functions in many physiological mechanisms, including sleep. Therefore, we aimed to verify the association between sleep parameters and hypovitaminosis D in shift workers with cardiovascular risk. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 82 male rotating shift workers (24-57 years old) with at least one cardiovascular risk factor (such as hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, abdominal obesity, physical inactivity, hypertension, and smoking). Polysomnography was used to evaluate sleep parameters, while vitamin D levels were measured using a chemiluminescence method. Logistic regression was used to model the association between hypovitaminosis D and sleep parameters after adjustment for relevant covariates. Hypovitaminosis D (&lt; 20 ng/mL) was seen in 30.5% of the workers. Shift workers with hypovitaminosis D had lower sleep efficiency, increased microarousal index, and lower arterial oxygen saturation after adjusting for seasonality, age, and body fat. Therefore, we suggest that hypovitaminosis D is associated with greater sleep disturbances in rotating shift workers with cardiovascular risk factors.","Cocaine dependence is a complex psychiatric disorder that is highly comorbid with other psychiatric traits. Twin and adoption studies suggest that genetic variants contribute substantially to cocaine dependence susceptibility, which has an estimated heritability of 65-79%. Here we performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of cocaine dependence using four datasets from the dbGaP repository (2,085 cases and 4,293 controls, all of them selected by their European ancestry). Although no genome-wide significant hits were found in the SNP-based analysis, the gene-based analysis identified HIST1H2BD as associated with cocaine-dependence (10% FDR). This gene is located in a region on chromosome 6 enriched in histone-related genes, previously associated with schizophrenia (SCZ). Furthermore, we performed LD Score regression analysis with comorbid conditions and found significant genetic correlations between cocaine dependence and SCZ, ADHD, major depressive disorder (MDD) and risk taking. We also found, through polygenic risk score analysis, that all tested phenotypes can significantly predict cocaine dependence status: SCZ (R2=2.28%; P=1.21e-26), ADHD (R2=1.39%; P=4.5e-17), risk taking (R2=0.60%; P=2.7e-08), MDD (R2=1.21%; P=4.35e-15), children\u2019s aggressiveness (R2=0.3%; P=8.8e-05) and antisocial behavior (R2=1.33%; P=2.2e-16). To our knowledge, this is the largest reported cocaine dependence GWAS meta-analysis in European-ancestry individuals. We identified suggestive associations in regions that may be related to cocaine dependence and found evidence for shared genetic risk factors between cocaine dependence and several comorbid psychiatric traits. However, the sample size is limited and further studies are needed to confirm these results.","Background Vitamin D levels have been reported to be associated with COVID-19 susceptibility, severity and mortality events.. We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the use of vitamin D intervention on COVID-19 outcomes.","A growing body of evidence shows that poor vitamin D status has been associated with an increased susceptibility to viral and bacterial respiratory infections. In this study, we aimed to examine the association between vitamin D and COVID-19 risk and outcomes, and to explore potential causal effects. We used logistic regression to identify associations between different vitamin D variables (25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration (25-OHD), ambient UVB and genetically-predicted 25-OHD concentrations) and COVID-19 (risk of infection, hospitalisation and death) in 495,780 participants from UK Biobank. We subsequently performed a Mendelian Randomisation (MR) study to test if there was any causal effect. In total, 1,746 COVID-19 cases and 399 COVID-19 deaths occurred between March and June 2020. We found significant inverse associations between COVID-19 infection and 25-OHD in univariable models, but these associations were non-significant after adjustment for confounders. Ambient UVB was strongly and inversely associated with hospitalization and death. Although the main MR analysis showed that genetically-predicted vitamin D levels were not causally associated with COVID-19 risk, MR sensitivity analysis using weighted mode method indicated a potential causal effect (OR=0.72, 95% CI:0.53-0.98; P=0.041). In conclusion, our study found suggestive evidence of association between vitamin D and the risk or severity of COVID-19 but further studies are needed.","Background Altered gait is a frequent feature of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), as is vitamin D deficiency. Treatment with memantine and vitamin D can protect cortical axons from exposure to amyloid-\u03b2 and glutamate toxicity, suggesting this combination may mitigate altered gait in AD.","Bile acids (BAs) are lipid emulsifying metabolites synthesized in hepatocytes and maintained in vivo through enterohepatic circulation between the liver and small intestine1. As detergents, BAs can cause toxicity and inflammation in enterohepatic tissues2. Nuclear receptors maintain BA homeostasis in hepatocytes and enterocytes3, but it is unclear how mucosal immune cells tolerate high BA concentrations in the small intestine lamina propria (siLP). We previously reported that CD4+ T effector (Teff) cells upregulate expression of the xenobiotic transporter MDR1/ABCB1 in the siLP to prevent BA toxicity and suppress Crohn\u2019s disease-like small bowel inflammation4. Here, we identify the nuclear xenobiotic receptor, constitutive androstane receptor (CAR/NR1I3), as a regulator of MDR1 expression in T cells, and safeguard against BA toxicity and inflammation in the small intestine. CAR was activated and induced large-scale transcriptional reprograming in Teff cells infiltrating the siLP, but not the colon. CAR induced expression of detoxifying enzymes and transporters in siLP Teff cells, as in hepatocytes, but also the key anti-inflammatory cytokine, Il10. Accordingly, CAR-deficiency in T cells exacerbated, whereas pharmacologic CAR activation suppressed, BA-driven ileitis in T cell-reconstituted Rag\u2212/\u2212 mice. These data suggest that CAR acts locally in small intestinal T cells to detoxify BAs and resolve inflammation. Activation of this program offers an unexpected strategy to treat small bowel Crohn\u2019s disease, and provides evidence of lymphocyte sub-specialization within the small intestine.","Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as a class of genes whose importance has yet to be fully realized. It is becoming clear that the primary function of lncRNAs is to regulate gene expression, and they do so through a variety of mechanisms that are critically tied to their subcellular localization. Although most lncRNAs are poorly understood, mapping lncRNA subcellular localization can provide a foundation for understanding these mechanisms. Here, we present an initial step toward uncovering the localization landscape of lncRNAs in the human retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) using high throughput RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq). To do this, we differentiated human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into RPE, isolated RNA from nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, and performed RNA-Seq on both. Furthermore, we investigated lncRNA localization changes that occur in response to oxidative stress. We discovered that, under normal conditions, most lncRNAs (76%) are seen in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm to a similar degree, but of the transcripts that are highly enriched in one compartment, more are nuclear (18.6%) than cytoplasmic (5.6%). Interestingly, under oxidative stress conditions, we observed an increase in lncRNA localization in both nuclear (23.5%) and cytoplasmic (9.7%) fractions. In addition, we found that nuclear localization was partially attributable to the presence of previously described nuclear retention motifs, while adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing appeared to play a very minimal role. Our findings regarding lncRNA localization in the RPE provide two avenues for future research: 1) how lncRNAs function in the RPE, and 2) how one environmental factor, in isolation, may play a role in retinal disease pathogenesis.","Brain aging trajectories among those of the same chronological age can vary significantly. Statistical models have been created for estimating the apparent age of the brain, or predicted brain age, with imaging data. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown the potential to more accurately predict brain age. We trained a CNN on 16,998 UK Biobank subjects, and in validation tests found that it was more accurate than a regression model for predicting brain age. A genome-wide association study was conducted on CNN-derived predicted brain age whereby we identified single nucleotide polymorphisms from four independent loci significantly associated with brain aging. One locus has been previously reported to be associated with brain aging. The three other loci were novel. Our results suggest that a more accurate brain age prediction enables the discovery of novel genetic associations, which may be valuable for identifying other lifestyle factors associated with brain aging.","Introduction Immunosenescence leads to increased morbidity and mortality associated with viral infections and weaker vaccine responses. This has been well documented for seasonal influenza and the current pandemic with Sars-Cov2, which disproportionately impact older adults, particularly those in residential aged care facilities. Inadequate nutrient intake associated with impaired immunity, respiratory and muscle function are likely to augment the effects of immunosenescence. In this study, we test whether the effects of inadequate nutrition can be reversed by multi-nutrient supplementation, consequently enhancing vaccine responses, reducing the risk of viral infections, and improving respiratory and muscle function.","The TAM receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) Mer and Axl have been implicated in liver disease, yet our understanding of their roles in liver homeostasis and injury is limited. We therefore examined the performance of Mer and Axl mutant mice during aging, and in four models of liver injury. We find that Mer and Axl are most prominently expressed in Kupffer and hepatic endothelial cells, and that as Axl-/-Mertk-/- mice normally age, they develop profound liver disease. We further find that Mer signaling is critical to the phagocytosis of apoptotic hepatocytes that are generated during acute hepatic injury, and that Mer and Axl act in concert to inhibit injury-triggered cytokine production. TAM expression in Kupffer cells is crucial for these effects. In contrast, we show that Axl is uniquely important in mitigating liver damage during acute acetaminophen intoxication. Finally, we demonstrate that Axl exacerbates the fibrosis that develops in a model of chronic hepatic injury. These divergent effects have important implications for the design and implementation of TAM-directed therapeutics that target these RTKs in the liver.","For the first time, we report the influence of vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 on genome-wide gene expression in whole blood from healthy women representing two ethnic groups, white European and South Asian. In this randomised placebo-controlled trial, participants were given daily physiological doses (15 \u00b5g) of either vitamin D2 or D3 for 12 weeks and changes in the transcriptome were compared relative to the transcriptome at baseline. While there was some overlap in the repertoire of differentially expressed genes after supplementation with each vitamin D source, most changes were specific to either vitamin D3 or vitamin D2, suggesting that each form of the vitamin may have different effects on human physiology. Notably, following vitamin D3 supplementation, the majority of changes in gene expression reflected a down-regulation in the activity of genes, many encoding components of the innate and adaptive immune systems. These are consistent with the emerging concept that vitamin D orchestrates a shift in the immune system towards a more tolerogenic status. Moreover, divergent changes were observed following supplementation with either vitamin D3 or vitamin D2 for gene expression associated with type 1 and type 2 interferon activity. This is particularly intriguing as interferons play a critical role in the innate response to infection and aberrant type 1 interferon signalling is implicated in severe COVID-19 disease. The observed differences in gene expression after supplementation with vitamin D2 compared with vitamin D3 warrant a more intensive investigation of the biological effects of the two forms of vitamin D on human physiology.","We developed a novel method for efficiently estimating time-varying selection coefficients from genome-wide ancient DNA data. In simulations, our method accurately recovers selective trajectories, and is robust to mis-specification of population size. We applied it to a large dataset of ancient and present-day human genomes from Britain, and identified seven loci with genome-wide significant evidence of selection in the past 4500 years. Almost all of them are related to increased vitamin D or calcium levels, and we conclude that lack of vitamin D and consequent low calcium was consistently the most important selective pressure in Britain since the Bronze Age. However, the strength of selection on individual loci varied substantially over time, suggesting that cultural or environmental factors moderated the genetic response to this pressure. Of 28 complex anthropometric and metabolic traits, skin pigmentation was the only one with significant evidence of polygenic selection, further underscoring the importance of phenotypes related to vitamin D. Our approach illustrates the power of ancient DNA to characterize selection in human populations and illuminates the recent evolutionary history of Britain.","  Objective: 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) deficiency has been associated with\nsleep disorders in adults. Only three cross-sectional studies were performed in\nchildren and showed an association between 25OHD deficiency and both\nobstructive sleep apnea syndrome and primary snoring. No longitudinal study has\nbeen performed in children from the general population. We analyzed the\nassociation between cord-blood vitamin D level at birth and night-sleep\nduration trajectories for children between 2 and 5-6 years old in a\nnon-clinical cohort.Method: We included 264 children from the French EDEN\nmother-child birth-cohort with both cord-blood 25OHD level determined by\nradio-immunoassay at birth, and night-sleep trajectories for children between 2\nand 5-6 years old obtained by the group-based trajectory modeling method.\nAssociations between 25OHD and sleep trajectories were assessed by multinomial\nlogistic regression adjusted for maternal and child characteristics.Results:\nThe trajectories short sleep (&lt;10h30/night), medium-low sleep\n(10h30-11h00/night), medium-high sleep ($\\approx$11h30/night), long sleep\n($\\ge$11h30/night) and changing sleep (decreased from $\\ge$11h30 to\n10h30-11h00/night) represented 5%, 46%, 37%, 4% and 8% of the children,\nrespectively. The mean 25OHD level was 19 ng/ml (SD=11, range 3 to 63). It was\n12 (SD=7), 20 (SD=11), 19 (SD=10), 14 (SD=7) and 16 (SD=8) ng/ml for children\nwith short, medium-low, medium-high, long and changing sleep trajectories,\nrespectively. On adjusted analysis, for each 1-ng/ml decrease in 25OHD level,\nthe odds of belonging to the short sleep versus medium-high sleep trajectory\nwas increased (odds ratio =1.12, 95% confidence interval [1.01-1.25]). We found\nno other significant association between 25OHD level and other\ntrajectories.Conclusion: Low 25OHD level at birth may be associated with\nincreased probability of being a persistent short sleeper in preschool years.\nThese results need confirmation.\n","Background COVID-19 is a major pandemic that has killed more than 196,000 people. The COVID-19 disease course is strikingly divergent. Approximately 80-85% of patients experience mild or no symptoms, while the remainder develop severe disease. The mechanisms underlying these divergent outcomes are unclear. Emerging health disparities data regarding African American and homeless populations suggest that vitamin D insufficiency (VDI) may be an underlying driver of COVID-19 severity. To better define the VDI-COVID-19 link, we determined the prevalence of VDI among our COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU) patients.","Background Research is ongoing to identify an effective way to prevent or treat COVID-19, but thus far these efforts have not yet identified a possible solution. Prior studies indicate the protective role of Ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation in human health, mediated by vitamin D synthesis. In this study, we empirically outline a negative association of UVB radiation as measured by ultraviolet index (UVI) with the number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 (COVID- 19 deaths).","Aim Recently, several clinical trials have tested the effect of prenatal vitamin D supplementation in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) patients and their newborns. However, their participant attrition, an important determinant of the internal validity, remains poorly explored. Therefore, this review protocol is proposed, which aims to compare it between prenatal vitamin D supplemented and not supplemented GDM patients.","Context Cold-induced activation of thermogenesis modulates energy metabolism, but the role of humoral mediators is not completely understood.","The transitions from foraging to farming and later to pastoralism in Stone Age Eurasia (c. 11-3 thousand years before present, BP) represent some of the most dramatic lifestyle changes in human evolution. We sequenced 317 genomes of primarily Mesolithic and Neolithic individuals from across Eurasia combined with radiocarbon dates, stable isotope data, and pollen records. Genome imputation and co-analysis with previously published shotgun sequencing data resulted in &gt;1600 complete ancient genome sequences offering fine-grained resolution into the Stone Age populations. We observe that: 1) Hunter-gatherer groups were more genetically diverse than previously known, and deeply divergent between western and eastern Eurasia. 2) We identify hitherto genetically undescribed hunter-gatherers from the Middle Don region that contributed ancestry to the later Yamnaya steppe pastoralists; 3) The genetic impact of the Neolithic transition was highly distinct, east and west of a boundary zone extending from the Black Sea to the Baltic. Large-scale shifts in genetic ancestry occurred to the west of this \u201cGreat Divide\u201d, including an almost complete replacement of hunter-gatherers in Denmark, while no substantial ancestry shifts took place during the same period to the east. This difference is also reflected in genetic relatedness within the populations, decreasing substantially in the west but not in the east where it remained high until c. 4,000 BP; 4) The second major genetic transformation around 5,000 BP happened at a much faster pace with Steppe-related ancestry reaching most parts of Europe within 1,000-years. Local Neolithic farmers admixed with incoming pastoralists in eastern, western, and southern Europe whereas Scandinavia experienced another near-complete population replacement. Similar dramatic turnover-patterns are evident in western Siberia; 5) Extensive regional differences in the ancestry components involved in these early events remain visible to this day, even within countries. Neolithic farmer ancestry is highest in southern and eastern England while Steppe-related ancestry is highest in the Celtic populations of Scotland, Wales, and Cornwall (this research has been conducted using the UK Biobank resource); 6) Shifts in diet, lifestyle and environment introduced new selection pressures involving at least 21 genomic regions. Most such variants were not universally selected across populations but were only advantageous in particular ancestral backgrounds. Contrary to previous claims, we find that selection on the FADS regions, associated with fatty acid metabolism, began before the Neolithisation of Europe. Similarly, the lactase persistence allele started increasing in frequency before the expansion of Steppe-related groups into Europe and has continued to increase up to the present. Along the genetic cline separating Mesolithic hunter-gatherers from Neolithic farmers, we find significant correlations with trait associations related to skin disorders, diet and lifestyle and mental health status, suggesting marked phenotypic differences between these groups with very different lifestyles. This work provides new insights into major transformations in recent human evolution, elucidating the complex interplay between selection and admixture that shaped patterns of genetic variation in modern populations.","Background Understanding the immune response to natural infection by SARS-CoV-2 is key to pandemic management, especially in the current context of emerging variants. Uncertainty remains regarding the efficacy and duration of natural immunity against reinfection.","Dengue virus (DENV) is a prevalent human pathogen, infecting approximately 400 million individuals per year and causing symptomatic disease in approximately 100 million. A distinct feature of dengue is the increased risk for severe disease in some individuals with preexisting DENV-specific immunity. One proposed mechanism for this phenomenon is antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), in which poorly-neutralizing IgG antibodies from a prior infection opsonize DENV to increase infection of Fc gamma receptor-bearing cells. While IgM and IgG are the most commonly studied DENV-reactive antibody isotypes, our group and others have described the induction of DENV-specific serum IgA responses during dengue. We hypothesized that monomeric IgA would be able to neutralize DENV without the possibility of ADE. To test this, we synthesized IgG and IgA versions of two different DENV-reactive monoclonal antibodies. We demonstrate that isotype-switching does not affect the antigen binding and neutralization properties of the two mAbs. We show that DENV-reactive IgG, but not IgA, mediates ADE in an Fc gamma receptor-positive K562 cells. Furthermore, we show that IgA potently antagonizes the ADE activity of IgG. These results suggest that levels of serum DENV-reactive IgA induced by DENV infection might regulate the overall ADE activity of DENV-immune plasma in vivo and warrants further study as a predictor of disease risk and/or therapeutic.","Lactation-induced bone loss occurs due to high calcium requirements for fetal growth but skeletal recovery is normally achieved promptly post-weaning. Dietary protein is vital for fetus and mother but the effects of protein undernutrition on the maternal skeleton and skeletal muscles is largely unknown. We used mouse dams fed with normal (N, 20%) or low (L, 8%) protein diet during gestation and lactation and maintained on the same diets (NN, LL) or switched from low to normal (LN) during a 28d skeletal restoration period post lactation. Skeletal muscle morphology and neuromuscular junction integrity was not different between any of the groups. However, dams fed the low protein diet showed extensive bone loss by the end of lactation, followed by full skeletal recovery in NN dams, partial recovery in LN and poor bone recovery in LL dams. Primary osteoblasts from low protein diet fed mice showed decreased in vitro bone formation and decreased osteogenic marker gene expression; promoter methylation analysis by pyrosequencing showed no differences in Bmpr1a, Ptch1, Sirt1, Osx and Igf1r osteoregulators, while miR-26a, -34a and -125b expression was found altered in low protein fed mice. Therefore, normal protein diet is indispensable for maternal musculoskeletal health during the reproductive period.","Atopic dermatitis (AD) patients have been observed to have lower vitamin D levels. Previous studies have found little evidence that vitamin D levels causally influence the risk of AD, but the reverse direction has not yet been investigated.","Lamins provide a nuclear scaffold for compartmentalization of genome function that is important for genome integrity. The mechanisms whereby lamins regulate genome stability remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate a crucial role for A-type lamins preserving the integrity of the replication fork (RF) during replication stress (RS). We find that lamins bind to nascent DNA strands, especially during RS, and ensure the recruitment of fork protective factors RPA and RAD51. These ssDNA-binding proteins, considered the first and second responders to RS respectively, play crucial roles in the stabilization, remodeling and repair of the stalled fork to ensure proper restart and genome stability. Reduced recruitment of RPA and RAD51 upon lamins depletion elicits replication fork instability (RFI) depicted by MRE11 nuclease-mediated degradation of nascent DNA, RS-induced accumulation of DNA damage, and increased sensitivity to replication inhibitors. Importantly, in contrast to cells deficient in various homology recombination repair proteins, the RFI phenotype of lamins-depleted cells is not linked to RF reversal. This suggests that the point of entry of nucleases is not the reversed fork, but regions of ssDNA generated during RS that are not protected by RPA and RAD51. Consistently, RFI in lamins-depleted cells is rescued by forced elevation of the heterotrimeric RPA complex or RAD51. These data unveil a clear involvement of structural nuclear proteins in the protection of ssDNA from the action of nucleases during RS by warranting proper recruitment of ssDNA binding proteins RPA and RAD51 to stalled RFs. In support of this model, we show physical interaction between RPA and lamins. Our study also suggests that RS is a major source of genomic instability in laminopathies and in lamins-depleted tumors.","Background This study investigated the cost-effectiveness of vitamin D3 supplementation in older adults in Ireland, with year-round vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration &lt;30 nmol/L) (13% of Irish adults), from the perspective of the Health Service Executive (HSE).","Objective The aim of this study was to investigate the association of food insecurity score with the status of Covid-19 infection.","Background SARS-CoV-2 virus causes a very wide range of COVID-19 disease severity in humans: from completely asymptomatic to fatal, and the reasons behind it are often not understood. There is some data that Vitamin D may have protective effect, so authors decided to analyze European country-wide data to determine if Vitamin D levels are associated with COVID-19 population death rate.","The high mortality rate of gastric cancer (GC) is in part due to the absence of initial disclosure of its biomarkers. The recognition of important genes associated in GC is therefore recommended to advance clinical prognosis, diagnosis and and treatment outcomes. The current investigation used the microarray dataset GSE113255 RNA seq data from the Gene Expression Omnibus database to diagnose differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Pathway and gene ontology enrichment analyses were performed, and a protein\u2011protein interaction network, modules, target genes - miRNA regulatory network and target genes - TF regulatory network were constructed and analyzed. Finally, validation of hub genes was performed.  The 1008 DEGs identified consisted of 505 up regulated genes and 503 down regulated genes. The pathways and GO functions of the up and down regulated genes were mainly enriched in pyrimidine deoxyribonucleosides degradation, extracellular structure organization, allopregnanolone biosynthesis and digestion. FN1, PLK1, ANLN, MCM7, MCM2, EEF1A2, PTGER3, CKB, ERBB4 and PRKAA2 were identified as the most important genes of GC, and validated by TCGA database, The Human Protein Atlas database, receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis and RT-PCR.  Bioinformatics analysis might be useful method to explore the molecular pathogensis of GC. In addition, FN1, PLK1, ANLN, MCM7, MCM2, EEF1A2, PTGER3, CKB, ERBB4 and PRKAA2 might be the most important genes of GC.","Background and Aims High alcohol intake is associated with increased mortality. We aimed to identify factors affecting mortality in people drinking extreme amounts. Approach and Results. Information was obtained from the UK Biobank on approximately 500,000 participants aged 40-70 years at baseline assessment in 2006-2010. Habitual alcohol intake, lifestyle and physiological data, laboratory test results, and hospital diagnoses and death certificate data (to June 2020) for 5136 men (2.20% of male participants) and 1504 women (0.60%) who reported taking \u226580 g/day or \u226550g/day, respectively, were used in survival analysis. Compared to all other participants, their mortality HRs were 9.40 (95% CI 7.00-12.64) for any liver disease (ICD-10 K70-K76), 2.02 (1.89-2.17) for all causes, 1.89 (1.69-2.12) for any cancer (C00-C99), and 1.87 (1.61-2.17) for any circulatory disease (I00-I99). Liver disease diagnosis or abnormal liver function tests predicted not only deaths attributed to liver disease but also those from cancers or circulatory diseases. Mortality among excessive drinkers was also associated with quantitative alcohol intake, diagnosed alcohol dependence (ICD-10 F10.2), and current smoking at assessment.  Conclusions. People with chronic excessive alcohol intake experience decreased average survival but there is substantial variation in their mortality, with liver abnormality and alcohol dependence each associated with worse prognosis. Clinically, patients with these risk factors as well as high alcohol intake should be considered for early or intensive management. Research can usefully focus on the factors predisposing to dependence or liver abnormality.","The arrival of farming in Europe around 8,500 years ago necessitated adaptation to new environments, pathogens, diets, and social organizations. While indirect evidence of adaptation can be detected in patterns of genetic variation in present-day people, ancient DNA makes it possible to witness selection directly by analyzing samples from populations before, during and after adaptation events. Here we report the first genome-wide scan for selection using ancient DNA, capitalizing on the largest genome-wide dataset yet assembled: 230 West Eurasians dating to between 6500 and 1000 BCE, including 163 with newly reported data. The new samples include the first genome-wide data from the Anatolian Neolithic culture, who we show were members of the population that was the source of Europe\u2019s first farmers, and whose genetic material we extracted by focusing on the DNA-rich petrous bone. We identify genome-wide significant signatures of selection at loci associated with diet, pigmentation and immunity, and two independent episodes of selection on height.","Objectives To assess the association between blood circulating Vitamin D levels and colorectal cancer risk in the Asian population.","In the largest DNA-based study of domestic cat to date, 11,036 individuals (10,419 pedigreed cats from 91 breeds and breed types and 617 non-pedigreed cats) were genotyped via commercial panel testing, elucidating the distribution and frequency of known genetic variants associated with blood type, disease and physical traits across cat breeds. Blood group determining variants, which are relevant clinically and in cat breeding, were genotyped to assess the across breed distribution of blood types A, B and AB. Extensive panel testing identified 13 disease-associated variants in 48 breeds or breed types for which the variant had not previously been observed, strengthening the argument for panel testing across populations. The study also indicates that multiple breed clubs have effectively used DNA testing to reduce disease-associated genetic variants within certain pedigreed cat populations. Appearance-associated genetic variation in all cats is also discussed. Additionally, we combined genotypic data with phenotype information and clinical documentation, actively conducted owner and veterinarian interviews, and recruited cats for clinical examination to investigate the causality of a number of tested variants across different breed backgrounds. Lastly, genome-wide informative SNP heterozygosity levels were calculated to obtain a comparable measure of the genetic diversity in different cat breeds.","Selection against migrants is key to maintaining genetic differences between populations linked by dispersal. Yet, migrants are not just passively weeded out by selection. Migrants may mitigate fitness costs by proactively choosing among available habitats, or by phenotypic plasticity. We previously reported that a reciprocal transplant of lake and stream stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) found little support for divergent selection. We revisit that experiment to test whether phenotypic plasticity in gene expression may have helped migrants adjust to unfamiliar habitats. We measured gene expression profiles in stickleback via TagSeq and tested whether migrants between lake and stream habitats exhibited a plastic response to their new environment that allowed them to converge on the expression profile of adapted natives. We report extensive gene expression differences between genetically divergent lake and stream stickleback, despite gene flow. But for many genes, expression was highly plastic. Fish transplanted into the adjoining habitat partially converged on the expression profile typical of their new habitat. This suggests that expression plasticity may soften the impact of migration. Nonetheless, lake and stream fish differed in survival rates and parasite infection rates in our study, implying that expression plasticity is not fast or extensive enough to fully homogenize fish performance.","Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a negative effect on the health and behavior of the world\u2019s population.","Linking phenotypes to specific gene expression profiles is an extremely important problem in biology, which has been approached mainly by correlation methods or, more fundamentally, by studying the effects of gene perturbations. However, genome-wide perturbations involve extensive experimental efforts, which may be prohibitive for certain organisms. On the other hand, the characterization of the various phenotypes frequently requires an expert\u2019s subjective interpretation, such as a histopathologist\u2019s description of tissue slide images in terms of complex visual features (e.g. \u2018acinar structures\u2019). In this paper, we use Deep Learning to eliminate the inherent subjective nature of these visual histological features and link them to genomic data, thus establishing a more precisely quantifiable correlation between transcriptomes and phenotypes. Using a dataset of whole slide images with matching gene expression data from 39 normal tissue types, we first developed a Deep Learning tissue classifier with an accuracy of 94%. Then we searched for genes whose expression correlates with features inferred by the classifier and demonstrate that Deep Learning can automatically derive visual (phenotypical) features that are well correlated with the transcriptome and therefore biologically interpretable. As we are particularly concerned with interpretability and explainability of the inferred histological models, we also develop visualizations of the inferred features and compare them with gene expression patterns determined by immunohistochemistry. This can be viewed as a first step toward bridging the gap between the level of genes and the cellular organization of tissues.","Background Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and low birth weight (LBW) have been widely reported as an independent risk factor for hypercholesterolemia and increased hepatic cholesterol underlying liver dysfunction in adulthood. However, the specific impact of uteroplacental insufficiency (UPI), a leading cause of LBW in developed world, on hepatic cholesterol metabolism in later life, is ill defined and is clinically relevant in understanding later life liver metabolic health trajectories.","Objective To assess the peripheral immune system of newly diagnosed relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients and compare it to healthy controls (HC).","Schizophrenia (SZ) is a pervasive neurodevelopmental disorder entailing social and cognitive deficits, including marked problems with language. Its complex multifactorial etiopathogenesis, including genetic and environmental factors, is still widely uncertain. SZ incidence has always been high and quite stable in human populations, across time and regardless of cultural implications, due to unclear reasons. It has been hypothesised that SZ pathophysiology may involve the biological components that changed during the recent human evolutionary history and led to our distinctive mode of cognition, which includes language skills. In this paper we explore this possibility, focusing on the self-domestication of the human species. This has been claimed to account for many human-specific distinctive traits, including aspects of our behaviour and cognition, and to favour the emergence of complex languages through cultural evolution. The \u201cdomestication syndrome\u201d in mammals comprises the constellation of traits exhibited by domesticated strains, seemingly resulting from the hypofunction of the neural crest. It is our intention to show that people with SZ exhibit more marked domesticated traits at the morphological, physiological, and behavioural levels. We also show that genes involved in domestication and neural crest development and function comprise nearly 20% SZ candidates, most of which exhibit altered expression profiles in the brain of SZ patients, specifically in areas involved in language processing. Based on these observations, we conclude that SZ may represent an abnormal ontogenetic itinerary for the human faculty of language, resulting, at least in part, from changes in genes important for the \u201cdomestication syndrome\u201d and, primarily involving the neural crest.","Recently emerged beta-coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in the current pandemic designated COVID-19. COVID-19 manifests as severe illness exhibiting systemic inflammatory response syndrome, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), thrombotic events, and shock, exacerbated further by co-morbidities and age1\u20133. Recent clinical reports suggested that the pulmonary failure seen in COVID-19 may not be solely driven by acute ARDS, but also microvascular thrombotic events, likely driven by complement activation4,5. However, it is not fully understood how the SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanisms mediate thrombotic events, and whether such mechanisms and responses are unique to SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared to other respiratory infections. We address these questions here, in the context of normal lung epithelia, in vitro and in vivo, using publicly available data. Our results indicate that plasmin is a crucial mediator which primes interactions between complement and platelet-activating systems in lung epithelia upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, with a potential for therapeutic intervention.","Given various risk profiles, manifestations, comorbidities, and outcomes for individuals with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), a one-size-fits-all approach towards treatment and management is inadequate, and there is a clear need for personalized medications to reduce rates of complications and comorbidities. Here, we leveraged comprehensive Electronic Medical Records (EMR) to identify associations between T2D comorbidities and medications and evaluated their biological determinants using EMR-linked genetic information. We discovered clinically novel associations supported by the previous laboratory studies; e.g. 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 receptor antagonists, ondansetron and granisetron, are protective against cognitive disorders, and clopidogrel is protective against retinopathy. Furthermore, potentially novel associations were validated by genetic analysis; e.g. association between gabapentin and cognitive disorders was supported via variants of its target genes, GRIN1 and CACNA2D2. These results of the current study open the door for optimizing treatment combinations to mitigate risks and for individualizing therapy based on T2D subtype risk profiles.","Objectives Vitamin D supplementation has been proposed for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, but the relationship between the two is inconclusive: Reduced serum vitamin D may predispose to COVID-19, but it may also be a secondary consequence of infection. The objective of this study was to assess the temporal association between serum vitamin D levels and COVID-19.","Background Few studies have evaluated the association between pre-existing vitamin D deficiency (VDD) and incident TB. We assessed the impact of baseline vitamin D on TB risk.","Reindeer are semi-domesticated ruminants that have adapted to the challenging northern Eurasian environment characterized by long winters and marked annual fluctuations in daylight. We explored the genetic makeup behind their unique characteristics by de novo sequencing the genome of a male reindeer and conducted gene family analyses with nine other mammalian species. We performed a population genomics study of 23 additional reindeer representing both domestic and wild populations and several ecotypes from various geographic locations. We assembled 2.66 Gb (N50 scaffold of 5 Mb) of the estimated 2.92 Gb reindeer genome, comprising 27,332 genes. The results from the demographic history analysis suggested marked changes in the effective population size of reindeer during the Pleistocene period. We detected 160 reindeer-specific and expanded genes, of which zinc finger proteins (n=42) and olfactory receptors (n=13) were the most abundant. Comparative genome analyses revealed several genes that may have promoted the adaptation of reindeer, such as those involved in recombination and speciation (PRDM9), vitamin D metabolism (TRPV5, TRPV6), retinal development (PRDM1, OPN4B), circadian rhythm (GRIA1), immunity (CXCR1, CXCR2, CXCR4, IFNW1), tolerance to cold-triggered pain (SCN11A) and antler development (SILT2). The majority of these characteristic reindeer genes have been reported for the first time here. Moreover, our population genomics analysis suggested at least two independent reindeer domestication events with genetic lineages originating from different refugial regions after the Last Glacial Maximum. Taken together, our study has provided new insights into the domestication, evolution and adaptation of reindeer and has promoted novel genomic research of reindeer.","Objectives To investigate causality of the association of serum vitamin D with the risk and severity of COVID-19 infection.","There are numerous guidelines developed for bone health. Yet it is unclear the differences in guideline development methods explain the variability in recommendations for vitamin D and calcium intakes. The objective of this systematic review was to collate and compare recommendations for vitamin D and calcium across bone health guidelines, assess methods used to form the recommendations, and explore which methodological factors were associated with these guideline recommendations. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and other databases indexing guidelines to identify records in English between 2009 and 2019. Guidelines or policy statements on bone health or osteoporosis prevention for generally healthy adults aged \u226540 years were eligible for inclusion. Two reviewers independently extracted recommendations on daily vitamin D and calcium intake, supplement use, serum 25 hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D] level, and sunlight exposure; assessed guideline development methods against 25 recommended criteria in the World Health Organization (WHO) Handbook for Guideline Development; and, identified types of evidence underpinning the recommendations. We included 47 eligible guidelines from 733 records: 74% of the guidelines provided vitamin D (200\u223c600-4000 IU/day) and 70% provided calcium (600-1200 mg/day) recommendations; 96% and 88% recommended vitamin D and calcium supplements, respectively; and 70% recommended a specific 25(OH)D concentration. The mean of meeting 25 WHO methodological criteria per guideline was 10 (95% CI: 9-12; interquartile range: 6-15). There was uncertainty in the associations between the methodological criteria and the proportion of guidelines that provided recommendations on daily vitamin D or calcium. Various types of evidence, ranging from previous bone guidelines, nutrient reference reports, systematic reviews, observational studies, to perspectives/editorials were used to underpin the recommendations. In conclusion, there is considerable variability in vitamin D and calcium recommendation and in guideline development methods in bone health guidelines. Effort is required to strengthen methodological rigor of guideline development and utilize the best available evidence to underpin public health nutrition.","Objective To evaluate the association between four iron biomarkers and sepsis.","Background Obstructive lung disease is a significant cause of morbidity and healthcare burden within the United States. A growing body of evidence has suggested that vitamin D levels can influence the course or incidence of obstructive lung disease. However, there is an insufficient previous investigation of this association.","  It is known that the primary source of dietary vitamin C is fruit and\nvegetables and the plasma level of vitamin C has been considered a good\nsurrogate biomarker of vitamin C intake by fruit and vegetable consumption. To\ncombine the information about association between vitamin C intake and the\nplasma level of vitamin C, numerical approximation methods for likelihood\nfunction of correlation coefficient are studied. The least squares approach is\nused to estimate a log-likelihood function by a function from a space of\nB-splines having desirable mathematical properties. The likelihood interval\nfrom the Highest Likelihood Regions (HLR) is used for further inference. This\napproach can be easily extended to the realm of meta-analysis involving sample\ncorrelations from different studies by use of an approximated combined\nlikelihood function. The sample correlations between vitamin C intake and serum\nlevel of vitamin C from many studies are used to illustrate application of this\napproach.\n","Although specific genes have been found to be associated with skin pigmentation, the global gene expression profile for the early stage of skin pigmentation and development in mammals is still not well understood. Here we reported a rare natural group of goat (Youzhou dark goat) featuring the dark skin of body including the visible mucous membranes, which may be an exclusive kind of large mammalian species with this special phenotype so far. In the present study, we characterized the 100-day-old fetal skin transcriptome in hyperpigmented (dark-skinned) and wild-type (white-skinned) goats using deep RNA-sequencing. A total of 923,013,870 raw reads from 6 libraries were obtained, and a large number of alternative splicing events were identified in the transcriptome of fetal skin, including the well-known melanogenic genes ASIP, TYRP1, and DCT, which were differentially expressed in the skin between the dark-skinned and white-skinned goats. Further analysis demonstrated that differential genes including ASIP, TYRP1, DCT, WNT2, RAB27A, FZD4, and CREB3L1 were significantly overrepresented in the melanogenesis pathway and several biological process associated with pigmentation. On the other hand, we identified 1616 novel transcripts in goat skin based on the characteristics of their expression level and gene composition. These novel transcripts may represent two distinct groups of nucleic acid molecules. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the characteristics of global gene expression at early stages of skin pigmentation and development, as well as describe an animal model for human diseases associated with pigmentation.","Vitamin D is an important hormonal molecule, which exerts genomic and non-genomic actions in maintaining brain development and adult brain health. Many epidemiological studies have associated vitamin D deficiency with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). Nevertheless, the underlying signaling pathway through which this occurs remains to be characterized. We were intrigued to find that although vitamin D levels are significantly low in AD patients, their hippocampal vitamin D receptor (VDR) levels are inversely increased in the cytosol of the brain cells, and colocalized with A\u03b242 plaques, gliosis and autophagosomes, suggesting that a non-genomic form of VDR is implicated in AD. Mechanistically, A\u03b242 induces the conversion of nuclear heterodimer of VDR/RXR heterodimer into a cytoplasmic VDR/p53 heterodimer. The cytosolic VDR/p53 complex mediates the A\u03b242\u2013induced autophagic apoptosis. Reduction of p53 activity in AD mice reverses the VDR/RXR formation and rescues AD brain pathologies and cognitive impairment. In line with the impaired genomic VDR pathway, the transgenic AD mice fed a vitamin D sufficient diet exhibit lower plasma vitamin D levels since early disease phases, raising the possibility that vitamin D deficiency may actually be an early manifestation of AD. Despite the deficiency of vitamin D in AD mice, vitamin D supplementation not only has no benefit but lead to exacerbated A\u03b242 depositions and cognitive impairment. Together, these data indicate that the impaired genomic vitamin D pathway links A\u03b242 to induce autophagic apoptosis, and suggest that VDR/p53 pathway could be targeted for the treatment of AD.","Introduction For more than 80 years convalescent or immune sera has been used in severe life threatening infections. Since March of this year a rapidly increasing number of publications have reported series of Convalescent plasma (CP) investigations in severely ill COVID-19 patients.","Background Global knowledge of treatment and outcomes of COVID-19 has been evolving since the onset of the pandemic.","Background and objective Vitamin D deficiency is associated with diabetes, cancer, immunological and cardiovascular diseases as well as increased mortality. It has, however, been difficult to show a causal relation in randomized, controlled trials. Mendelian randomization studies provide another option for testing causality, and results indicate relations between the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) level and some diseases, including mortality. We have from the Troms\u00f8 Study in 2012 published non-significant relations been vitamin D related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and mortality, but have since then genotyped additional subjects, the observation time is longer and new SNPs have been included.","Importance Patients with COVID-19 may exhibit 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency, but the beneficial effects of vitamin D3 supplementation in this disease remain to be proven by randomized controlled trials.","Objectives The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of interactive monitoring of professional dancer health with a variety of subjective and objective monitoring methods and delivering swift personalised clinical advice.","Background The use of Mendelian randomization (MR) in epidemiology has increased considerably in recent years, with a subsequent increase in systematic reviews of MR studies. We conducted a systematic review of tools designed for risk of bias and/or quality of evidence assessment in (MR) studies, and a review of systematic reviews of MR studies.","Arabidopsis root development is predicted to be regulated by yet unidentified carotenoid-derived metabolite(s). In this work, we screened known and putative carotenoid cleavage products and identified anchorene, a predicted carotenoid-derived dialdehyde (diapocarotenoid) that triggers anchor root development. Anchor roots are the least characterized type of root in Arabidopsis. They form at the root-shoot junction, particularly upon damage to the root apical meristem. Using Arabidopsis reporter lines, mutants and chemical inhibitors, we show that anchor roots originate from pericycle cells and that the development of this root type is auxin-dependent and requires carotenoid biosynthesis. Transcriptome analysis and treatment of auxin-reporter lines indicate that anchorene triggers anchor root development by modulating auxin homeostasis. Exogenous application of anchorene restored anchor root development in carotenoid-deficient plants, indicating that this compound is the carotenoid-derived signal required for anchor root development. Chemical modifications of anchorene led to a loss of anchor root promoting activity, suggesting that this compound is highly specific. Furthermore, we demonstrate by LC-MS analysis that anchorene is a natural, endogenous Arabidopsis metabolite. Taken together, our work reveals a new member of the family of carotenoid-derived regulatory metabolites and hormones.","The poor prognosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is attributed to the highly fibrotic stroma and complex multi-cellular microenvironment that is difficult to fully recapitulate in pre-clinical human models. To fast-track translation of therapies and to inform personalised medicine, we aimed to develop a whole-tissue ex vivo explant model that maintains viability, 3D multicellular architecture, and microenvironmental cues present in human pancreatic tumours. Patient-derived surgically-resected PDAC tissue was cut into 2 mm explants, cultured on gelatin sponges, and grown for 12 days. Immunohistochemistry revealed that human PDAC tissue explants were viable for 12 days and maintained their original tumour, stromal and extracellular matrix architecture. As proof-of-principle, human PDAC tissue explants responded to Abraxane\u00ae treatment with a 3.7-fold increase in cell-death (p=0.0007). PDAC explants were also transfected with polymeric nanoparticles+Cy5-siRNA and we observed abundant cytoplasmic distribution of nanoparticle+Cy5-siRNA throughout the PDAC explant tissue. Our novel model retains the 3D architecture of human pancreatic tumours and has several advantages over standard organoids: presence of functional multi-cellular stroma and fibrosis and no tissue manipulation, digestion, or artificial propagation of organoids. This provides an unprecedented opportunity to study PDAC biology, tumour-stromal interactions and rapidly assess therapeutic response that could drive personalised treatment for PDAC.","Insights from extreme-adapted organisms, which have evolved natural strategies for promoting survivability under severe environmental pressures, may help guide future research into novel approaches for enhancing human longevity. The cave-adapted Mexican tetra,Astyanax mexicanus, has attracted interest as a model system for metabolic resilience, a term we use to denote the property of maintaining robust health and longevity under conditions that would have highly deleterious effects in other organisms (Fig 1). Cave-dwelling populations of Mexi-can tetra exhibit elevated blood glucose and possess a mutation in the insulin receptor that in humans has been linked to Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome, a condition characterized by severe insulin resistance that causes numerous developmental abnormalities, is highly associated with debilitating progression, and drastically reduces lifespan. In addition, cavefish develop large numbers of hypertrophic visceral adipocytes and possess vastly enriched stores of body fat compared to surface-dwelling counterparts. However, cavefish appear to avoid the progression of the respective pathologies typically associated with these conditions, such as accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), chronic tissue inflammation, impaired growth due to insulin dysregulation, and low survivability due to arterial disease. The metabolic strategies underlying the resilience properties of A. mexicanus cavefish, and how they relate to environmental challenges of the cave environment, are poorly understood. Here, we provide an untargeted metabolomics study of long- and short-term fasting in two A. mexicanus cave populations and one surface population. We find that, although cave-fish share many similarities with metabolic syndrome normally associated with the human state of obesity, important differences emerge, including a reduction in cholesteryl esters and intermediates of protein glycation, and an increase in antioxidants and metabolites associated with hypoxia and longevity. We find important overlaps between metabolic alterations in cave-dwelling Mexican tetra and other models of resilience and extreme longevity, such as naked mole-rats, including enhanced reliance on sugars as an energy source and a trend toward more potent antioxidant activity. This work suggests that certain metabolic features associated with human pathologies are not intrinsically harmful, but are rather consequences of suboptimal adaptation of humans to survival under adverse metabolic conditions, and suggests promising avenues for future investigation into the role of metabolic strategies in evolutionary adaptation and health. We provide a transparent pipeline for reproducing our analysis and a Shiny app for other researchers to explore and visualize our dataset.","The genetic modules that contribute to human evolution are poorly understood. We identified positive selection for two independent involucrin (IVL) haplotypes in European (CEU) and Asian (JPT/CHB) populations for skin epidermis. CEU IVL associated with increased IVL and a known epidermal-specific enhancer underwent a recent selective sweep out-of-Africa correlating with increased northern latitude. CRISPR/Cas9 deletion of the mouse enhancer revealed enhancer-mediated cis regulation for Ivl expression with human population-specific enhancer reporter assays confirming the additive effect. Furthermore, IVL enhancer eQTLs associated with decreased IVL together with filaggrin loss-of-function variants are enriched in atopic dermatitis cases vs. controls. Together, our enhancer-IVL cis regulatory module findings reveal an emerging paradigm for recently evolved traits to impact skin disease risk in contemporary populations.","Although a defective vitamin D pathway has been widely suspected to be associated in SARS-CoV-2 pathobiology, the status of the vitamin D pathway and vitamin D-modulated genes in lung cells of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown. To understand the significance of the vitamin D pathway in SARS-CoV-2 pathobiology, computational approaches were applied to transcriptomic datasets from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cells of such patients or healthy individuals. Levels of vitamin D receptor, retinoid X receptor, and CYP27A1 in BALF cells of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 were found to be reduced. Additionally, 107 differentially expressed, predominantly downregulated genes modulated by vitamin D were identified in transcriptomic datasets from patient\u2019s cells. Further analysis of differentially expressed genes provided eight novel genes with a conserved motif with vitamin D-responsive elements, implying the role of both direct and indirect mechanisms of gene expression by the dysregulated vitamin D pathway in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Network analysis of differentially expressed vitamin D-modulated genes identified pathways in the immune system, NF-KB/cytokine signaling, and cell cycle regulation as top predicted pathways that might be affected in the cells of such patients. In brief, the results provided computational evidence to implicate a dysregulated vitamin D pathway in the pathobiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Background Evidence recommends that vitamin D might be a crucial supportive agent for the immune system, mainly in cytokine response regulation against COVID-19. Hence, we carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis in order to maximize the use of everything that exists about the role of vitamin D in the COVID-19.","Epigenetic mechanisms, like DNA methylation, determine immune cell phenotype. To understand the epigenetic alterations induced by helminth co-infections, we evaluated the longitudinal effect of ascariasis and schistosomiasis infection on CD4+ T cell DNA methylation and the downstream tuberculosis (TB)-specific and BCG-induced immune phenotype. All experiments were performed on human primary immune cells from a longitudinal cohort of recently TB-exposed children. Compared to age-matched uninfected controls, children with active Schistosoma haematobium and Ascaris lumbricoides infection had 751 differentially DNA methylated genes with 72% hyper-methylated. Gene ontology pathway analysis identified inhibition of IFN-\u03b3 signaling, cellular proliferation, and the Th1 pathway. Targeted RT-PCR after methyl-specific endonuclease digestion confirmed DNA hyper-methylation of the transcription factors BATF3, ID2, STAT5A, IRF5, PPARg, RUNX2, IRF4 and NFATC1 and cytokines or cytokine receptors IFNGR1, TNFS11, RELT (TNF receptor), IL12RB2 and IL12B (p&lt; 0.001; Sidak-Bonferroni). Functional blockage of the IFN-\u03b3 signaling pathway was confirmed with helminth-infected individuals having decreased up-regulation of IFN-\u03b3-inducible genes (Mann-Whitney p &lt; 0.05). Hypo-methylation of the IL-4 pathway and DNA hyper-methylation of the Th1 pathway was confirmed by antigen-specific multidimensional flow cytometry demonstrating decreased TB-specific IFN-\u03b3 and TNF and increased IL-4 production by CD4+ T cells (Wilcoxon signed rank P &lt;0.05). In S.haematobium infected individuals, these DNA methylation and immune phenotypic changes persisted at least six months after successful deworming. This work demonstrates that helminth infection induces DNA methylation and immune perturbations that inhibit TB-specific immune control and that the duration of these changes are helminth-specific.","Background Much research shows that blood calcidiol (25(OH)D3) levels correlate strongly with SARS-CoV-2 infection severity. There is open discussion regarding whether low D3 is caused by the infection or if deficiency negatively affects immune defense. The aim of this study was to collect further evidence on this topic.","Background Hypovitaminosis-D has been linked to neuropsychiatric conditions, but little is known about vitamin D status in individuals with chronic tic disorders (CTD). This study sought to determine whether vitamin D levels are associated with the severity of tics and presence and severity of comorbid obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and/ or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).","Background Risk for several common cancers is influenced by the transcriptomic landscape of the respective tissue-of-origin. Vitamin D influences in-vitro gene expression and cancer cell growth. We sought to determine whether oral vitamin D induces beneficial gene expression effects in human rectal epithelium and identify biomarkers of response.","We have undertaken an extensive Mendelian randomization (MR) study using methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) as genetic instruments to assess the potential causal relationship between genetic variation, DNA methylation and 139 complex traits. Using two-sample MR, we observed 1,191 effects across 62 traits where genetic variants were associated with both proximal DNA methylation (i.e. cis-mQTL) and complex trait variation (P&lt;1.39x10\u221208). Joint likelihood mapping provided evidence that the causal mQTL for 364 of these effects across 58 traits was also likely the causal variant for trait variation. These effects showed a high rate of replication in the UK Biobank dataset for 14 selected traits, as 121 of the attempted 129 effects replicated. Integrating expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data suggested that genetic variants responsible for 319 of the 364 mQTL effects also influence gene expression, which indicates a coordinated system of effects that are consistent with causality. CpG sites were enriched for histone mark peaks in tissue types relevant to their associated trait and implicated genes were enriched across relevant biological pathways. Though we are unable to distinguish mediation from horizontal pleiotropy in these analyses, our findings should prove valuable in identifying candidate loci for further evaluation and help develop mechanistic insight into the aetiology of complex disease.","Troxerutin (TXR), is a phytochemical reported to possess anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective effects. In this study, we aimed to exploit anti-arthritic properties of TXR using an adjuvant induced arthritic (AIA) rat model. AIA induced rats showed highest arthritis score at disease onset and by oral administration of TXR (50, 100, 200 mg/kg body weight), reduced to basal level in a dose dependent manner. Isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitative (iTRAQ) proteomics tool was employed to identify deregulated joint homogenate proteins in AIA and TXR treated rats to decipher probable mechanism of the TXR action in arthritis. iTRAQ analysis identified a set of 434 joint homogenate proteins with 65 deregulated proteins (log2 case/control \u22651.5) in AIA. Expressions of a set of important proteins (AAT, T-kininogen, vimentin, desmin, and nucleophosmin) that could classify AIA from healthy were validated using Western blot analysis. Western blot data corroborated proteomics findings. In silico protein-protein interaction study of joint homogenate proteome revealed that complement component 9, the major building blocks of the membrane attack complex (MAC) responsible for sterile inflammation, gets perturbed in AIA. Our dosimetry study suggests that a TXR dose of 200 mg/kg body weight for 15 days is sufficient to bring the arthritis score to basal levels in AIA rats. We have shown the importance of TXR as an anti-arthritis agent in AIA model and after additional investigation its arthritis ameliorating properties could be exploited for clinical usability.","We systematically investigated an ongoing debate about the possible correlation between SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) epidemiological outcomes and solar exposure in European countries, in the period of March \u2013 August 2020. For each country, we correlated its mortality data with solar insolation (watt/square metre) and objective sky cloudiness (as cloud fraction) derived from satellite weather data. We found a positive correlation between the monthly mortality rate and the overall cloudiness in that month (Pearson\u2019s r(35)=.779, P&lt;.001; linear model fitting the data, adjusted R2 =0.59). In Europe, in colder months, approximately 34% to 58% of the variance in COVID-19 mortality/million appears to be predicted by the cloudiness fraction of the sky, except in August in which only \u223c15% of the variance was explained. The data show a low, negative correlation between the mortality rate with the overall insolation received by the country area in that entire month (Pearson\u2019s r(35)=-0.622, P&lt;.001). Additionally, we did not find any statistically significant correlation between the mortality and the latitude of the countries when the \u201clatitude of a country\u201d was precisely defined as the average landmass location (country centroid). The unexpected correlation found between cloudiness and mortality could perhaps be explained by the following: 1) heavy cloudiness is linked with colder outdoor surfaces, which might aid virus survival; 2) reduced evaporation rate; 3) moderate pollution may be linked to both cloudiness and mortality; and 4) large-scale behavioural changes due to cloudiness (which perhaps drives people to spend more time indoors and thus facilitates indoor contamination).","The COVID-19 outbreak shows a huge variation in prevalence and mortality on geographical level but also within populations1. The ACE2 gene, identified as the SARS-CoV2 receptor, has been shown to facilitate the viral invasion and people with higher ACE2 expression generally are more severely affected2, 3. As there is a lot of variability in ACE2 expression between individuals we hypothesized that differential DNA methylation profiles could be (one of) the confounding factors explaining this variability. Here we show that epigenetic profiling of host tissue, especially in the ACE2 promoter region and its homologue ACE1, may be important risk factors for COVID-19. Our results propose that variable methylation can explain (part of) the differential susceptibility, symptom severity and death rate for COVID-19. Our findings are a promising starting point to further evaluate the potential of ACE1/2 methylation and other candidates as a predictor for clinical outcome upon SARS-CoV2 infection.","A later age at natural menopause (ANM) has been linked to several aging-associated traits including an increased risk of breast and endometrial cancer as well as a decreased risk of lung cancer, osteoporosis, and Alzheimer disease. However, ANM is also related to a number of socioeconomic, lifestyle, dietary factors, and other proxies for overall health that may confound these associations. We investigated the causal association of ANM with these clinical outcomes using the principles of Mendelian randomization (MR) combined with a study design that ensured that all participants and outcomes analyzed were restricted to post-menopausal females. We first confirmed associations in the direction expected through observational analysis in both the Women\u2019s Health Initiative (WHI) and the UK Biobank (UKB) before conducting a one-sample MR analysis in these same two cohorts. We further analyzed and integrated several additional datasets of post-menopausal women using a two-sample MR design. We used up to 55 genetic variants previously discovered to be associated with ANM as our instrumental variable. We found that a five year increase in ANM was causally associated with a decreased risk of osteoporosis (OR=0.81 [0.69, 0.95]) and fractures (OR=0.73 [0.60, 0.88]) as well as an increased risk of lung cancer (OR=1.34 [1.05, 1.71]). Other associations including atherosclerosis related outcomes were null. Our study confirms that the known decline in bone density with menopause causally translates to the clinical outcomes of fracture and diagnosed osteoporosis. Additionally, this is the first causal epidemiologic analysis to our knowledge to find an increased risk of lung cancer with ANM. This increased risk is consistent with both molecular and clinical epidemiologic studies that suggest that growth of lung tumors may be in part dependent on estrogen. Randomized controlled trials to test for a beneficial effect of anti-estrogen therapies in the prevention or treatment of lung cancer should be considered if additional MR studies are confirmatory.","Projection neurons (PNs) in the mammalian olfactory bulb (OB) receive direct input from the nose and project to diverse cortical and subcortical areas. Morphological and physiological studies have highlighted functional heterogeneity, yet no molecular markers have been described that delineate PN subtypes. Here, we used viral injections into olfactory cortex and fluorescent nucleus sorting to enrich PNs for high-throughput single nucleus and bulk RNA deep sequencing. Transcriptome analysis and RNA in situ hybridization identified three mitral and five tufted cell populations with characteristic transcription factor network topology and cell adhesion and excitability-related gene expression. Finally, by integrating bulk and snRNA-seq data we propose that different mitral cell populations selectively project to different regions of olfactory cortex. Together, we have identified potential molecular and gene regulatory mechanisms underlying PN diversity and provide new molecular entry points into studying the diverse functional roles of mitral and tufted cell subtypes.","While it is well established that the rate of COVID-19 infections can be suppressed by social distancing, environmental effects may also affect it. We consider the hypothesis that natural Ultra-Violet (UV) light is reducing COVID-19 infections by enhancing human immunity through increasing levels of Vitamin-D and Nitric Oxide or by suppressing the virus itself. We focus on the United Kingdom (UK), by examining daily COVID-19 infections (F) and UV Index (UVI) data from 23 March 2020 to 10 March 2021. We find an intriguing empirical anti-correlation between log10(F) and log10(UVI) with a correlation coefficient of \u22120.934 from 11 May 2020 (when the first UK lockdown ended) to 10 March 2021. The anti-correlation may reflect causation with other factors which are correlated with the UVI. We advocate that UVI should be added as a parameter in modelling the pattern of COVID-19 infections and deaths. We started quantifying such correlations in other countries and regions.","Introduction Vitamin D level has profound clinical implications but there is dilemma of optimal vitamin D cut off level among Bangladeshi population as well in many parts of the world. This study aimed to determine the optimal level of vitamin D in relation to intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and serum calcium in apparently healthy adult volunteer.","Background Nations are imposing unprecedented measures at large-scale to contain the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. Recent studies indicate that measures such as lockdowns may have slowed down the growth of COVID-19. However, in addition to substantial economic and social costs, these measures also limit the exposure to Ultraviolet-B radiation (UVB). Emerging observational evidence indicate the protective role of UVB and vitamin D in reducing the severity and mortality of COVID-19 deaths. In this observational study, we empirically outline the independent protective roles of lockdown and UVB exposure as measured by ultraviolet index (UVI), whilst also examining whether the severity of lockdown is associated with a reduction in the protective role.","Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in human populations and has been linked to immune dysfunction. Here we explored the effects of cholecalciferol supplementation on circulating cytokines in severely vitamin D deficient (blood 25(OH)D3 &lt;&lt; 30 nmol/L) adolescents aged 12-15 from Mongolia. The study included 28 children receiving 800 IU daily cholecalciferol for 6 months spanning winter and spring, and 30 children receiving placebo during the same period. The levels of 25(OH)D3 were assessed at baseline, three and six months. Twenty-one cytokines were measured in serum at baseline and at six months. The median blood 25(OH)D3 concentration at baseline was 13.7 nmol/L (IQR=10.0-21.7). Supplementation tripled blood 25(OH)D3 levels (p&lt;0.001) and reversed the direction of change for most cytokines (16/21, 86%). Supplementation was associated with elevated interleukin (IL)-6 (p=0.043). The placebo group had reduced MIP-1\u03b1 (p=0.007) and IL-8 (p=0.034) at six months. These findings suggest that cholecalciferol supplementation and seasonality have a measurable impact on circulating cytokines in adolescents, identifying chemokines as potentially important biomarkers of vitamin D status in this population.","Detection of recent natural selection is a challenging problem in population genetics, as standard methods generally integrate over long timescales. Here we introduce the Singleton Density Score (SDS), a powerful measure to infer very recent changes in allele frequencies from contemporary genome sequences. When applied to data from the UK10K Project, SDS reflects allele frequency changes in the ancestors of modern Britons during the past 2,000 years. We see strong signals of selection at lactase and HLA, and in favor of blond hair and blue eyes. Turning to signals of polygenic adaptation we find, remarkably, that recent selection for increased height has driven allele frequency shifts across most of the genome. Moreover, we report suggestive new evidence for polygenic shifts affecting many other complex traits. Our results suggest that polygenic adaptation has played a pervasive role in shaping genotypic and phenotypic variation in modern humans.","Background: Observational studies suggest that dietary and serum calcium are risk factors for prostate cancer. However, such studies suffer from residual confounding (due to unmeasured or imprecisely measured confounders), undermining causal inference. Mendelian randomization uses randomly assigned (hence unconfounded and pre-disease onset) germline genetic variation to proxy for phenotypes and strengthen causal inference in observational studies.","Whole genome sequencing studies applied to large populations or biobanks with extensive phenotyping raise new analytic challenges. The need to consider many variants at a locus or group of genes simultaneously and the potential to study many correlated phenotypes with shared genetic architecture provide opportunities for discovery and inference that are not addressed by the traditional one variant, one phenotype association study. Here, we introduce a Bayesian model comparison approach that we refer to as MRP (Multiple Rare-variants and Phenotypes) for rare-variant association studies that considers correlation, scale, and direction of genetic effects across a group of genetic variants, phenotypes, and studies. The approach requires only summary statistic data. To demonstrate the efficacy of MRP, we apply our method to exome sequencing data (N = 184,698) across 2,019 traits from the UK Biobank, aggregating signals in genes. MRP demonstrates an ability to recover previously-verified signals such as associations between PCSK9 and LDL cholesterol levels. We additionally find MRP effective in conducting meta-analyses in exome data. Notable non-biomarker findings include associations between MC1R and red hair color and skin color, IL17RA and monocyte count, IQGAP2 and mean platelet volume, and JAK2 and platelet count and crit (mass). Finally, we apply MRP in a multi-phenotype setting; after clustering the 35 biomarker phenotypes based on genetic correlation estimates into four clusters, we find that joint analysis of these phenotypes results in substantial power gains for gene-trait associations, such as in TNFRSF13B in one of the clusters containing diabetes and lipid-related traits. Overall, we show that the MRP model comparison approach is able to improve upon useful features from widely-used meta-analysis approaches for rare variant association analyses and prioritize protective modifiers of disease risk.","Alzheimer\u2019s disease is characterized by the presence in the brain of amyloid plaques formed by the aberrant deposition of the amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2). Since many vitamins are dysregulated in this disease, we explored whether these molecules participate in protein homeostasis by modulating A\u03b2 aggregation. By screening 18 fat-soluble and water-soluble vitamins, we found that retinoic acid and \u03b1-tocopherol, two metabolites of vitamin A and vitamin E, respectively, affect A\u03b2 aggregation both in vitro and in a C. elegans model of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. We also show that effects of these two vitamin metabolites in combination can cancel each other out, suggesting that the complex composition of the cellular environment could have a protective role against protein aggregation through the simultaneous presence of aggregation promoters and inhibitors. Taken together, these results indicate that vitamins and their metabolites may be added to the list of components of the quality control system that regulate protein aggregation.","The need for remyelinating drugs is essential for healing important diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). One of the reasons for the lack of this class of therapies is the impossibility to follow remyelination in vivo, which is of utmost importance to perform good clinical trials. Here, we show how the optical coherence tomography (OCT), a cheap and non-invasive technique commonly used in ophthalmology, may be used to follow remyelination in vivo in MS patients. Our pioneer study validates the study of myelin/remyelination in the optic nerve using OCT and reflects what is occurring in non accessible CNS structures, like the spinal cord. For this study we used the oral bioavailable small molecule VP3.15, confirming its therapeutical potential as neuroprotective, antinflammatory and remyelinating drug for MS. Altogether, our present results confirm the usefulness of OCT to monitor the effectivity of remyelinating therapies in vivo and underscore the relevance of VP3.15 as potential disease modifying drug for MS therapy.","Background Humans take vitamin D supplements to reduce risk of vitamin D deficiency and reduce the risk of osteoporosis. However, it is unclear how dietary super-doses (10,000x greater than requirement) can affect vitamin D status in aged animals. Aged laying hens could be a model to compare with women in peri- or postmenopausal stages of life. The hens\u2019 bone health is physiologically taxed from egg production and they are highly susceptible to osteoporosis.","Early life stress of an animal often results in changes in gene expression that correspond with changes in their adult phenotype. In the nematode C. elegans, starvation during early larval stages promotes entry into a non-feeding, stress-resistant stage named dauer until environmental conditions improve. Here we show that the endocrine signaling attributed to the somatic aging pathways in C. elegans adults lacking a functional germline also regulate the reproductive phenotypes of adults that have experienced dauer as a result of early life starvation. Postdauer adults modulate their fatty acid metabolism in order to re-allocate fat reserves in a manner benefitting their progeny at the expense of the parental somatic fat reservoir. Our results also show that the metabolic plasticity in postdauer animals and the inheritance of ancestral starvation memory in the progeny are a result of crosstalk between somatic and reproductive tissues mediated by the HRDE-1 nuclear RNAi Argonaute.","The haplotypes of a beneficial allele carry information about its history that can shed light on its age and putative cause for its increase in frequency. Specifically, the signature of an allele\u2019s age is contained in the pattern of local ancestry that mutation and recombination impose on its haplotypic background. We provide a method to exploit this pattern and infer the time to the common ancestor of a positively selected allele following a rapid increase in frequency. We do so using a hidden Markov model which leverages the length distribution of the shared ancestral haplotype, the accumulation of derived mutations on the ancestral background, and the surrounding background haplotype diversity. Using simulations, we demonstrate how the inclusion of information from both mutation and recombination events increases accuracy relative to approaches that only consider a single type of event. We also show the behavior of the estimator in cases where data do not conform to model assumptions, and provide some diagnostics for assessing and improving inference. Using the method, we analyze population-specific patterns in the 1000 Genomes Project data to provide a global perspective on the timing of adaptation for several variants which show evidence of recent selection and functional relevance to diet, skin pigmentation, and morphology in humans.","Background Many studies were carried out to investigate the relationship between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene with obesity. However, little is known about the role of VDR gene polymorphism with obesity in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Therefore, we aimed to investigate VDR gene TaqI, ApaI and FokI SNPs in overweight/obese HD patients.","Background The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 seemed to affect locations in the northern hemisphere most severely appearing to overlap with the pattern of seasonal vitamin D deficiency. Integrating available knowledge, we hypothesised that vitamin D status could play a causal role in COVID-19 outcomes.","Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been widely used to identify brain regions linked to critical functions, such as language and vision, and to detect tumors, strokes, brain injuries, and diseases. It is now known that large sample sizes are necessary for fMRI studies to detect small effect sizes and produce reproducible results. Here we report a systematic association analysis of 647 traits with imaging features extracted from resting-state and task-evoked fMRI data of more than 40,000 UK Biobank participants. We used a parcellation-based approach to generate 64,620 functional connectivity measures to reveal fine-grained details about cerebral cortex functional architectures. The difference between functional organizations at rest and during task has been quantified, and we have prioritized important brain regions and networks associated with a variety of human traits and clinical outcomes. For example, depression was most strongly associated with decreased connectivity in the somatomotor network. We have made our results publicly available and developed a browser framework to facilitate exploration of brain function-trait association results (http://165.227.92.206/).","Background The function of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) in host defense against pathogens, especially Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is poorly understood. To investigate the role of TLR2 during mycobacterial infection, we analyzed the response of tlr2 zebrafish mutant larvae to infection with Mycobacterium marinum (Mm), a close relative to Mtb, as a model for tuberculosis. We measured infection burdens and transcriptome responses using RNA deep sequencing in mutant and control larvae.","Background Several studies have suggested the positive impact of vitamin D on patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. This systematic review aims to evaluate the effects of vitamin D supplementation on clinical outcomes and mortality rate of COVID-19 patients.","Context: Outdoor temperature and bright sunlight may directly and/or indirectly modulate systemic metabolism.","Background Recent meta-analyses concluded that vitamin D supplementation can prevent acute respiratory infection (ARI). However, the findings were heavily influenced by results from two arms of a six-arm cluster-randomised trial that were analysed without accounting for the cluster trial design. We have used publicly available data to provide results from the remaining four unpublished trial arms and to reanalyse the meta-analyses, accounting for the cluster trial design.","Background Evidence supporting the role of vitamin D in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic remains controversial.","The organic anion transporter Adenosine triphosphate Binding Cassette subfamily C member 1 (ABCC1), also known as MRP1, has been demonstrated in murine models of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) to export amyloid beta (Abeta) from the endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier to the periphery, and that pharmaceutical activation of ABCC1 can reduce amyloid plaque deposition in the brain. Here, we show that ABCC1 is not only capable of exporting Abeta from the cytoplasm of human cells, but also that it\u2019s overexpression significantly reduces Abeta production and increases the ratio of alpha- versus beta-secretase mediated cleavage of the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP), likely via indirect modulation of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-secretase activity.","Background Low and deficient levels of vitamin A are common in low and middle income countries where tuberculosis burden is high. We assessed the impact of baseline levels of vitamins A and carotenoids on TB disease risk.","The UK Biobank (UKB) represents an unprecedented population-based study of 502,543 participants with detailed phenotypic data and linkage to medical records. While the release of genotyping array data for this cohort has bolstered genomic discovery for common variants, the contribution of rare variants to this broad phenotype collection remains relatively unknown. Here, we use exome sequencing data from 177,882 UKB participants to evaluate the association between rare protein-coding variants with 10,533 binary and 1,419 quantitative phenotypes. We performed both a variant-level phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) and a gene-level collapsing analysis-based PheWAS tailored to detecting the aggregate contribution of rare variants. The latter revealed 911 statistically significant gene-phenotype relationships, with a median odds ratio of 15.7 for binary traits. Among the binary trait associations identified using collapsing analysis, 83% were undetectable using single variant association tests, emphasizing the power of collapsing analysis to detect signal in the setting of high allelic heterogeneity. As a whole, these genotype-phenotype associations were significantly enriched for loss-of-function mediated traits and currently approved drug targets. Using these results, we summarise the contribution of rare variants to common diseases in the context of the UKB phenome and provide an example of how novel gene-phenotype associations can aid in therapeutic target prioritisation.","Lipids are essential components of bacterial membranes and phages are quasi-ubiquitous in bacteria. Both are crucial mediators of bacteria-host interactions. In the major pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, two common prophages, \u03d511.1 and \u03d513, are preferentially integrated in lipase genes, respectively encoding Geh, a triglyceride lipase, and Hlb, a sphingomyelinase. Here we report how prophage status, and consequently lipase availability, impacts S. aureus metabolism of environmental lipids, and overall bacterial fitness. The fatty acid kinase subunit FakB1, known to promote saturated fatty acid incorporation, also facilitates incorporation of unsaturated fatty acids released from triglycerides by Geh; this process occurs only when \u03d511.1 is absent. Geh and Hlb lipase products compete for FakB1, and interference by prophage integration changes the outcome of this competition. Our findings could explain the selective advantage of prophage conservation, as a means of modulating bacterial membrane composition and preventing toxicity of environmental lipids. \u03d513 lysogeny also impaired the bacterial capacity to escape antibiotic inhibitors of FASII (fatty acid synthesis). We suggest that testing new therapeutics against S. aureus should consider prophage status and environmental lipids for accurate prediction of efficiency.","Vitamin D is a pro-hormone, essential for musculo-skeletal health, normal immune system, and numerous other body functions. Vitamin D deficiency is considered a risk factor in many conditions, and there is growing evidence of its potential role in the severity of COVID-19 outcomes. However, an alarmingly high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is reported in many regions, and vitamin D supplementation is commonly recommended, particularly during wintertime. To reduce the risk for vitamin D deficiency in the Slovenian population during the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted mass media intervention with an educational campaign. The objective of this study was to investigate vitamin D supplementation practices in Slovenia before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to determine the effects of the educational intervention on supplementation practices. Two data collections were conducted using an online panel with quota sampling for age, sex, and geographical location. A pre-intervention (N=602, April 2020) and post-intervention (N=606) sampling were done during the first and second COVID-19 lockdown, respectively. We also focused on the identification of different factors connected to vitamin D supplementation, with a particular emphasis on vitamin D-related knowledge. Study results showed significant changes in vitamin D supplementation in the population. Penetration of the supplementation increased from 33% in April to 56% in December 2020. The median daily vitamin D intake in supplement users was 25 \u00b5g, with about 95% of supplement users taking safe intake levels below 100 \u00b5g/daily. Vitamin D-related knowledge (particularly about dietary sources of vitamin D, the health-related impact of vitamin D, and the prevalence of deficiency) was identified as a key independent predictor of vitamin D supplementation. Based on the study findings, we prepared recommendations, which will enable the development of effective awareness campaigns for increasing supplementation of vitamin D.","Participation in a genetic study likely has a genetic component. Identifying such component is difficult as we cannot compare genetic information of participants with non-participants directly, the latter being unavailable. Here, we show that alleles that are more common in participants than non-participants would be further enriched in genetic segments shared by two related participants. Genome-wide analysis was performed by comparing allele frequencies in shared and not-shared genetic segments of first-degree relative pairs of the UK Biobank. A polygenic score constructed from that analysis, in non-overlapping samples, is associated with educational attainment (P = 2.1 \u00d7 10\u221252), body mass index (P = 1.5 \u00d7 10\u221219), and participation in a dietary study (P = 6.9 \u00d7 10\u221221). Further analysis shows that inclination to participate is a behavioural trait in its own right, and not simply a consequence of other established phenotypes. Understanding the basis of this trait is important for data analyses and the design of future surveys, genetic or otherwise.","Background A 2017 meta-analysis of data from 25 randomised controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation for the prevention of acute respiratory infections revealed a protective effect of the intervention. Since then, 20 new RCTs have been completed.","As humans dispersed out of Africa, they adapted to new environmental challenges including changes in exposure to mutagenic solar radiation. Humans in temperate latitudes have acquired light skin that is relatively transparent to ultraviolet light, and some evidence suggests that their DNA damage response pathways have also experienced local adaptation. This raises the possibility that different populations have experienced different selective pressures affecting genome integrity. Here, I present evidence that the rate of a particular mutation type has recently increased in the European population, rising in frequency by 50% during the 40,000\u201380,000 years since Europeans began diverging from Asians. A comparison of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) private to Africa, Asia, and Europe in the 1000 Genomes data reveals that private European variation is enriched for the transition 5\u2019-TCC-3\u2019\u21925\u2019-TTC-3\u2019. Although it is not clear whether UV played a causal role in the changing the European mutational spectrum, 5\u2019-TCC-3\u2019\u21925\u2019-TTC-3\u2019 is known to be the most common somatic mutation present in melanoma skin cancers, as well as the mutation most frequently induced in vitro by UV. Regardless of its causality, this change indicates that DNA replication fidelity has not remained stable even since the origin of modern humans and might have changed numerous times during our recent evolutionary history.","Tuberculosis (TB) has become a leading cause of death worldwide, which is largely attributed to the difficulties in diagnosis and treatment of TB patients. Exosomes carrying RNA, particularly miRNA, have been indicated their functional and diagnostic potential in diseases, including tuberculosis (TB). In the present study, we performed RNA-seq based analysis on exosomal miRNA profiles for clinical specimens of healthy controls (HC), active tuberculosis (TB) and latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). We identified many distinct up-regulated and down-regulated differentially expressed miRNA and further screened top 20 in each compared groups which might provide a potential panel for differentiation of HC, LTBI, and TB. We classified all the differentially expressed miRNAs into six expression patterns and identified three persistently up-regulated miRNA (hsa-miR-140-3p, hsa-miR-3184-5p and hsa-miR-423-3p) as potential markers during TB progression. Combined with our previously detected exsomal mRNA, we screened the genes overlapped with predicted mRNA targets of differentially expressed miRNA and analyzed their involvement in Biological Process, indicating a decreased signaling transduction and increased cell death in LTBI and TB. Our results indicate the selective packaging of RNA cargoes into exosomes under different stages of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and facilitate further study of TB pathogenesis and development.","Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with multiple diseases, but the causal relevance and underlying processes are not fully understood. Elucidating the mechanisms of action of drug treatments in humans is challenging, but application of functional genomic approaches in randomised trials may afford an opportunity to systematically assess molecular responses to treatments. In the Biochemical Efficacy and Safety Trial of Vitamin D (BEST-D), 305 community-dwelling individuals aged over 65 years were randomly allocated to treatment with vitamin D34000 IU, 2000 IU or placebo daily for 12 months. Genome-wide genotypes at baseline, and transcriptome and plasma levels of cytokines (IFN-\u03b3, IL-10, IL-8, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1) at baseline and after 12 months, were measured. The trial had &gt;90% power to detect a 2-fold change in gene expression. Allocation to vitamin D for 12-months was associated with 2-fold higher plasma levels of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25[OH]D), but had no significant effect on whole-blood gene expression (FDR &lt;5%) or on plasma levels of cytokines compared with placebo. In pre-specified analysis, rs7041 (intron variant, GC) had a significant effect on circulating levels of 25(OH)D in the low dose but not on the placebo or high dose vitamin D regimen. A gene expression quantitative trait locus analysis (eQTL) demonstrated evidence of 31,568 cis-eQTLs (unique SNP-probe pairs) among individuals at baseline and 34,254 after supplementation for 12 months (any dose), but had no significant effect on cis-eQTLs specific to vitamin D supplementation. The trial demonstrates the feasibility of application of functional genomics approaches in randomised trials to assess the effects of vitamin D on immune function.","The white-blotched river stingray (Potamotrygon leopoldi) is a cartilaginous fish native to the Xingu River, a tributary of the Amazon River system. It possesses a lot of unique biological features such as disc-like body shape, bizarre color pattern and living in freshwater habitat while most stingrays and their close relatives are sea dwellers. As a member of the Potamotrygonidae family, P. leopoldi bears evolutionary signification in fish phylogeny, niche adaptation and skeleton formation. In this study, we present its draft genome of 4.11 Gb comprised of 16,227 contigs and 13,238 scaffolds, which has contig N50 of 3,937 kilobases and scaffold N50 of 5,675 kilobases in size. Our analysis shows that P. leopoldi is a slow-evolving fish, diverged from elephant shark about 96 million years ago. We find that two gene families related to immune system, immunoglobulin heavy constant delta genes, and T-cell receptor alpha/delta variable genes, stand out expanded in P. leopoldi only, suggesting robustness in response to freshwater pathogens in adapting novel environments. We also identified the Hox gene clusters in P. leopoldi and discovered that seven Hox genes shared by five representative fishes are missing in P. leopoldi. The RNA-seq data from P. leopoldi and other three fish species demonstrate that fishes have a more diversified tissue expression spectrum as compared to the corresponding mammalian data. Our functional studies suggest that the lack of genes encoding vitamin D-binding protein in cartilaginous (both P. leopoldi and Callorhinchus milii) fishes could partly explain the absence of hard bone in their endoskeleton. Overall, this genome resource provides new insights into the niche-adaptation, body plan and skeleton formation of P. leopoldi as well as the genome evolution in cartilaginous fish.","Interest in the genetic basis of variation in skin pigmentation in Native American populations led us to seek indigenous populations of the Western Hemisphere with African and minimal European admixture to study the effect of Native American ancestry on skin color. Admixture analysis from DNA collected from 458 individuals in the Kalinago territory of the Commonwealth of Dominica showed shared ancestry with East Asians at K=3 and 55% Native American, 32% African, and 11% European ancestry at K=6, the highest Native American ancestry of Caribbean populations. Skin pigmentation was 20 to 80 melanin units, averaging 46. Three albino individuals were homozygous for multi-nucleotide polymorphism OCA2NW273KV of African origin, whose population allele frequency was 0.03 and single allele effect size was \u22128 melanin units. Hypopigmenting allele frequencies for SLC24A5A111T and SLC45A2L374F were 0.14 and 0.05, whose single allele effect sizes were \u22126 and \u22123, respectively. Skin color plots of individuals lacking known hypopigmenting alleles suggests that Native American Ancestry reduced pigmentation by more than 20 melanin units (low and high estimates 21.8 and 28.5). Shared ancestry with East Asians at K=3 suggests potential sharing of one or more pigmentation alleles.","Introduction Vitamin D supplements are recommended for elderly care home residents with little sunlight exposure. However, their use in care homes is limited and vitamin D deficiency in residents is widespread. This study aimed to understand perceived responsibility for the vitamin D status of residents and the determinants of current practice around supplementation.","A variety of cat breeds have been developed via novelty selection on aesthetic, dermatological traits, such as coat colors and fur types. A recently developed breed, the lykoi, was bred from cats with a sparse hair coat with roaning, implying full color and all white hairs. The lykoi phenotype is a form of hypotrichia, presenting as significant reduction in the average numbers of follicles per hair follicle group as compared to domestic shorthair cats, a mild to severe perifollicular to mural lymphocytic infiltration in 77% of observed hair follicle groups, and the follicles are often miniaturized, dilated, and dysplastic. Whole genome sequencing was conducted on a single lykoi cat that was a cross between two independently ascertained lineages. Comparison to the 99 Lives dataset of 194 non-lykoi cats suggested two variants in the cat homolog for Hairless (HR: lysine demethylase and nuclear receptor corepressor) as candidate causal variants. The lykoi cat was a compound heterozygote for two loss of function variants in HR, an exon 3 c.1255_1256dupGT (chrB1:36040783), which should produce a stop codon at amino acid 420 (p.Gln420Serfs*100) and, an exon 18 c.3389insGACA (chrB1:36051555), which should produce a stop codon at amino acid position 1130 (p.Ser1130Argfs*29). Ascertainment of 14 additional cats from founder lineages from Canada, France and different areas of the USA identified four additional loss of function HR variants likely causing the highly similar phenotypic hair coat across the diverse cats. The novel variants in HR for cat hypotrichia can now be established between minor differences in the phenotypic presentations.","Background Well-established risk factors for fertility problems such as smoking have been included in fertility awareness efforts globally. However, these efforts neglect risks that women in low and middle-income countries (LMIC) face.","Background Mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with molecular phenotypes is a powerful approach for identifying the genes and molecular mechanisms underlying human traits and diseases. How the genetic architecture of molecular traits varies across human populations, however, has been less explored. To better understand the genetics of gene regulation in East Africans, we perform expression and splicing QTL mapping in whole blood from a cohort of 162 diverse Africans from Ethiopia and Tanzania. We assess replication of these QTLs in cohorts of predominantly European ancestry and identify candidate genes under selection in human populations.","Maternal nutritional status influences fetal development and long-term risk for adult non-communicable diseases. The underlying mechanisms of these long-term effects remain poorly understood. We examined whether maternal biomarkers for metabolism and inflammation during pregnancy were associated with child biomarkers in the Supplementation with Multiple Micronutrients Intervention Trial (SUMMIT, ISRCTN34151616) in Lombok, Indonesia wherein archived blood specimens and relevant data were available from pregnant women and their children 9-12 years after birth. Forty-four mother-child dyads comprising 132 specimens were analyzed by multiplex microbead immunoassays to quantify vitamin D-binding protein (D), adiponectin (A), retinol-binding protein 4 (R), C-reactive protein (C), and leptin (L). Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed distinct variance patterns, i.e. principal components (PC), for baseline pregnancy bp.pc1.D\u2193A\u2193R\u2193 and bp.pc2.C\u2193L\u2191; combined follow-up and post-partum dp-pp.pc1.D\u2191\u2193A\u2191R\u2191\u2193L\u2193 and dp-pp.pc2.A\u2191C\u2191L\u2191; and children ch.pc1.D\u2191R\u2191C\u2191 and ch.pc2.D\u2193A\u2191L\u2191. Maternal multiple micronutrient (MMN) supplementation modified the association between baseline maternal bp.pc2.C\u2193L\u2191 and post-supplementation maternal dp-pp.pc2.A\u2193C\u2191L\u2191 (p=0.022). Significant associations were found between maternal dp-pp.pc2.A\u2191C\u2191L\u2191 and increased child \u2018s ch.pc1.D\u2191R\u2191C\u2191 (p=0.036), and decreased child \u2018s BMI z-score (BMIZ) (p=0.022); and between maternal dp-pp.pc1.D\u2191\u2193A\u2191R\u2191\u2193L\u2191 and increased child \u2018s BMIZ (p=0.036). Child \u2018s ch.pc1.D\u2191R\u2191C\u2191 was associated with decreased birth weight (p=0.036), and increased child\u2019s BMIZ (p=0.002); and ch.pc2.D\u2193A\u2191L\u2191 was associated with increased child\u2019s BMIZ (p=0.005), decreased maternal height (p=0.030) and girls (p=0.002). Elevated adiponectin and leptin pattern in pregnancy was associated with increased C-reactive protein and vitamin A and D binding proteins pattern in children, suggesting biomarkers acting in concert may be more important than single biomarker effects. Patterns in pregnancy proximal to birth were more associated with child status, and child patterns were most frequently associated with child status, particularly child BMI. Although MMN supplementation and certain maternal biomarker patterns have effects on metabolism and inflammation in pregnancy and in the child, nevertheless, nutrition conditions after birth may have a greater impact.","Determining the forces that shape diversity in host-associated bacterial communities is critical to understanding the evolution and maintenance of metaorganisms. To gain deeper understanding of the role of host genetics in shaping gut microbial traits, we employed a powerful genetic mapping approach using inbred lines derived from the hybrid zone of two incipient house mouse species. Further, we uniquely performed our analysis on microbial traits measured at the gut mucosal interface, which is in more direct contact with host cells and the immune system. A high number of mucosa-associated bacterial taxa have significant heritability estimates; heritabilities are greater for 16S rRNA transcript-compared to gene copy-based traits, and interestingly, are positively correlated with cospeciation rate estimates. Genomewide association mapping identifies 443 loci influencing 123 taxa, with narrow genomic intervals pinpointing promising candidate genes and pathways. Importantly, we identified an enrichment of candidate genes associated with several human diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, and functional categories including innate immunity and G-protein-coupled receptors. These results highlight key features of the genetic architecture of mammalian host-microbe interactions and how they diverge as new species form.","Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) signaling pathways have well established roles in skeletal development, with essential functions in both chondrogenesis and osteogenesis. In mice, previous conditional knockout studies suggested distinct roles for FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1) signaling at different stages of osteogenesis and a role for FGFR2 in osteoblast maturation. However, the potential for redundancy among FGFRs and the mechanisms and consequences of stage-specific osteoblast lineage regulation were not addressed. Here, we conditionally inactivate Fgfr1 and Fgfr2 in mature osteoblasts with an Osteocalcin-Cre or Dentin matrix protein 1-CreER driver. We find that young mice lacking both receptors or only FGFR1 are phenotypically normal. However, after 6 weeks of age these Fgfr1/Fgfr2 double- and Fgfr1 single-conditional knockout mice develop a high bone mass phenotype with increased periosteal apposition, increased endocortical woven bone with increased porosity, and biomechanical properties that reflect increased bone mass but impaired material properties. Histopathological and gene expression analyses show that this phenotype is preceded by a striking loss of osteocytes, and gradual activation of the Wnt/\u03b2Catenin signaling pathway. These data identify a role for FGFR1 signaling in mature osteoblasts/osteocytes that is required for osteocyte survival during postnatal bone growth.","Aspergillus species are ubiquitous environmental molds, the spores of which are inhaled daily by most humans. Immunocompromised hosts can develop an invasive infection resulting in high mortality. There is, therefore, a pressing need for host-centric therapeutics for this infection. To address this need, we created a multi-scale computational model of the infection, focused on its interaction with the innate immune system and iron, a critical nutrient for the pathogen. The model, parameterized using published data, was found to recapitulate a wide range of biological features and was experimentally validated in vivo. Conidial swelling was identified as critical in fungal strains with high growth, whereas the siderophore secretion rate is an essential prerequisite for establishment of the infection in low-growth strains. In immunocompetent hosts, high growth, high swelling probability, and impaired leukocyte activation lead to a high conidial germination rate. Similarly, in neutropenic mice, high fungal growth was achieved through synergy between high growth rate, high swelling probability, slow leukocyte activation, and high siderophore secretion. In summary, the model reveals a small set of parameters related to fungal growth, iron acquisition, and leukocyte activation as key determinants of the fate of the infection.","The aim of this study was to explore how the relationship between vitamin D and COVID-19 has been represented on the social media site Twitter. NCapture was used to collect textual Tweets on a weekly basis for three months during the pandemic. In total, 21,140 Tweets containing the keywords \u201cvitamin D\u201d and \u201cCOVID\u201d were collected and imported to NVivo12. An inductive thematic analysis was carried out on the Tweets collected on the first (12/2/2021) and last week (21/5/2021) of the recording period to identify themes and subthemes. Quality control of the coding was conducted on a sample of the dataset (20%). Data were also compared to the \u201cground truth\u201d to explore the accuracy of media outputs. The four main themes identified were \u201cassociation of vitamin D with COVID-19\u201d, \u201cpolitically informed views\u201d, \u201cvitamin D deficiency\u201d and \u201cvitamin D sources\u201d. When compared to the ground truth, the majority of information relating to the key findings was \u2018incorrect\u2019 for all of the findings. This study contributes to the area of research by highlighting the extent of the issue social media sites face with health-related misinformation. In the context of COVID-19, it is important that sites such as Twitter improve their existing misinformation policies, as misinformation can be detrimental in disease prevention.","Objective The association between vitamin D deficiency and multiple sclerosis (MS) is well described. We set out to use remote sampling to ascertain vitamin D status and vitamin D supplementation in a cross-sectional study of people with MS across the UK.","Identifying significant biological relationships or patterns is central to many metagenomic studies. Methods that estimate association networks have been proposed for this purpose, but they assume that associations are static, neglecting the fact that relationships in a microbial ecosystem may vary with changes in environmental factors, which can result in inaccurate estimations. We propose a computational model, k-Lognormal-Dirichlet-Multinomial model (kLDM), which estimates multiple association networks that correspond to specific environmental conditions according to values of environmental factors (EFs), and simultaneously infers microbe-microbe and environmental factor-microbe associations for each network. We showed the effectiveness of kLDM on synthetic data, a colorectal cancer dataset, as well as the TARA Oceans and American Gut project datasets. The results showed that the widely used Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient (SCC) performed much worse than other methods, indicating the importance of separating samples by environmental conditions. We compared cancer fecal samples with cancer-free samples, and our estimation showed fewer associations among microbes but stronger associations between specific bacteria such as five colorectal cancer (CRC)-associated OTUs, indicating gut microbe translocation in cancer patients. Some environmental-factor-dependent associations were found within marine eukaryotic community, and gut microbial heterogeneity of irritable bowel disease (IBD) patients was detected. Results demonstrated that kLDM could successfully unravel the underlying biological associations. In summary, our study presents a computational framework that can elucidate the complex associations within microbial ecosystems. The kLDM program, R, and python scripts, together with all experimental datasets are all accessible at Github (https://github.com/tinglab/kLDM.git).","It is known that the nucleotide context surrounding stop codons significantly affects the efficiency of translation termination. In eukaryotes, various 3\u2032 contexts have been described that are unfavourable for translation termination; however, the exact molecular mechanism that mediates their effect remains unknown. In this study, we used a reconstituted mammalian translation system to examine the efficiency of stop codons in different contexts, including several previously described weak 3\u2032 stop codon contexts. Our results revealed that ribosomes can independently recognize certain contexts and ignore stop codons that are followed by these sequences. Moreover, the efficiency of translation termination at the weak 3\u2032 contexts was almost equal to the one at the standard context. We propose that weak 3\u2032 contexts interact with the 18S rRNA provoking a conformational change in the U-turn-like structure of the stop codon in the A site of ribosome. This change makes incorporation of the near-cognate tRNA more preferable than recognition of the stop codon by the release factors and increases readthrough.","Introduction Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Surgery (RYGB) reduces albuminuria and the long-term incidence of end-stage renal disease in patients with obesity and diabetes. Preclinical modelling in experimental diabetic kidney disease (DKD) demonstrates that improvements in glomerular structure likely underpin these findings.","Objective To explore the correlation between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and tic disorders (TDs) in Chinese children. Methods We selected 2960 children with TD and 2665 healthy controls, aged 5-14 years, from the Department of Neurology of the Shanghai Children's Hospital. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and degrees of vitamin D deficiency were compared between patients with TD and healthy children. Results The mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level in the TD group was significantly lower than that in the control group (P &lt; 0.001). The proportion of patients with 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency in the TD group was significantly higher than that in the control group. However, there was no correlation between 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency and the severity of TD. In addition, for age-wise comparison, mean levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and its deficiency in the TD group were the most significant in children over 9 years of age. Conclusion There is a correlation between 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency and TD in Chinese children, but not between 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency and the severity of TD. There was a correlation between age and deficiency of 25-hydroxyvitamin D; this deficiency was most pronounced among those over the age of 9 years. ","Human pregnancy requires the coordinated function of multiple tissues in both mother and fetus and has evolved in concert with major human adaptations. As a result, pregnancy-associated phenotypes and related disorders are genetically complex and have likely been sculpted by diverse evolutionary forces. However, there is no framework to comprehensively evaluate how these traits evolved or to explore the relationship of evolutionary signatures on trait-associated genetic variants to molecular function. Here we develop an approach to test for signatures of diverse evolutionary forces, including multiple types of selection, and apply it to genomic regions associated with spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB), a complex disorder of global health concern. We find that sPTB-associated regions harbor diverse evolutionary signatures including evolutionary sequence conservation (consistent with the action of negative selection), excess population differentiation (local adaptation), accelerated evolution (positive selection), and balanced polymorphism (balancing selection). Furthermore, these genomic regions show diverse functional characteristics which enables us to use evolutionary and molecular lines of evidence to develop hypotheses about how these genomic regions contribute to sPTB risk. In summary, we introduce an approach for inferring the spectrum of evolutionary forces acting on genomic regions associated with complex disorders. When applied to sPTB-associated genomic regions, this approach both improves our understanding of the potential roles of these regions in pathology and illuminates the mosaic nature of evolutionary forces acting on genomic regions associated with sPTB.","Background Prospective population-based studies investigating multiple determinants of pre-vaccination antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 are lacking.","In this study, we perform a full genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify statistically significantly associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with three red blood cell (RBC) components and follow it with two independent PheWASs to examine associations between phenotypic data (case-control status of diagnoses or disease), significant SNPs, and RBC component levels. We first identified associations between the three RBC components: mean platelet volume (MPV), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and platelet counts (PC), and the genotypes of approximately 500,000 SNPs on the Illumina Infimum\u00ae DNA Human OmniExpress-24 BeadChip using a single cohort of 4,700 Northern Nevadans. Twenty-one SNPs in five major genomic regions were found to be statistically significantly associated with MPV, two regions with MCV, and one region with PC, with p&lt;5x10-8. Twenty-nine SNPs and nine chromosomal regions were identified in 30 previous GWASs, with effect sizes of similar magnitude and direction as found in our cohort. The two strongest associations were SNP rs1354034 with MPV (p=2.4x10-13) and rs855791 with MCV (p=5.2x10-12). We then examined possible associations between these significant SNPs and incidence of 1,488 phenotype groups mapped from International Classification of Disease version 9 and 10 (ICD9 and ICD10) codes collected in the extensive electronic health record (EHR) database associated with Healthy Nevada Project consented participants. Further leveraging data collected in the EHR, we performed an additional PheWAS to identify associations between continuous red blood cell (RBC) component measures and incidence of specific diagnoses. The first PheWAS illuminated whether SNPs associated with RBC components in our cohort were linked with other hematologic phenotypic diagnoses or diagnoses of other nature. Although no SNPs from our GWAS were identified as strongly associated to other phenotypic components, a number of associations were identified with p-values ranging between 1x10-3 and 1x10-4 with traits such as respiratory failure, sleep disorders, hypoglycemia, hyperglyceridemia, GERD and IBS. The second PheWAS examined possible phenotypic predictors of abnormal RBC component measures: a number of hematologic phenotypes such as thrombocytopenia, anemias, hemoglobinopathies and pancytopenia were found to be strongly associated to RBC component measures; additional phenotypes such as (morbid) obesity, malaise and fatigue, alcoholism, and cirrhosis were also identified to be possible predictors of RBC component measures.","A potential protective role of vitamin D serum levels on overall adverse outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 on populations had been suggested previously based upon single-point cross-sectional analysis of 8 April 2020 data from 20 European countries assuming comparable underlying confounding variables for these populations, at an early stage of the current pandemic. Comparative time-series cross-sectional analysis of the COVID-19 data from 12 March (early pre-peak) to 26 July (late post-peak of infections) 2020 was performed to assess the strength of the assertion. The study subjects included 1,829,634 COVID-19 cases (11.11% of total worldwide) and 179,135 associated deaths (27.45 % of total worldwide) on 26 July 2012. Previously suggested cross-sectional study design and methodology could not consistently and significantly (p-value\u22650.05) support the notion of the potential protective role of the mean serum vitamin D levels of the populations on COVID-19 incidence and mortality. However, the exponential correlative model, as well as alternative simple regression analysis on ln and Log10 transformed COVID-19 data for the time period indicated improved consistently negative covariation with vitamin D levels. Additionally, the later methodology increased the predictive potential for explaining the variability in data [R2 by 1.27-1.96 fold, adjusted-R2 by 1.33-2.47, p-value=0.0457-0.0035, for cases/million; R2 by 1.81-2.67, adjusted-R2 by 2.21-3.74 fold for deaths/million, p-value=0.0049-0.0228). Considering, the established role of vitamin D in immune system functioning randomized well-controlled trials may be suggested to evaluate/assess the potential protective role of vitamin D in reducing the COVID-19 impact on populations.","Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) is associated with a range of cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular diseases in conventional epidemiological studies, but substantial residual confounding may exist. Mendelian randomisation approaches can help control for such confounding. SCALLOP consortium data on 19,195 participants were used to generate an FGF-23 genetic score. Data from 337,448 UK Biobank participants were used to estimate associations between higher genetically-predicted FGF-23 concentration and the odds of any atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (n=26,266 events), of any non-atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (n=12,652), and of non-cardiovascular diseases previously linked to FGF-23. Measurements of carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and left ventricular mass (LVM) were available in a subset. Associations with cardiovascular outcomes were also tested in three large case-control consortia: CARDIOGRAMplusC4D (coronary artery disease, n=181,249 cases), MEGASTROKE (stroke, n=34,217), and HERMES (heart failure, n=47,309). We identified 34 independent variants for circulating FGF-23 which formed a validated genetic score. There were no associations between genetically-predicted FGF-23 and any of the cardiovascular or non-cardiovascular outcomes. In UK Biobank, the odds ratio for any atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease per 1-SD higher genetically-predicted logFGF-23 was 1.03 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.98-1.08), and for any non-atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease was 1.01 (0.94-1.09). The odds ratios in the case-control consortia were 1.00 (0.97-1.03) for coronary artery disease, 1.01 (0.95-1.07) for stroke, and 1.00 (0.95-1.05) for heart failure. In those with imaging, logFGF-23 was not associated with CIMT or LVM index. This suggests that previously reported observational associations of FGF-23 with risk of atherosclerotic and non-atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases are unlikely to be causal.","The ancestor of most teleost fishes underwent a whole-genome duplication event three hundred million years ago. Despite its antiquity, the effects of this event are evident both in the structure of teleost genomes and in how those genes still operate to drive form and function. I describe the inference of a set of shared syntenic regions that survive from the teleost genome duplication (TGD) using eight teleost genomes and the outgroup gar genome (which lacks the TGD). I phylogenetically modeled the resolution of the TGD via shared and independent gene losses, concluding that it was likely an allopolyploidy event due to the biased pattern of these gene losses. Duplicate genes surviving from this duplication in zebrafish are less likely to function in early embryo development than are genes that have returned to single copy. As a result, surviving ohnologs function later in development, and the pattern of which tissues these ohnologs are expressed in and their functions lend support to recent suggestions that the TGD was the source of a morphological innovation in the structure of the teleost retina. Surviving duplicates also appear less likely to be essential than singletons, despite the fact that their single-copy orthologs in mouse are no less essential than other genes. Nonetheless, the surviving duplicates occupy central positions in the zebrafish metabolic network.","Background and objectives Low levels of vitamin D among dark-skinned migrants to northern latitudes and increased risks for associated pathologies illustrate an evolutionary mismatch between an environment of high ultraviolet (UV) radiation to which such migrants are adapted and the low-UV environment to which they migrate. Recently, low levels of vitamin D have also been associated with higher risks for contracting COVID-19. South Asians in the UK have higher risk for low vitamin D levels. In this study, we assessed vitamin D status of British-Bangladeshi migrants compared to white British residents and Bangladeshis still living in Bangladesh (\u2018sedentees\u2019).","Epigenetic clocks are widely used aging biomarkers calculated from DNA methylation data. Unfortunately, measurements for individual CpGs can be surprisingly unreliable due to technical noise, and this may limit the utility of epigenetic clocks. We report that noise produces deviations up to 3 to 9 years between technical replicates for six major epigenetic clocks. The elimination of low-reliability CpGs does not ameliorate this issue. Here, we present a novel computational multi-step solution to address this noise, involving performing principal component analysis on the CpG-level data followed by biological age prediction using principal components as input. This method extracts shared systematic variation in DNAm while minimizing random noise from individual CpGs. Our novel principal-component versions of six clocks show agreement between most technical replicates within 0 to 1.5 years, equivalent or improved prediction of outcomes, and more stable trajectories in longitudinal studies and cell culture. This method entails only one additional step compared to traditional clocks, does not require prior knowledge of CpG reliabilities, and can improve the reliability of any existing or future epigenetic biomarker. The high reliability of principal component-based epigenetic clocks will make them particularly useful for applications in personalized medicine and clinical trials evaluating novel aging interventions.","The role of natural radioactivity in influencing viability of commensal microorganisms, with particular reference to those pertaining to the human microbiota, has not been investigated in detail. The results of experiments culturing a diversified array of microorganims - probiotics - in naturally radioactive mineral water or deuterium-depleted water are here described. Culturing microorganisms in naturally radioactive mineral water yielded one order of magnitude more live microbial cells in comparison with culturing in deuterium-depleted water. Based on these experimental results, a method for co-culturing prebiotic microorganisms (cyanobacteria) that are extremely resistant to the harmful effects of radiations, together with the probiotics mentioned above, is described. The goal of this co-culture in naturally radioactive mineral water is to transfer the information from the radiation-resistant microorganisms to the probiotics whose viability is enhanced by natural radioactivity. Expression of DNA repair genes in cyanobacteria is induced by co-culturing in a medium of carbonated mineral water naturally containing the radioactive isotopes 228U and 226Ra. The culture medium, in addition to naturally radioactive water, contains silica from vegetal origin to enhance horizontal gene transfer. Finally, it is described the transfer of resistance to the harmful effects of radiations to human cells through a Lactococcus phage-encoded protein, ORF252, that is the evolutionary precursor of human proteins involved in DNA repair and cancer protection.","Musculoskeletal conditions, including fractures, can have severe and long-lasting consequences. Higher body mass index in adulthood is widely acknowledged to be protective for most fracture sites, indicated through previous clinical and epidemiological observational research. However, the association between weight and bone health is complex and sources of bias, induced by confounding factors, may have distorted earlier findings. Employing a lifecourse Mendelian randomization (MR) approach by using genetic instruments to separate effects at different life stages, this investigation aims to explore how prepubertal and adult body size independently influence fracture risk in later life.","Psoriasis is characterized by a combination of keratinocyte hyperproliferation and immune cell activation. Immune cell activation requires increased glucose consumption, consequently limiting glucose availability for other cell types like keratinocytes. In psoriasis Hsa-microRNA-31-5p (miR-31) is highly expressed in keratinocytes. Here we show that miR-31 expression in keratinocytes is induced by limited glucose availability and increases survival under limiting glucose conditions, by increasing glutamine metabolism. In addition, miR-31 induced glutamine metabolism results in secretion of specific metabolites (aspartate and glutamate) but also immuno-modulatory factors. We show that this miR-31-induced secretory phenotype is sufficient to induce Th17 cell differentiation, a hallmark of psoriasis. Inhibition of glutaminase (GLS) using CB-839 impedes miR31-induced metabolic rewiring and secretion of immuno-modulatory factors. Concordantly, pharmacological targeting of GLS alleviated psoriasis pathology in a mouse model of psoriasis. Together our data illustrate an emerging concept of metabolic interaction across cell compartments that characterizes disease development, which can be employed to design effective treatment options for disease, as shown here for psoriasis.","Vitamin D regulates the master iron hormone hepcidin, and iron in turn alters vitamin D metabolism. Although vitamin D and iron deficiency are highly prevalent globally little is known about their interactions in Africa. To evaluate associations between vitamin D and iron status we measured markers of iron status, inflammation, malaria parasitemia and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations in 4509 children aged 0.3 months to 8 years living in Kenya, Uganda, Burkina Faso, The Gambia and South Africa. Prevalence of iron deficiency was 35.1%, and preva- lence of vitamin D deficiency was 0.6% and 7.8% as defined by 25(OH)D concentrations of &lt;30 nmol/L and &lt;50 nmol/L respectively. Children with 25(OH)D concentrations of &lt;50 nmol/L had a 98% increased risk of iron deficiency (OR 1.98 [95% CI 1.52, 2.58]) compared to those with 25(OH)D concentrations &gt;75 nmol/L. 25(OH)D concentrations variably influenced individual markers of iron status. Inflammation interacted with 25(OH)D concentrations to predict ferritin levels. The link between vitamin D and iron status should be considered in strategies to manage these nutrient deficiencies in African children.","Vitamin D has a well-established role in skeletal health and is increasingly linked to chronic disease and mortality in humans and companion animals. Despite the clear significance of vitamin D for health and obvious implications for fitness under natural conditions, no longitudinal study has tested whether the circulating concentration of vitamin D is under natural selection in the wild. Here, we show that concentrations of dietary-derived vitamin D2 and endogenously-produced vitamin D3 metabolites are heritable and largely polygenic in a wild population of Soay sheep (Ovis aries). Vitamin D2 status was positively associated with female adult survival, and vitamin D3 status predicted female fecundity in particular, good environment years. Our study provides evidence that vitamin D status has the potential to respond to selection, as well as new insights into how vitamin D metabolism is associated with fitness in the wild.","Background African Americans (AAs) are an admixed population with portions of their genome derived from West Africans and Europeans. In AAs, the proportion of West African ancestry (WAA) can vary widely and may explain the genetic drivers of disease, specifically those that disproportionately affect this understudied population. To examine the relationship between the proportion of WAA and gene expression, we used high dimensional data obtained from AA primary hepatocytes, a tissue important in disease and drug response.","Nuclear receptor related 1 protein (Nurr1/NR4A2) is an orphan nuclear receptor that is considered to function without a canonical ligand-binding pocket. A crystal structure of the Nurr1 ligand-binding domain (LBD) revealed no physical space in the conserved region where other nuclear receptors with solvent accessible apo-protein ligand-binding pockets bind synthetic and natural ligands. Using solution NMR spectroscopy, hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, and molecular dynamics simulations, we show here that the putative canonical ligand-binding pocket in the Nurr1 LBD is dynamic with high solvent accessibility, exchanges between two or more conformations on the microsecond-to-millisecond timescale, and can expand from the collapsed crystalized conformation to allow binding of unsaturated fatty acids. These findings should stimulate future studies to probe the ligandability and druggability of Nurr1 for both endogenous and synthetic ligands, which could lead to new therapeutics for Nurr1-related diseases, including Parkinson\u2019s disease and schizophrenia.","Background Genome wide association studies (GWAS) of specific diseases are central to scientific discovery. Bias from inevitably recruiting only survivors of genetic make-up and disease specific competing risk has not been comprehensively considered.","Background It is clear that in UK healthcare workers, COVID-19 infections and deaths were more likely to be in staff who were of BAME origin. This has led to much speculation about the role of vitamin D in healthcare worker COVID-19 infections. We aimed to determine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in NHS staff who have isolated with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 and relate this to vitamin D status.","The germicidal properties of short wavelength ultraviolet C (UVC) light are well established and used to inactivate many viruses and other microbes. However, much less is known about germicidal effects of terrestrial solar UV light, confined exclusively to wavelengths in the UVA and UVB regions. Here, we have explored the sensitivity of the human coronaviruses HCoV-NL63 and SARS-CoV-2 to solar-simulated full spectrum ultraviolet light (sUV) delivered at environmentally relevant doses. First, HCoV-NL63 coronavirus inactivation by sUV-exposure was confirmed employing (i) viral plaque assays, (ii) RT-qPCR detection of viral genome replication, and (iii) infection-induced stress response gene expression array analysis. Next, a detailed dose-response relationship of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus inactivation by sUV was elucidated, suggesting a half maximal suppression of viral infectivity at low sUV doses. Likewise, extended sUV exposure of SARS-CoV-2 blocked cellular infection as revealed by plaque assay and stress response gene expression array analysis. Moreover, comparative (HCoV-NL63 versus SARS-CoV-2) single gene expression analysis by RT-qPCR confirmed that sUV exposure blocks coronavirus-induced redox, inflammatory, and proteotoxic stress responses. Based on our findings, we estimate that solar ground level full spectrum UV light impairs coronavirus infectivity at environmentally relevant doses. Given the urgency and global scale of the unfolding SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, these prototype data suggest feasibility of solar UV-induced viral inactivation, an observation deserving further molecular exploration in more relevant exposure models.","","Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a metabolic disorder for which the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unclear. This investigation aimed to elucidate essential candidate genes and pathways in T1DM by integrated bioinformatics analysis. In this study, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed using DESeq2 of R package from GSE162689 of the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis, REACTOME pathway enrichment analysis, and construction and analysis of protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, modules, miRNA-hub gene regulatory network and TF-hub gene regulatory network, and validation of hub genes were then performed. A total of 952 DEGs (477 up regulated and 475 down regulated genes) were identified in T1DM. GO and REACTOME enrichment result results showed that DEGs mainly enriched in multicellular organism development, detection of stimulus, diseases of signal transduction by growth factor receptors and second messengers, and olfactory signaling pathway. The top hub genes such as MYC, EGFR, LNX1, YBX1, HSP90AA1, ESR1, FN1, TK1, ANLN and SMAD9 were screened out as the critical genes among the DEGs from the PPI network, modules, miRNA-hub gene regulatory network and TF-hub gene regulatory network. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis and RT-PCR confirmed that these genes were significantly associated with T1DM. In conclusion, the identified DEGs, particularly the hub genes, strengthen the understanding of the advancement and progression of T1DM, and certain genes might be used as candidate target molecules to diagnose, monitor and treat T1DM.","Although glioblastoma is a fatal primary brain cancer with a short median survival of 15 months, a small number of patients survive more than 5 years after diagnosis; they are known as extreme survivors (ES). Due to their rarity, very little is known about what differentiates these outliers from other glioblastoma patients. For the purpose of identifying unknown drivers of extreme survivorship in glioblastoma, we developed the ENDURES consortium (ENvironmental Dynamics Underlying Responsive Extreme Survivors of glioblastoma). This consortium is a multicenter collaborative network of investigators focused on the integration of multiple types of clinical data and the creation of patient-specific models of tumor growth informed by radiographic and histological parameters. Leveraging our combined resources, the goals of the ENDURES consortium are two-fold: (1) to build a curated, searchable, multilayered repository housing clinical and outcome data on a large cohort of ES patients with glioblastoma and (2) to leverage the ENDURES repository for new insights on tumor behavior and novel targets for prolonging survival for all glioblastoma patients. In this article, we review the available literature and discuss what is already known about ES. We then describe the creation of our consortium and some of our preliminary results.","Background Skin cancer incidence has been increasing worldwide, representing a particularly high burden for populations of European ancestry. Outdoor and indoor tanning using ultraviolet radiation (UVR) devices are major risk factors for skin cancer. While tanning behaviours can be modified by targeted interventions to reduce skin cancer rates, there is insufficient evidence on the motivations for tanning preferences and their relationship with pigmentation phenotypes. The present observational and genetically- informed study investigates motives for tanning and the role that pigmentation phenotypes play on outdoor and indoor tanning behaviour in British young adults.","This study focuses on the receptor driven endocytosis typical of viral entry into a cell. A locally increased density of receptors at the time of contact between the cell and the virus is necessary in this case. The virus is considered as a substrate with fixed receptors on its surface, while the receptors of the host cell are free to move over its membrane, allowing a local change in their concentration. In the contact zone the membrane inflects and forms an envelope around the virus. The created vesicle imports its cargo into the cell. The described process is simulated by the diffusion equation accompanied by two boundary conditions. The first boundary condition states that the conservation of binders expressed as the local rate of change of density has to be equal to the negative of the local flux divergence. The second boundary condition represents the energy balance condition with contributions due to the binding of receptors, the free energy of the membrane, its curvature and the kinetic energy due to the motion of the front. The described moving boundary problem in terms of the binder density and the velocity of the adhesion front is well posed and relies on biomechanically motivated assumptions. The problem is numerically solved by using the finite difference method, and the illustrative examples have been chosen to show the influence of the mobility of the receptors and of their initial densities on the velocity of the process.","Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) is a rare disease caused by the obliteration of the pulmonary arterioles, increasing pulmonary vascular resistance and eventually causing right heart failure. Endothelin-1 is a vasoconstrictor peptide whose levels are indicators of disease progression and its pathway is one of the commonest targeted by current treatments.","Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an extremely contagious and cognitive disease that could cause immense hypoxemia. The rise in critically ill patients in epidemic regions has put enormous pressure on hospitals. There is a need to define extreme COVID-19 clinical determinants to optimize clinical diagnosis and the management system is strong. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is linked to a rapidly increasing risk of death rates in population pneumonia. In this research, a network of protein-protein interaction (PPI) was developed using constructed datasets of COVID-19 and COPD genes to define the interrelationship between COVID-19 and COPD, how it affects each other, and the genes that are responsible for the process. The PPI network shows the top 10 common overlapping genes, which include IL10, TLR4, TNF, IL6, CXCL8, IL4, ICAM1, IFNG, TLR2, and IL18. These are the genes that COVID-19 and high-risk COPD patients are known to be expressed. These important genes shared by COVID-19 and COPD are involved in pathways such as malaria, African trypanosomiasis, inflammatory bowel disease, Chagas disease, influenza, and tuberculosis.","Classifying patients into clinically and biologically homogenous subgroups will facilitate the understanding of disease pathophysiology and development of more targeted prevention and intervention strategies. Traditionally, disease subtyping is based on clinical characteristics alone, however disease subtypes identified by such an approach may not conform exactly to the underlying biological mechanisms. Very few studies have integrated genomic profiles (such as those from GWAS) with clinical symptoms for disease subtyping.","Links between solar UV exposure and immunity date back to the ancient Greeks with the development of heliotherapy. Skin contains several UV-sensitive chromophores and exposure to sunlight can produce molecules, such as vitamin D3, that act in an endocrine manner. We investigated whether the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), an environmental sensor and ligand-regulated transcription factor activated by numerous planar compounds of dietary or environmental origin, could be the target of endocrine photoproducts produced by cutaneous UV exposure. 15-to 30-minute exposure of cells to a minimal erythemal dose of UVB irradiation in vitro induced translocation of the AHR to the nucleus, rapidly inducing site-specific DNA binding and target gene regulation. Importantly, ex vivo studies with Ahr wild-type or null fibroblasts showed that serum from mice whose skin was exposed to a 15 min UVB dose, but not control serum, contained agonist activity within 30 min of UV irradiation, inducing AHR-dependent gene expression. Moreover, a 15-min cutaneous UVB exposure induced AHR site-specific DNA binding and target gene regulation in vivo within 3-6 hr post-irradiation in blood and in peripheral tissues, including intestine. These results show that cutaneous exposure of mice to a single minimal erythemic dose of UVB induces rapid AHR signaling in multiple peripheral organs, providing compelling evidence that moderate sun exposure can exert endocrine control of immunity through the AHR.","1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1, 25 (OH)2 D3) and mechanical stimuli in physiological environment play an important role in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis. The effects of 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 alone and mechanical stimuli alone on osteoblasts have been widely investigated. This study reports the collective influences of 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and flow shear stress (FSS) on biological functions of osteoblasts. 1, 25 (OH)2 D3 were constructed in various kinds of concentration (0, 1, 10, 100 nmmol/L), while physiological fluid shear stress (12 dynes/cm2) were produced by using a parallel-plate fluid flow system. 1, 25 (OH)2 D3 affects the responses of ROBs to FSS, including the inhibition of NO releases and cell proliferation as well as the promotion of PGE2 releases and cell differentiation. These findings provide a possible mechanism by which 1, 25(OH)2 D3 influences osteoblasts responses to FSS and may provide guidance for the selection of 1, 25(OH)2 D3 concentration and mechanical loading in order to in vitro produce functional bone tissues.","With the evolution of multicellularity, communication among cells in different organs/tissues became pivotal to life. Molecular basis of such communication has long been studied, but genome-wide screens for biomolecules/genes mediating tissue-tissue signaling are lacking. To systematically identify inter-tissue mediators, we present a novel computational approach MultiCens (Multilayer/Multi-tissue network Centrality measures). Unlike single-layer network methods, MultiCens can distinguish within- vs. across-layer connectivity to quantify the \u201cinfluence\u201d of any gene in a tissue on a query set of genes of interest in another tissue. MultiCens enjoys theoretical guarantees on convergence and decomposability, and excels on synthetic benchmarks. On human multi-tissue datasets, MultiCens predicts known and novel genes linked to hormones. MultiCens further reveals shifts in gene network architecture among four brain regions in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. MultiCens-prioritized hypotheses from these two diverse applications, and potential future ones like \u201cMulti-tissue-expanded Gene Ontology\u201d analysis, can enable whole-body yet molecular-level investigations in humans.","The E3 ligase FBW7 targets drivers of cell cycle progression such as c-MYC for proteasomal degradation. It is frequently mutated in cancer, and is a tumor suppressor. Extensive epidemiological data links vitamin D deficiency to increased incidence of several cancers, although the underlying cancer-preventive mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we show that hormonal 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D) rapidly stimulates the interaction of the VDR with FBW7, and that of FBW7 with c-MYC. In contrast, it blocks the association of FBW7 with c-MYC antagonist MXD1. 1,25D also enhances the association of FBW7, proteasome subunits, and ubiquitin with DNA-bound c-MYC, consistent with induced degradation of c-MYC on DNA. In addition to c-MYC, 1,25D accelerates the turnover of other FBW7 target proteins. Intriguingly, FBW7 is essential for optimal VDR gene expression. It is also recruited to VDR targets genes, and its depletion attenuates 1,25D-stimulated VDR DNA binding, transactivation, and cell cycle arrest. Thus, the VDR and FBW7 are mutual cofactors, which provides a molecular basis for the cancer-preventive actions of vitamin D through accelerated turnover of FBW7 target proteins.","Background Vitamin D modulates the inflammatory and immune response to tuberculosis (TB) and also mediates the induction of the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin. Deficiency of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene may increase the risk of TB disease and decrease culture conversion rates in drug susceptible TB. Whether these VDR SNPs are found in African populations or impact multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB treatment has not been established. We aimed to determine if SNPs in the VDR gene were associated with sputum culture conversion among a cohort of MDR TB patients in South Africa.","Background We examined whether the greater severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) amongst men and non-White ethnicities is explained by cardiometabolic, socio-economic, or behavioural factors.","Genetic association studies are frequently used to study the genetic basis of numerous human phenotypes. However, the rapid interrogation of how well a certain genomic region associates across traits as well as the interpretation of genetic associations is often complex and requires the integration of multiple sources of annotation, which involves advanced bioinformatic skills. We developed snpXplorer, an easy-to-use web-server application for exploring Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) association statistics and to functionally annotate sets of SNPs. snpXplorer can superimpose association statistics from multiple studies, and displays regional information including SNP associations, structural variations, recombination rates, eQTL, linkage disequilibrium patterns, genes and gene-expressions per tissue. By overlaying multiple GWAS studies, snpXplorer can be used to compare levels of association across different traits, which may help the interpretation of variant consequences. Given a list of SNPs, snpXplorer can also be used to perform variant-to-gene mapping and gene-set enrichment analysis to identify molecular pathways that are overrepresented in the list of input SNPs. snpXplorer is freely available at https://snpxplorer.net. Source code, documentation, example files and tutorial videos are available within the Help section of snpXplorer and at https://github.com/TesiNicco/snpXplorer.","Gaining insight into the downstream consequences of non-coding variants is an essential step towards the identification of therapeutic targets from genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings. Here we have harmonized and integrated 8,727 RNA-seq samples with accompanying genotype data from multiple brain-regions from 14 datasets. This sample size enabled us to perform both cis- and trans-expression quantitative locus (eQTL) mapping. Upon comparing the brain cortex cis-eQTLs (for 12,307 unique genes at FDR&lt;0.05) with a large blood cis-eQTL analysis (n=31,684 samples), we observed that brain eQTLs are more tissue specific than previously assumed.","Despite reducing the prevalent foodborne pathogen Campylobacter jejuni in chickens decreases campylobacteriosis, few effective approaches are available. The aim of this study was to use microbial metabolic product bile acids to reduce C. jejuni chicken colonization. Broiler chicks were fed with deoxycholic acid (DCA), lithocholic acid (LCA), or ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). The birds were also transplanted with DCA modulated anaerobes (DCA-Anaero) or aerobes (DCA-Aero). The birds were infected with human clinical isolate C. jejuni 81-176 or chicken isolate C. jejuni AR101. Notably, C. jejuni 81-176 was readily colonized intestinal tract at d16 and reached an almost plateau at d21. Remarkably, DCA excluded C. jejuni cecal colonization at 100, 99.997, and 100% at 16, 21, and 28 days of age. Neither chicken ages of infection nor LCA or UDCA altered C. jejuni AR101 chicken colonization level, while DCA reduced 91% of the bacterium in chickens at d28. Notably, DCA diet reduced phylum Firmicutes but increased Bacteroidetes compared to infected control birds. Importantly, DCA-Anaero attenuated 93% of C. jejuni colonization at d28 compared to control infected birds. In conclusion, DCA shapes microbiota composition against C. jejuni colonization in chickens, suggesting a bidirectional interaction between microbiota and microbial metabolites.","Objective A systematic review with meta-analysis was performed to assess a possible association between plasma vitamin D levels and mortality in patients with COVID \u2013 19.","Evidence is growing for a role of vitamin D in regulating skeletal muscle mass, strength and functional capacity. Given the role the kidneys play in activating total vitamin D, and the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), it is possible that deficiency contributes to the low levels of physical function and muscle mass in these patients. This is a secondary cross-sectional analysis of previously published interventional study, with ex vivo follow up work. 34 CKD patients at stages G3b-5 (eGFR 25.5 \u00b1 8.3ml/min/1.73m2; age 61 \u00b1 12 years) were recruited, with a sub-group (n=20) also donating a muscle biopsy. Vitamin D and associated metabolites were analysed in plasma by liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectroscopy and correlated to a range of physiological tests of muscle size, function, exercise capacity and body composition. The effects of 1\u03b1,25(OH)2D3 supplementation on myogenesis and myotube size was investigated in primary skeletal muscle cells from vitamin D deficient donors. In vivo, there was no association between total or active vitamin D and muscle size or strength, but a significant correlation with  was seen with the total form. Ex vivo, 1\u03b1,25(OH)2D3 supplementation reduced IL-6 mRNA expression, but had no effect upon proliferation, differentiation or myotube diameter. This early preliminary work suggests that vitamin D deficiency is not a prominent factor driving the loss of muscle mass in CKD, but may play a role in reduced exercise capacity.","Background Hypothesis-free Mendelian randomization studies provide a way to assess the causal relevance of a trait across the human phenome but can be limited by statistical power or complicated by horizontal pleiotropy. The recently described latent causal variable (LCV) approach provides an alternative method for causal inference which might be useful in hypothesis-free experiments.","Hematological measures are important intermediate clinical phenotypes for many acute and chronic diseases. Hematological measures are highly heritable, and although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of loci containing trait-associated variants, the causal genes underlying these associations are often uncertain. To better understand the underlying genetic regulatory mechanisms, we performed a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) using PrediXcan to systematically investigate the association between genetically-predicted gene expression and hematological measures in 54,542 individuals of European ancestry from the Genetic Epidemiology Research on Adult Health and Aging (GERA) cohort. We found 239 significant gene-trait associations with hematological measures. Among this set of 239 associations, we replicated 71 at p &lt; 0.05 with same direction of effect for the blood cell trait in a meta-analysis of TWAS results consisting of up to 35,900 European ancestry individuals from the Women\u2019s Health Initiative (WHI), the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC), and BioMe Biobank. We further attempted to refine this list of candidate genes by performing conditional analyses, adjusting for individual variants previously associated with these hematological measures, and performed further fine-mapping of TWAS loci. To assist with the interpretation of TWAS findings, we designed an R Shiny application to interactively visualize TWAS results, one genomic locus at a time, by integrating our TWAS results with additional genetic data sources (GWAS, TWAS from other gene expression reference panels, conditional analyses, known GWAS variants, etc.). Our results and R Shiny application highlight frequently overlooked challenges with TWAS and illustrate the complexity of TWAS fine-mapping efforts.","Adverse effects of low vitamin D level on mortality and morbidity are controversially discussed. Especially older people are at risk for vitamin D deficiency and therefore exposed to its potentially harmful influence on the aging process. A way of measuring differences in the biological age is through DNA methylation age (DNAm age) and its deviation from chronological age, DNAm age acceleration (DNAmAA). We previously reported on an association between vitamin D deficiency and higher 7-CpG DNAmAA in participants of the Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II).","Behavioral genetics and cultural evolution have both revolutionized our understanding of human behavior, but largely independently of each other. Here we reconcile these two fields using a dual inheritance approach, which offers a more nuanced understanding of the interaction between genes and culture, and a resolution to several long-standing puzzles. For example, by neglecting how human environments are extensively shaped by cultural dynamics, behavioral genetic approaches systematically inflate heritability estimates and thereby overestimate the genetic basis of human behavior. A WEIRD (Western, educated, industrialized, rich, democratic) gene problem obscures this inflation. Considering both genetic and cultural evolutionary forces, heritability scores become less a property of a trait and more a moving target that responds to cultural and social changes. Ignoring cultural evolutionary forces leads to an over-simplified model of gene-to-phenotype causality. When cumulative culture functionally overlaps with genes, genetic effects become masked, or even reversed, and the causal effect of an identified gene is confounded with features of the cultural environment, specific to a particular society at a particular time. This framework helps explain why it is easier to discover genes for deficiencies than genes for abilities. With this framework, we predict the ways in which heritability should differ between societies, between socioeconomic levels within some societies but not others, and over the life course. An integrated cultural evolutionary behavioral genetics cuts through the nature\u2013nurture debate and elucidates controversial topics such as general intelligence.","How obesity affects immune function is not well understood. Clinically, obesity is strongly associated with severe TH2 immunopathology1-3, though the physiological, cellular, and molecular underpinnings of this association remain obscure. Here, we demonstrate that obese mice are susceptible to severe atopic dermatitis (AD), a major manifestation of TH2 immunopathology and disease burden in humans4,5. Mechanistically, we show that dysregulation of the nuclear hormone receptor (NHR) PPAR\u03b3 (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) in T cells is a causal link between obesity and the increased TH2 immunopathology. We find that PPAR\u03b3 oversees a cellular metabolic transcriptional program that restrains nuclear gene expression of the chief TH2 priming and effector cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4). Accordingly, thiazolidinediones (TZDs), potent PPAR\u03b3 agonists, robustly protect obese mice from TH2 immunopathology. Collectively, these findings establish PPAR\u03b3 as a molecular link between obesity and TH2 immune homeostasis and identify TZDs as novel therapeutic candidates for TH2 immunopathology. Fundamentally, these findings demonstrate that shifting physiologic metabolic states can shape the tone of adaptive immune responses to modulate differential disease susceptibility.","Background Sleep apnoea is a disorder characterised by periods of halted breathing during sleep. Despite its association with severe health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, liver problems and metabolic syndrome, the aetiology of sleep apnoea remain understudied, and previous genetic analyses have not identified many robustly associated genetic risk variants.","BACKGROUND The aim of this study is to identify seasonal changes in total 25(OH) vitamin D (VD) concentrations and determine its influence on acute upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) morbidity among elite athletes engaged in water sports.","Nephrolithiasis is a common urological trait disorder with acute pain. Although previous studies have identified various genetic variations associated with nephrolithiasis, the host genetic factors remain largely unidentified. To identify novel nephrolithiasis loci in the Japanese population, we performed large-scale GWAS (Genome wide association study) using 11,130 cases and 187,639 controls, followed by a replication analysis using 2,289 cases and 3,817 controls. The analysis identified 14 significant loci, including 9 novel loci on 2p23.2-3, 6p21.2, 6p12.3, 6q23.2, 16p12.3, 16q12.2, 17q23.2, 19p13.12, and 20q13.2. Interestingly, 10 of the 14 regions showed a significant association with any of 16 quantitative traits, including metabolic, kidney-related, and electrolyte traits, suggesting a common genetic background among nephrolithiasis patients and these quantitative traits. Four novel loci are related to the metabolic pathway, while the remaining 10 loci are associated with the crystallization pathway. Our findings demonstrate the crucial roles of genetic variations in the development of nephrolithiasis.","Drug combination therapy is a well-established concept in the treatment of complex diseases due to its fewer side effects, lower toxicity, and better efficacy. However, it is challenging to identify efficacious drug combinations from many drug candidates. Computational models could greatly reduce the cost, but most models did not use data for more than two-drug combinations and could not predict three-drug therapy. However, three-drug combinations account for about 21% of the known combinations, which is a very important type of treatment. Here, we utilized higher-order information and developed an improved hypergraph random walk model (IHRW) for three-drug therapy prediction. This is the first method to explore the combination of three drugs.","Cranial sutures are growth and stress diffusion sites that connect the bones protecting the brain. The closure of cranial suture is a key feature of mammalian late development and evolution, which can also lead to head malformations when it occurs prematurely (craniosynostosis). To unveil the phenotypic and genetic causes of suture closure in evolution, we examined 48 mammalian species searching for (i) causal links between suture patency, brain size, and diet using phylogenetic path analysis; and (ii) instances of genome-phenome convergence amino acid substitutions. Here we show that brain size and the anteroposterior order of ossification of the skull are the two main causes of sutures patency in evolution. We also identified three novel candidate genes for suture closure in evolution (HRNR, KIAA1549, and TTN), which have never been reported in clinical studies of craniosynostosis. Our results suggest that different genetic pathways underlie cranial suture closure in evolution and disease.","Background Particulate matter (PM) pollutant exposure, which induces oxidative stress and inflammation, and vitamin D insufficiency, which compromises immune regulation, are detrimental in asthma.","Despite advances in cancer treatments, early detection of cancer is still the most promising way to improve outcomes. Without homeostatic control, urine reflects early changes in the body and can potentially be used for early cancer diagnosis. In this study, a Walker 256 tumor rat model was established by subcutaneous injection of Walker 256 tumor cells. To identify urinary proteome changes during cancer development, urine samples from Walker 256 tumor-bearing rats were collected at five time points corresponding to before cancer cell implantation, before tumor mass palpability, at tumor mass appearance, during rapid tumor growth, and at cachexia. The urinary protein patterns changed significantly as the tumors progressed, as measured using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The urinary proteome of tumor-bearing rats was identified using Fusion Lumos mass spectrometry with label-free quantification. Then, 30 dynamically changed urinary proteins during cancer progression were selected as more reliable cancer biomarkers, and they were validated by targeted proteomics. Combined with the results of label-free and targeted proteome quantification, a total of 10 urinary proteins (HPT, APOA4, CO4, B2MG, A1AG, CATC, VCAM1, CALB1, CSPG4, and VTDB) changed significantly even before a tumor mass was palpable, and these early changes in urine could also be identified with differential abundance at late stages of cancer. Our study indicated that urine is a sensitive biomarker source for early detection of cancer.","BACKGROUND Vitamin D metabolites support innate immune responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and other respiratory pathogens. Randomized controlled trials of vitamin D to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) have not yet reported.","Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder and accumulating evidence has suggested that dysbiosis of the gut microbiome plays an essential role. However, a body of research has investigated the ASD gut microbiome without consensus as to whether or how the ASD microbiome differs from neurotypical children. Here, we evaluate the underlying factors leading to study discrepancies by performing a meta-analysis on reprocessed 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon (16S) sequencing data. We compile a total of 1,740 samples across 13 carefully selected published studies together with samples from the American Gut Project, and analyze the data in aggregate and from a per-study perspective. We observed increased Bifidobacterium, Actinobacteria, and Prevotella among ASD individuals across cohorts. We further identified associations to Desulfovibrionales, Deltaproteobacteria and Prevotella that were dependent upon which 16S variable regions were sequenced. Utilizing machine learning (ML), we obtained increased accuracy in ASD classification using data collected from certain territories, on younger subjects, on unrelated age-matched rather than related controls, on samples with increased sequencing depth and when accounting for sex differences. Our work provides compelling evidence that the gut microbiome is altered in ASD patients, and highlights novel factors that are important considerations for future studies.","A highly aggressive subset of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas undergo trans-differentiation into the squamous lineage during disease progression. While the tumorigenic consequences of this aberrant cell fate transition are poorly understood, recent studies have identified a role for the master regulator TP63 in this process. Here, we investigated whether squamous trans-differentiation of pancreatic cancer cells can influence the phenotype of non-neoplastic cells in the tumor microenvironment. Conditioned media experiments revealed that squamous-subtype pancreatic cancer cells secrete factors that convert quiescent pancreatic stellate cells into a specialized subtype of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) that express inflammatory genes at high levels. We use gain- and loss-of-function approaches in vivo to show that squamous-subtype pancreatic tumor models become enriched with inflammatory CAFs and neutrophils in a TP63-dependent manner. These non cell-autonomous effects occur, at least in part, through TP63-mediated activation of enhancers at pro-inflammatory cytokine loci, which includes IL1A as a key target. Taken together, our findings reveal enhanced tissue inflammation as a consequence of squamous trans-differentiation in pancreatic cancer, thus highlighting an instructive role of tumor cell lineage in reprogramming the stromal microenvironment.","Adolescence is an important period when people need adequate nutrition for healthy growth and development, whether from food or water. Tap water, bottled water (bottled purified water, and bottled natural water) are now the three most popular drinking waters consumed by adolescents in China. However, the constituents of them differ, which may cause different long-term health effects. In order to determine which type of water is the most beneficial regarding developmental behaviors, lipid metabolism and antioxidant capacity of juvenile zebrafish, 21 dpf (days post-fertilization) zebrafish were given these three waters separately with the same feed until 90 dpf. Results showed that zebrafish in purified water had the lowest survival rate, body weight and body length, while zebrafish in natural water and tap water had similar developmental behaviors; the highest HDL-C level and the lowest TG level were found in natural water, tap water second; and zebrafish in natural water showed the best antioxidant capacity. Thus, the best outcomes were found in natural water, which had suitable pH and proper amount of minerals, tap water also showed good performance, while purified water seemed not suitable for juvenile zebrafish.","Context Vaccination against Sars-Cov-2 is in full swing during COVID-19 pandemic. One of the efficient methods to evaluate response to vaccination is the assessment of humoral immunity by measuring Sars-Cov-2 antibody titer. Identification of factors that affect the humoral response is important so as to ameliorate the responses to vaccination or identify vulnerable groups that may need vaccination boosters.","The repeated evolution of novel life histories correlating with ecological variables offer opportunities to test scenarios of convergence and determinism in genetic, developmental, and metabolic features. Here we leverage the diversity of aplocheiloid killifishes, a clade of teleost fishes that contains over 750 species on three continents. Nearly half of these are \u201cannual\u201d or seasonal species that inhabit bodies of water that desiccate and are unfeasible for growth, reproduction, or survival for weeks to months at a time. We present a large-scale phylogenomic reconstruction of aplocheiloid killifish evolution using newly sequenced transcriptomes from all major clades. We show that developmental dormancy (diapause) and annualism have up to seven independent origins in Africa and America. We then measure evolutionary rates of orthologous genes and show that annual life history is correlated with higher dN/dS ratios. Many of these fast-evolving genes in annual species constitute key developmental genes and nuclear-encoded metabolic genes that control oxidative phosphorylation. Lastly, we compare these fast-evolving genes to genes associated with developmental dormancy and metabolic shifts in killifishes and other vertebrates and thereby identify molecular evolutionary signatures of repeated evolutionary transitions to extreme environments.","Background Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) is the most common pregnancy complication to occur worldwide, however prevalence varies substantially between ethnicities with South Asians experiencing up to 3-times the risk of the disease compared to white Europeans (WEs). Factors driving this discrepancy in prevalence and the pathogenesis of GDM are unclear, although the metabolome is of great importance due to the metabolic dysregulation characterised GDM.","Background Many nutrients have powerful immunomodulatory actions with the potential to alter susceptibility to COVID-19 infection, progression to symptoms, likelihood of severe disease and survival. The pandemic has fostered many nutrition-related theories, sometimes backed by a biased interpretation of evidence.","Background Critical care and sepsis remain high priority concerns in children. Observational studies report high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and present mixed results regarding the correlation between vitamin D status and adverse outcomes. Associations between deficiency and mortality, particularly in children with sepsis, remain unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to address this uncertainty.","There is increasing interest about the interplay between host genetics and gut microbiome on human complex diseases, with prior evidence mainly derived from animal models. In addition, the shared and distinct microbiome features among human complex diseases remain largely unclear. We performed a microbiome genome-wide association study to identify host genetic variants associated with gut microbiome in a Chinese population with 1475 participants. We then conducted bi-directional Mendelian randomization analyses to examine the potential causal associations between gut microbiome and human complex diseases. We found that Saccharibacteria (also known as TM7 phylum) could potentially improve renal function by affecting renal function biomarkers (i.e., creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate). In contrast, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease and prostate cancer, as predicted by the host genetics, had potential causal effect on gut microbiome. Further disease-microbiome feature analysis suggested that gut microbiome features revealed novel relationship among human complex diseases. These results suggest that different human complex diseases share common and distinct gut microbiome features, which may help re-shape our understanding about the disease etiology in humans.","Mendelian Randomization (MR) uses genetic instrumental variables to make causal inferences. Whilst sometimes referred to as \u201cnature\u2019s randomized trial\u201d, it has distinct assumptions that make comparisons between the results of MR studies with those of actual randomized controlled trials (RCTs) invaluable. To scope the potential for (semi-)-automated triangulation of MR and RCT evidence, we mined ClinicalTrials.Gov, PubMed and EpigraphDB databases and carried out a series of 26 manual literature comparisons among 54 MR and 77 RCT publications. We found that only 11% of completed RCTs identified in ClinicalTrials.Gov submitted their results to the database. Similarly low coverage was revealed for Semantic Medline (SemMedDB) semantic triples derived from MR and RCT publications \u201325% and 12%, respectively. Among intervention types that can be mimicked by MR, only trials of pharmaceutical interventions could be automatically matched to MR results due to insufficient annotation with MeSH ontology. A manual survey of the literature highlighted the potential for triangulation across a number of exposure/outcome pairs if these challenges can be addressed. We conclude that careful triangulation of MR with RCT evidence should involve consideration of similarity of phenotypes across study designs, intervention intensity and duration, study population demography and health status, comparator group, intervention goal and quality of evidence.","Background and Aim Vitamin D3 (i.e. cholecalciferol) produces an active metabolite 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (i.e. 25(OH)D3) to promote intestinal calcium absorption. Given high population heterogeneity in 25(OH)D3 plasma concentration profiles, vitamin D3 dose regimen needs to be personalised. The objective of this study is to establish a model that accurately predicts 25(OH)D3 pharmacokinetics (PK) on an individual level to enable selection of an appropriate dose regimen for anyone.","The superior ability of norursodeoxycholic acid (norUDCA) to induce a bicarbonate-rich hypercholeresis has been attributed to its ability to undergo cholehepatic shunting and norUDCA is currently being evaluated as a therapeutic for forms of liver disease. The goal of this study was to use mouse models to investigate contributions of bile acid transporters to the choleretic actions of norUDCA. Here, we show that the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT) and Organic solute transporter-alpha (OST\u03b1) are dispensable for norUDCA-stimulation of bile flow and biliary bicarbonate secretion in mice. Analysis of the liver transcriptome revealed that norUDCA induced hepatic expression of a limited number of transporter genes, particularly organic anion transporting polypeptide 1a4 (Oatp1a4). However, norUDCA potently stimulated a bicarbonate-rich hypercholeresis in Oatp1a/1b-deficient mice. Blocking intestinal bile acid reabsorption by co-administration of an ASBT inhibitor or bile acid sequestrant did not impact the ability of norUDCA to induce bile flow in wildtype mice. The results support the concept that these major bile acid transporters are not directly involved in the absorption, cholehepatic shunting, or choleretic actions of norUDCA. Additionally, the findings support further investigation of the therapeutic synergy between norUDCA and ASBT inhibitors or bile acid sequestrants for cholestatic liver disease.","Modern population-scale biobanks contain simultaneous measurements of many phenotypes, providing unprecedented opportunity to study the relationship between biomarkers and disease. However, inferring causal effects from observational data is notoriously challenging. Mendelian randomization (MR) has recently received increased attention as a class of methods for estimating causal effects using genetic associations. However, standard methods result in pervasive false positives when two traits share a heritable, unobserved common cause. This is the problem of correlated pleiotropy. Here, we introduce a flexible framework for simulating traits with a common genetic confounder that generalizes recently proposed models, as well as simple approach we call Welch-weighted Egger regression (WWER) for estimating causal effects. We show in comprehensive simulations that our method substantially reduces false positives due to correlated pleiotropy while being fast enough to apply to hundreds of phenotypes. We first apply our method to a subset of the UK Biobank consisting of blood traits and inflammatory disease, and then a broader set of 411 heritable phenotypes. We detect many effects with strong literature support, as well as numerous behavioral effects that appear to stem from physician advice given to people at high risk for disease. We conclude that WWER is a powerful tool for exploratory data analysis in ever-growing databases of genotypes and phenotypes.","Background Vitamin D status may be associated with depression, but there have been inconsistencies in the reported estimates. This study aimed to examine the association of vitamin D status with depression in a large general population sample.","Objective To compare and rank different exercise interventions on bone mineral density (BMD) in postmenopausal women.","Importance Vitamin D treatment has been found to decrease incidence of viral respiratory tract infection, especially in vitamin D deficiency. It is unknown whether COVID-19 incidence is associated with vitamin D deficiency and treatment.","Although recent studies have revealed the association between the gut microbiota and obesity, the causality remains elusive. We performed a Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis to determine whether there is a causal relationship between gut microbiota and abdominal obesity. We used a two-sample MR approach to assess the causal effect from gut microbiota to obesity based on genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics. The GWAS summary statistics of gut microbiota obtained from UK-twins cohort (N=1,126) were used as discovery sample exposure, and the GWAS summary statistics from the Genetic Environmental Microbial (GEM) project (N=1,098) were used as replication sample exposure. Trunk fat mass (TFM) summary statistics from the UK Biobank (UKB) cohort (N=330,762) were used as outcome. Bacteria were grouped into taxa features at family level. A total of 16 families were analyzed in the discovery sample. Family Barnesiellaceae was associated with TFM at the nominal significance level (b=-3.81\u00d710\u22124, P=1.96\u00d710\u22123). The causal association was successfully replicated in the replication sample (b=-7.34\u00d710\u22123, P =2.77\u00d710\u22122). Our findings provided evidence of causal relationship from microbiota to fat development, and may be helpful in selecting potential causal bacteria for manipulating candidate gut microbiota to therapy obesity.","Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone produced in gut L-cells, which regulates postprandial glucose-dependent insulin secretion, also known as the incretin effect. GLP-1 secretion may be reduced in type 2 diabetes mellitus, impacting on glycaemic regulation. Thus, methods to enhance endogenous GLP-1 secretion by use of natural GLP-1 secretagogues may improve glucose control in diabetes. Gypenosides (GYP) extracted from the plant Gynostemma Pentaphyllum (Jiaogulan) are known for their glucose-lowering effects both in vitro and in vivo, although their effect on GLP-1 secretion is unknown. Our results showed that GYP enhanced cell viability and significantly upregulated antioxidant gene Nrf2, Cat and Ho-1 expression. GYP did not affect glucokinase expression but downregulated proglucagon gene expression over 24h, although, cellular GLP-1 content was unchanged. Prohormone convertase 1 (Pcsk1) gene expression was unchanged by GYP over 24h, although protein levels were significantly downregulated, while prohormone convertase 2 (Pcsk2) mRNA and protein levels were significantly upregulated. Acute exposure to gypenosides enhanced calcium uptake and GLP-1 release from GLUTag cells both at low and high glucose concentrations. These results suggest that anti-diabetic properties of gypenosides are partly linked to their ability to stimulate GLP-1 secretion. Gypenosides enhance antioxidant gene expression and may protect L-cells from excess oxidative stress.","Epidemiologic evidence relating to the causation of Multiple Sclerosis, based upon twin concordance studies, implicates both genetic and environmental contributions. The HLA-DRB1/ HLA-A haplotype confers a 23 fold increase in MS prevalence above its baseline of 1 per 1,000 persons. Epigenetic factors, such as an aberrant response to Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) and Vitamin D deficiency can increase that risk 36 and 2 fold respectively. Evidence of an association between elevated MAP antibodies and Multiple Sclerosis has been reported.","Seasonal variation in environmental meteorological conditions affect the incidence of infectious diseases. Ultraviolet A (UVA) radiation induces release of cutaneous photolabile nitric oxide (NO) impacting the cardiovascular system and metabolic syndrome, COVID-19 risk factors. NO also inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV. We therefore model the relationship between UVA radiation, derived from remote sensed data, and COVID-19 deaths for counties across the USA during their \u2018UV vitamin D winter\u2019 (Jan-April) adjusting for confounding including by temperature and humidity. The Mortality Risk Ratio (MRR) falls by 29% (40% -15% (95% CI)) per 100 (KJ/m2) increase in mean daily UVA. We replicate this in independent studies in Italy and England and estimate a pooled decline in MRR of 32% (48%-12%) per 100 KJ/m2 across the three studies.","Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked neurological disorder caused by mutations in the transcriptional regulator MECP2. Mecp2 loss-of-function leads to the disruption of many cellular pathways, including aberrant activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway. Genetically attenuating the NF-\u03baB pathway in Mecp2-null mice ameliorates hallmark phenotypes of RTT, including reduced dendritic complexity, raising the question of whether NF-\u03baB pathway inhibitors could provide a therapeutic avenue for RTT. Vitamin D is a known inhibitor of NF-\u03baB signaling; further, vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in RTT patients and male Mecp2-null mice. We previously demonstrated that vitamin D rescues the aberrant NF-\u03baB activity and reduced neurite outgrowth of Mecp2-knockdown cortical neurons in vitro, and that dietary vitamin D supplementation rescues decreased dendritic complexity and soma size of neocortical projection neurons in both male hemizygous Mecp2-null and female heterozygous mice in vivo. Here, we have identified over 200 genes whose dysregulated expression in the Mecp2+/- cortex is modulated by dietary vitamin D. Genes normalized with vitamin D supplementation are involved in dendritic complexity, synapses, and neuronal projections, suggesting that the rescue of their expression could underpin the rescue of neuronal morphology. Further, motor and anxiety-like behavioral phenotypes in Mecp2+/- mice correlate with circulating vitamin D levels, and there is a disruption in the homeostasis of the vitamin D synthesis pathway in Mecp2+/- mice. Thus, our data indicate that vitamin D modulates RTT pathology and its supplementation could provide a simple and cost-effective partial therapeutic for RTT.","Background The D-Health Trial aims to determine whether monthly high-dose vitamin D supplementation can reduce the mortality rate and prevent cancer. We did not have adequate statistical power for subgroup analyses, so could not justify the high cost of collecting blood samples at baseline. To enable future exploratory analyses stratified by baseline vitamin D status, we developed a model to predict baseline serum 25 hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration.","Background Although depression is recognized as the leading cause of disability worldwide, decades of research have identified few actionable preventive factors. Using phenotypic and genomic data from the UK Biobank, we took advantage of a unique opportunity to screen a wide range of potentially modifiable factors that could offset known risk factors for depression.","In this study, we describe the changes associated with three months of intermittent fasting and probiotic yogurt consumption in a 72-year-old marathon runner with chronic lymphocytic leukemia for a number of years. Serum alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (nagalase), a marker of inflammation and cancer cell proliferation, was significantly decreased at the end of a three-month observation. These results are consistent with immune modulating properties of certain probiotics based on the fermentation of milk and colostrum. Urinary excretion of non-metal toxicants that accumulate in adipose tissue such as Perchlorate, N-acetyl(2-hydroxypropyl)cysteine (NAHP), 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, 3-Phenoxybenzoic acid (3PBA), N-acetyl phenyl cysteine (NAP), Phenylglycoxylic acid (PGO), Monoethylphthalate (MEP) and 2-Hydroxyisobutyric Acid (2HIB) was significantly increased. These results are consistent with the weight loss (5 Kg) associated with intermittent fasting and with the known features of probiotics as detoxification tools. Consistent with certain toxicants acting as endocrine disruptors, we observed an increased elimination of toxicants and a 33% decrease of serum Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), suggesting a trend toward normalization of thyroid function. These results support the hypothesis that a combination of intermittent fasting with the consumption of specific probiotic yogurts may lead to immune modulation, detoxification and other improvements.","To investigate the relationship between BCG vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 by bioinformatic approach. Two datasets for Sars-CoV-2 infection group and BCG-vaccinated group were downloaded. Differentially Expressed Genes were identified. Gene ontology and pathways were functionally enriched, and networking was constructed in NetworkAnalyst. Lastly, correlation between post-BCG vaccination and COVID-19 transcriptome signatures were established. A total of 161 DEGs (113 upregulated DEGs and 48 downregulated genes) were identified in the Sars-CoV-2 group. In the pathway enrichment analysis, cross-reference of upregulated KEGG pathways in Sars-CoV-2 with downregulated counterparts in the BCG-vaccinated group, resulted in the intersection of 45 common pathways, accounting for 86.5% of SARS-CoV-2 upregulated pathways. Of these intersecting pathways, a vast majority were immune and inflammatory pathways with top significance in IL-17, TNF, NOD-like receptors, and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways. Our data suggests BCG-vaccination may incur a protective role in COVID-19 patients until a targeted vaccine is developed.","Infection biology and pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), are incompletely understood. Here, we assessed the impact of airway epithelial cellular composition on infection in air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures of differentiated primary human tracheal (PTEC) and bronchial epithelial cells (PBEC). We first compared SARS-CoV-2 infection kinetics, related antiviral and inflammatory responses, and viral entry factors in PTEC and PBEC. Next, the contribution of differentiation time was investigated by differentiating ALI-PTEC/PBEC for 3-5 weeks and comparing dynamics of viral replication/spread, cellular composition and epithelial responses. We observed a gradual increase in viral load with prolonged culture duration. Ciliated and goblet cells were predominantly infected in both PTEC and PBEC. Immunofluorescence analysis and RT-qPCR showed that compared to other cell types mainly ciliated and goblet cell numbers were affected by increased culture duration. An increased proportion of these two target cell types was associated with increased viral load. Furthermore, modulation of cellular composition using IL-13 and the Notch signaling inhibitor DAPT, underlined the importance of both ciliated and goblet cells for infection. DAPT treatment resulted in a lower viral load and a relative increase in ciliated cells at the expense of goblet cells, compared to IL-13 treated cultures in which both cell types were present and viral load was higher.","A total of 6,628 PUBMED-registered publications on the relationships between the effects of vaccination and the provision of micronutrients have been studied by methods of topological analysis of text data. In case of insufficient intake of certain micronutrients, the functioning of the acquired immunity is disrupted resulting in an imbalance of populations of T-cells CD4+/CD8+ and of B-lymphocytes. Nutritional supplements of folate, vitamins A, D and B12, which are recognized regulators of cell division, support a wide range of lymphocyte populations. Trace elements zinc, iron, selenium, manganese and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are also important for supporting the mechanisms of acquired immunity. The data presented show that a course intake of these micronutrients by patients planning vaccination can significantly improve its effectiveness. In particular, these micronutrients can increase the titers of antibodies to pathogens, and to reduce the percentage of patients who still contract infection after vaccination. Supplements of these micronutrients can also contribute to the safety of vaccination: to prevent malaise and, in the unfortunate case of contracting infection despite the vaccine, to reduce the severity of the course and the mortality from the corresponding infection.","The role of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure in the pathology of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) has been debated for decades with epidemiological evidence failing to find a clear consensus for or against it playing a role. A key reason for this is a lack of foundational research into the response of living retinal tissue to UVR in regard to AMD-specific parameters of tissue function. We therefore explored the response of cultured retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE), the loss of which heralds advanced AMD, to specific wavelengths of UVR across the UV-B and UV-A bands found in natural sunlight.","Background Increased vitamin D levels, as reflected by 25OHD measurements, have been proposed to protect against COVID-19 disease based on in-vitro, observational, and ecological studies. However, vitamin D levels are associated with many confounding variables and thus associations described to date may not be causal. Vitamin D Mendelian randomization (MR) studies have provided results that are concordant with large-scale vitamin D randomized trials. Here, we used two-sample MR to assess evidence supporting a causal effect of circulating 25OHD levels on COVID-19 susceptibility and severity.","To investigate the origins and stages of vertebrate adaptive radiation, we reconstructed the spatial and temporal histories of genetic variants underlying major phenotypic axes of diversification from the genomes of 202 Caribbean pupfishes. Ancient standing variation from disparate spatial sources was reassembled into new combinations which are under strong selection for adaptation to novel trophic niches on only a single island throughout the Caribbean. This occurred in three stages: first, standing variation associated with feeding behavior swept, then standing variation regulating craniofacial development and pigmentation, and finally de novo variation for craniofacial development. Our results provide clear support for two longstanding hypotheses about adaptive radiation and demonstrate how ancient alleles maintained for millennia in distinct environmental refugia can be assembled into new adaptive combinations.","Background One major micronutrient known to have a possible protective effect against COVID-19 disease is vitamin D. This systematic review sought to identify and synthesise available evidence to aid the understanding of the possible effect of vitamin D deficiency on COVID-19 status and health outcomes in COVID-19 patients.","Large-scale efforts like the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project have made tremendous progress in cataloging the genomic binding patterns of DNA-associated proteins (DAPs), such as transcription factors (TFs). However most chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses have focused on a few immortalized cell lines whose activities and physiology deviate in important ways from endogenous cells and tissues. Consequently, binding data from primary human tissue are essential to improving our understanding of in vivo gene regulation. Here we analyze ChIP-seq data for 20 DAPs assayed in two healthy human liver tissue samples, identifying more than 450,000 binding sites. We integrated binding data with transcriptome and phased whole genome data to investigate allelic DAP interactions and the impact of heterozygous sequence variation on the expression of neighboring genes. We find our tissue-based dataset demonstrates binding patterns more consistent with liver biology than cell lines, and describe uses of these data to better prioritize impactful non-coding variation. Collectively, our rich dataset offers novel insights into genome function in healthy liver tissue and provides a valuable research resource for assessing disease-related disruptions.","Purpose Determining the triggering factor of the sudden surge of the daily new COVID-19 cases arising in most European countries during 2020 Autumn.","Background Vitamin D supplements are widely prescribed to help reduce disease risk. However, this strategy is based on findings using conventional epidemiological methods which are prone to confounding and reverse causation.","Objectives Dietary supplements may provide nutrients of relevance to ameliorate SARS-CoV-2 infection, although scientific evidence to support a role is lacking. We investigate whether the regular use of dietary supplements can reduce the risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection in around 1.4M users of the COVID Symptom Study App who completed a supplement use questionnaire.","Introduction Hansen\u2019s disease, or leprosy, is a major public health problem in developing countries, caused by Mycobacterium leprae, and affecting the skin and peripheral nerves. However, M. leprae can also affect bone tissue, mucous membranes, liver, eyes, and testicles, producing a variety of clinical phenotypes. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been expressed in the various clinical forms of leprosy and could potentially be used for its diagnosis.","Background Sunlight has been hypothesized to play a role in variation in cardiovascular disease according to geographic latitude. Objectives To evaluate the plausibility of sunlight as a factor in populations\u2019 average cholesterol and blood pressure Methods We analyzed World Health Organization data including 180 or more countries\u2019 age-standardized average cholesterol, age-standardized mean systolic blood pressure (BP), and age-standardized prevalence of raised BP, by geographic latitude, over decades. We also performed analysis by ultraviolet B light (UVB) exposure. Results Mean cholesterol increases with the distance of a country from the Equator. This relationship has changed very little since 1980. Similarly, in 1975, mean systolic BP and prevalence of raised BP were higher in countries farther from the Equator. However, the relationship between latitude and BP has changed dramatically; by 2015, the opposite pattern was observed in women. Countries\u2019 average UVB exposure has a stable relationship with cholesterol over recent decades, but a changing relationship with BP. Conclusions Since sunlight exposure in a country is relatively fixed and its relationship with BP has changed dramatically in recent decades, countries\u2019 average sunlight exposure is an unlikely explanation for contemporary country-level variation in BP. However, our findings are consistent with a putative effect of sunlight on countries\u2019 average cholesterol, as well as a no longer detectable effect on BP decades ago. A parsimonious potential explanation for the relationship between light and cholesterol is that 7-dehydrocholesterol can be converted to cholesterol, or in the presence of ultraviolet light, can instead be converted to vitamin D.","Multiple sclerosis is a neurodegenerative, autoimmune disease characterized by inrreversible neurological disability. The age at onset of multiple sclerosis is an objective and influential predictor of the evolution of multiple sclerosis independent of disease duration. Little is known about the mechanisms contributing to variation in onset age of multiple sclerosis, though HLA-DRB1*15:01, the predominant risk variant, confers an earlier onset. Here we present an age at onset genome-wide association analysis for 9.2 million variants, including gene-based and pathway enrichment analyses, for 3,495 cases who were non-Latinx white with onset \u226518 years. We investigated whether a higher burden of multiple sclerosis risk variants conferred an earlier age at onset for combinations of HLA-DRB1*15:01 alleles and quintiles of a genetic risk score for 200 risk variants that reside outside the major histocompatibility complex. The study population had a mean age at onset of 32 years, 29% was male, and 46% were HLA-DRB1*15:01 carriers. HLA-DRB1*15:01 carriers were on average one year younger at onset than non-carriers (p&lt;0.001); a similar effect was observed for a 10-risk-allele increase in the genetic risk score (p&lt;1\u00d710-8). Those in the highest genetic risk score quintile (n=717) were on average 2.5 years younger at onset than those in the lowest quintile (n=698; p=1.2\u00d710-7). For those with the greatest genetic risk burden (highest genetic risk score quintile with two HLA-DRB1*15:01 alleles) were on average five years younger at onset (p=0.002) than those with the lowest genetic risk burden (lowest genetic risk score quintile with no HLA-DRB1*15:01 alleles). There was an apparent inverse relationship between the genetic multiple sclerosis risk burden and age at onset of multiple sclerosis (p&lt;5\u00d710-8). We did not observe any individual variants reaching genome-wide significance in the genome-wide association analysis of age at onset. The most significantly associated independent genic loci (p&lt;5\u00d710-6) were located within HLA-DQB1, COL21A1, LINC01484, UBR3, and CSMD1. At the gene-level, the most significant associations (p&lt;5\u00d710-5) were for SSB, TRAFD1, HECTD2, MMP8, NAA25 and UBR3. There was an enrichment of genes involved in adaptive and innate immunity, specifically genes in the complement pathway, and genes involved in synapses and collagen biosynthesis. In summary, we demonstrated a significant gradient between elevated genetic risk burden and an earlier onset of multiple sclerosis.","TMEM173 encodes for STING that is a transmembrane protein activated by pathogen or self-derived cytosolic nucleic acids causing its translocation from ER to Golgi, and further to vesicles. Monogenic STING gain-of-function mutations cause early-onset type I interferonopathy, with disease presentation ranging from fatal vasculopathy to mild chilblain lupus. Molecular mechanisms causing the poor phenotypegenotype correlation are presently unclear. Here we report a novel gain-of-function G207E STING mutation causing a distinct phenotype with alopecia, photosensitivity, thyroid dysfunction, and STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI) -features; livedo reticularis, nasal septum perforation, facial erythema, bacterial infections and skin vasculitis. Single residue polymorphisms in TMEM173 and an IFIH1 T946 risk allele modify disease presentation in the affected multigeneration family, explaining the varying clinical phenotypes. The G207E mutation causes constitutive activation of inflammation-related pathways in HEK cells, as well as aberrant interferon signature and inflammasome activation in patient PBMCs. Protein-protein interactions further propose impaired cellular trafficking of G207E mutant STING. These findings reveal the molecular landscape of STING and highlight the complex additive effects on the phenotype.","Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) interferes with sex hormones signaling pathways (SHP). C57BL/6J mice prenatally exposed to DEHP develop a testicular dysgenesis syndrome (TDS) at adulthood, but similarly-exposed FVB/N mice are not affected. Here we aim to understand the reasons behind this drastic difference that should depend on the genome of the strain. In both backgrounds, pregnant female mice received per os either DEHP or corn oil vehicle and the male filiations were examined. Computer-assisted sperm analysis showed a DEHP-induced decreased sperm count and velocities in C57BL/6J. Sperm RNA sequencing experiments resulted in the identification of the 62 most differentially expressed RNAs. These RNAs, mainly regulated by hormones, produced strain-specific transcriptional responses to prenatal exposure to DEHP; a pool of RNAs was increased in FVB, another pool of RNAs was decreased in C57BL/6J. In FVB/N, analysis of non-synonymous SNP impacting SHP identified rs387782768 and rs387782768 respectively associated with absence of the Forkhead Box A3 (Foxa3) RNA and increased expression of estrogen receptor 1 variant 4 (NM_001302533) RNA. Analysis of the role of SNPs modifying SHP binding sites in function of strain-specific responses to DEHP revealed a DEHP-resistance allele in FVB/N containing an additional FOXA1-3 binding site at rs30973633 and four DEHP-induced beta-defensins (Defb42, Defb30, Defb47 and Defb48). A DEHP-susceptibility allele in C57BL/6J contained five SNPs (rs28279710, rs32977910, rs46648903, rs46677594 and rs48287999) affecting SHP and six genes (Svs2, Svs3b, Svs4, Svs3a, Svs6 and Svs5) epigenetically silenced by DEHP. Finally, targeted experiments confirmed increased methylation in the Svs3ab promoter with decreased SEMG2 persisting across generations, providing a molecular explanation for the transgenerational sperm velocity decrease found in C57BL/6J after DEHP exposure. We conclude that the existence of SNP-dependent mechanisms in inbred mice may confer resistance to transgenerational endocrine disruption.","Background India has recorded 66,333 deaths over 36 administrative regions placing India third in the world after the US and Brazil for COVID-19 deaths as of 2 September 2020. Studies indicate that south-west monsoon season plays a role in the dynamics of contagious diseases, which tend to peak post-monsoon season. Recent studies show that vitamin D and its primary source Ultraviolet-B radiation (UVB) may play a protective role in mitigating COVID-19 deaths. However, the combined roles of the monsoon season and UVB in COVID-19 in India are still unclear. In this observational study, we empirically study the respective roles of monsoon season and UVB, whilst further exploring, whether monsoon season negatively impacts the protective role of UVB in COVID-19 deaths in India.","Introduction Current evidence still does not support the role of vitamin B12 or vitamin D in age-associated cognitive impairment.","Background The human gut microbiota exhibits marked variation around the world, which has been attributed to dietary intake and other environmental factors. However, the degree to which ethnicity-associated differences in gut microbial community structure and function are maintained following immigration or in the context of metabolic disease is poorly understood.","Vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of developing multiple sclerosis (MS) but there is uncertainty about what dose and form of vitamin D could improve the clinical course of MS. The mechanisms underlying the effects of vitamin D in MS are not clear. Vitamin D3 increases the rate of differentiation of primary oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), suggesting that it might help remyelination in addition to modulating the immune response. Here we analyzed the transcriptome of differentiating rat CG4 OPCs treated with vitamin D2 or with D3 at 24 h and 72 h following onset of differentiation. Differentiation alone changed the expression of about 10% of the genes at 72 h compared to 24 h. Vitamin D2 and D3 exerted different effects on gene expression, with D3 influencing 1,272 genes and D2 574 at 24 h. The expression of the vast majority of these genes was either not changed in differentiating cells not exposed to vitamin D or followed the same trajectory as the latter. D3-repressed genes were enriched for gene ontology categories including transcription factors and the Notch pathway, while D3-induced genes were enriched for the Ras pathway. These findings should help to identify mechanisms mediating D3 action in MS.","In this population-based cohort of 7530 adults, combined IgG/A/M anti-Spike titres measured after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination were predictive of protection against breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection. Discrimination was significantly improved by adjustment for factors influencing risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure including household overcrowding, public transport use, and visits to indoor public places.","Hamstring muscle injury is highly prevalent in sports involving repeated maximal sprinting. Although neuromuscular fatigue is thought to be a risk factor, the mechanisms underlying the fatigue response to repeated maximal sprints are unclear. Here, we show that repeated maximal sprints induce neuromuscular fatigue accompanied with a prolonged strength loss in hamstring muscles. The immediate hamstring strength loss was linked to both central and peripheral fatigue, while prolonged strength loss was associated with indicators of muscle damage. The kinematic changes immediately after sprinting likely protected fatigued hamstrings from excess elongation stress, while larger hamstring muscle physiological cross-sectional area and lower myoblast:fibroblast ratio appeared to protect against fatigue/damage and improve muscle recovery within the first 48 h after sprinting. We have therefore identified novel mechanisms that likely regulate the fatigue/damage response and initial recovery following repeated maximal sprinting in humans.","Background The epidemiological literature reports inconsistent associations between consumption or circulating concentrations of micro-nutrients and breast cancer risk. We investigated associations between genetically determined concentrations of 11 micro-nutrients (beta-carotene, calcium, copper, folate, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, selenium, vitamin B6, vitamin B12 and zinc) and breast cancer risk using Mendelian randomization (MR).","Aim This study was conducted to explore the mechanism by which 1,25(OH)2D3 ameliorates hepatic insulin resistance in rats with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 2 diabetes.","Objectives To investigate how the relationship between vitamin D and COVID-19 has been presented in traditional media sources (UK newspapers) and assess the level of misinformation associated with this issue by comparing newspaper article content to the evidence-based guidelines.","Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) can be differentiated into adipocytes and osteoblasts. While the transcriptomic and epigenomic changes during adipogenesis and osteogenesis have been characterized, what happens to the chromatin loops is hardly known. Here we induced hMSCs to adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation, and performed 2 kb resolution Hi-C experiments for loop detection and generated RNA-seq, histone modification ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq data for integrative analysis before and after differentiation. We quantitatively identified differential contact loops and unique loops. After integrating with multi-omics data, we demonstrate that strengthened loops after differentiation are associated with gene expression activation. Specially, unique loops are linked with cell fate determination. We also proposed loop-mediated regulatory networks and identified IRS2 and RUNX2 as being activated by cell-specific loops to facilitate adipocytes and osteoblasts commitment, respectively. These results are expected to help better understand the long-range regulation in controlling hMSC differentiation, and provide novel targets for studying adipocytes and osteoblasts determination.","Background In observational studies, 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentration has been associated with an increased risk of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, it remains unclear whether this association is causal.","Background Brazil reported 123,780 deaths across 27 administrative regions, making it the second-worst affected country after the US in terms of COVID-19 deaths as of 3 September 2020. Understanding the role of weather factors in COVID-19 in Brazil is helpful in the long-term mitigation strategy of COVID-19 in other tropical countries because Brazil experienced early large-scale outbreak among tropical countries. Recent COVID-19 studies indicate that relevant weather factors such as temperature, humidity, UV Index (UVI), precipitation, ozone, pollution and cloud cover may influence the spread of COVID-19. Yet, the magnitude and direction of those associations remain inconclusive. Furthermore, there is only limited research exploring the impact of these weather factors in a tropical country like Brazil. In this observational study, we outline the roles of 7 relevant weather factors including temperature, humidity, UVI, precipitation, ozone, pollution (visibility) and cloud cover in COVID-19 death growth rates in Brazil.","We analyze risk factors correlated with the initial transmission growth rate of the recent COVID-19 pandemic in different countries. The number of cases follows in its early stages an almost exponential expansion; we chose as a starting point in each country the first day di with 30 cases and we fitted for 12 days, capturing thus the early exponential growth. We looked then for linear correlations of the exponents \u03b1 with other variables, for a sample of 126 countries. We find a positive correlation, i.e. faster spread of COVID-19, with high confidence level with the following variables, with respective p-value: low Temperature (4 \u00b7 10\u22127), high ratio of old vs. working-age people (3 \u00b7 10\u22126), life expectancy (8 \u00b7 10\u22126), number of international tourists (1\u00b7 10\u22125), earlier epidemic starting date di (2\u00b7 10\u22125), high level of physical contact in greeting habits (6 \u00b7 10\u22125), lung cancer prevalence (6 \u00b7 10\u22125), obesity in males (1\u00b7 10\u22124), share of population in urban areas (2\u00b7 10\u22124), cancer prevalence (3\u00b7 10\u22124), alcohol consumption (0.0019), daily smoking prevalence (0.0036), UV index (0.004, 73 countries). We also find a correlation with low Vitamin D serum levels (0.002\u2014 0.006), but on a smaller sample, 50 countries, to be confirmed on a larger sample. There is highly significant correlation also with blood types: positive correlation with types RH-(3\u00b7 10\u22125) and A+ (3 \u00b710\u22123), negative correlation with B+ (2 \u00b710\u22124). We also find positive correlation with moderate confidence level (p-value of 0.02\u223c 0.03) with: CO2/SO emissions, type-1 diabetes in children, low vaccination coverage for Tuberculosis (BCG). Several of the above variables are correlated with each other and so they are likely to have common interpretations. We thus performed a Principal Component Analysis, in order to find the significant independent linear combinations of such variables. We also analyzed the possible existence of a bias: countries with low GDP-per capita might have less intense testing and we discuss correlation with the above variables.","Current dietary recommendations are often generalized, conflicting, and highly subjective, depending on the source biases. This results in confusion, skepticism, and frustration in the general population. As an alternative, we propose an objective, integrated, automated, algorithmic approach to diet and supplement recommendations that is powered by artificial intelligence that analyzes individualized molecular data from the gut microbiome, the human host, and their interactions. This platform enables precise, personalized, and data-driven nutritional recommendations that consist of foods and supplements, based on the individual molecular data, to support healthy homeostasis. We describe the application of this precision technology platform to populations with depression, anxiety, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and type 2 diabetes (T2D). We show that our precision nutritional recommendations resulted in improvements in clinical outcomes by 36% in severe cases of depression, 40% in severe cases of anxiety, 38% in severe cases of IBS, and more than 30% in the T2D risk score which was validated against clinical measurement of HbA1c. Our data support the integration of precision food and supplements into the standard of care for these chronic conditions.","Background Vitamin D has numerous mechanistic roles within the immune system. There is increasing evidence to suggest Vitamin D deficiency may increase individuals\u2019 risk of COVID-19 infection and susceptibility. We aimed to determine the relationship between severity of vitamin D deficiency and sufficiency and COVID-19 infection within healthcare workers.","Human bone marrow (BM) derived stromal cells contain a population of skeletal stem cells (SSCs), with the capacity to differentiate along the osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic lineages enabling their application to clinical therapies. However, current methods, to isolate and enrich SSCs from human tissues remain, at best, challenging in the absence of a specific SSC marker. Unfortunately, none of the current proposed markers, alone, can isolate a homogenous cell population with the ability to form bone, cartilage, and adipose tissue in humans. Here, we have designed DNA-gold nanoparticles able to identify and sort SSCs displaying specific mRNA signatures. The current approach demonstrates the significant enrichment attained in the isolation of SSCs, with potential therein to enhance our understanding of bone cell biology and translational applications.","The evolutionary origins of human-associated bacteriophage communities are poorly understood. To address this question, we examined fecal phageomes of 23 wild non-human primate taxa, including multiple representatives of all the major primate radiations, and find relatives of the majority of human-associated phages. Primate taxa have distinct phageome compositions that exhibit a clear phylosymbiotic signal, and phage-superhost co-divergence is detected for 44 individual phages. Within species, neighboring social groups harbor evolutionarily and compositionally distinct phageomes, structured by superhost social behavior. However, captive non-human primate phageomes are more similar to humans than their wild counterparts, revealing replacement of wild-associated phages with human-associated ones. Together, our results suggest that potentially labile primate-phage associations persisted across millions of years of evolution, potentially facilitated by transmission between groupmates.","Selection on standing genetic variation is important for rapid local genetic adaptation when the environment changes. We report that, for the prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) gene, different populations have different target haplotypes, even though haplotypes are not unique to specific populations. The C-C-A haplotype, whereby the first C is located at rs2294008 of PSCA and is a low risk allele for gastric cancer, has become a target of positive selection mainly in Asian populations. Conversely, the C-A-G haplotype carrying the same C allele has become a selection target in African populations. However, Asian and African populations share both haplotypes, consistent with the haplotype divergence time (170 kya) prior to out-of-Africa. The frequency of C-C-A/C-A-G is 0.344/0.278 in Asia and 0.209/0.416 in Africa. 2D-SFS analysis revealed that the extent of intra-allelic variability of the target haplotype is extremely small in each local population, suggesting that C-C-A or C-A-G is under ongoing hard sweeps in local populations. From the TMRCA of selected haplotypes, the estimated onset times of positive selection were recent (3-55 kya), concurrently with population subdivision from a common ancestor. Additionally, estimated selection coefficients from ABC analysis were up to ~3%, similar to those at other loci under recent positive selection on standing genetic variation. Phylogeny of local populations and TMRCA of selected haplotypes revealed that spatial and temporal switching of positive selection targets is a unique and novel feature of ongoing positive selection at PSCA. This switching may reflect potential of rapid adaptability to distinct environments.","Ancient human migrations led to the settlement of population groups in varied environmental contexts worldwide. The extent to which adaptation to local environments has shaped human genetic diversity is a longstanding question in human evolution. Recent studies have suggested that introgression of archaic alleles in the genome of modern humans may have contributed to adaptation to environmental pressures such as pathogen exposure. Functional genomic studies have demonstrated that variation in gene expression across individuals and in response to environmental perturbations is a main mechanism underlying complex trait variation. We considered gene expression response to in vitro treatments as a molecular phenotype to identify genes and regulatory variants that may have played an important role in adaptations to local environments. We investigated if Neanderthal introgression in the human genome may contribute to the transcriptional response to environmental perturbations. To this end we used eQTLs for genes differentially expressed in a panel of 52 cellular environments, resulting from 5 cell types and 26 treatments, including hormones, vitamins, drugs, and environmental contaminants. We found that SNPs with introgressed Neanderthal alleles (N-SNPs) disrupt binding of transcription factors important for environmental responses, including ionizing radiation and hypoxia, and for glucose metabolism. We identified an enrichment for N-SNPs among eQTLs for genes differentially expressed in response to 8 treatments, including glucocorticoids, caffeine, and vitamin D. Using Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRA) data, we validated the regulatory function of 21 introgressed Neanderthal variants in the human genome, corresponding to 8 eQTLs regulating 15 genes that respond to environmental perturbations. These findings expand the set of environments where archaic introgression may have contributed to adaptations to local environments in modern humans and provide experimental validation for the regulatory function of introgressed variants.","Background The gut microbiome may play a role in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric diseases including major depressive disorder (MDD). Bile acids (BAs) are steroid acids that are synthesized in the liver from cholesterol and further processed by gut-bacterial enzymes, thus requiring both human and gut microbiome enzymatic processes in their metabolism. BAs participate in a range of important host functions such as lipid transport and metabolism, cellular signaling and regulation of energy homeostasis. BAs have recently been implicated in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer\u2019s and several other neuropsychiatric diseases, but the biochemical underpinnings of these gut microbiome-linked metabolites in the pathophysiology of depression and anxiety remains largely unknown.","EDAR is a TNF receptor family member with roles in the development and growth of hair, teeth and glands. A derived allele of EDAR, single nucleotide variant rs3827760, encodes EDAR370A, a receptor with more potent signalling effects than the ancestral EDAR370V. This allele of rs3827760 is at very high frequency in modern East Asian and Native American populations as a result of ancient positive selection and has been associated with straighter, thicker hair fibres, alteration of tooth and ear shape, reduced chin protrusion and increased fingertip sweat gland density. Here we report the characterisation of another SNV in EDAR, rs146567337, encoding EDAR380R. The derived allele of this SNV is at its highest global frequency, of up to 5%, in populations of southern China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia. Using haplotype analyses, we find that the rs3827760 and rs146567337 SNVs arose on distinct haplotypes and that rs146567337 does not show the same signs of positive selection as rs3827760. From functional studies in cultured cells, we find that EDAR380R displays increased EDAR signalling output, at a similar level to that of EDAR370A. The existence of a second SNV with partly overlapping geographic distribution, the same in vitro functional effect and similar evolutionary age as the derived allele of rs3827760, but of independent origin and not exhibiting the same signs of strong selection, suggests a northern focus of positive selection on EDAR function in East Asia.","In the last decade, genome-scale metabolic models have been increasingly used to study plant metabolic behavior at the tissue and multi-tissue level under different environmental conditions. Quercus suber, also known as the cork oak tree, is one of the most important forest communities of the Mediterranean/Iberian region. In this work, we present the genome-scale metabolic model of the Q. suber (iEC7871), the first of a woody plant. The metabolic model comprises 7871 genes, 6231 reactions, and 6481 metabolites across eight compartments. Transcriptomics data was integrated into the model to obtain tissue-specific models for the leaf, inner bark, and phellogen, with specific biomass compositions. The tissue-specific models were merged into a diel multi-tissue metabolic model to predict interactions among the three tissues at the light and dark phases. The metabolic models were also used to analyze the pathways associated with the synthesis of suberin monomers. Nevertheless, the models developed in this work can provide insights into other aspects of the metabolism of Q. suber, such as its secondary metabolism and cork formation.","We report the frequencies of linear enamel hypoplasia (LEH) and, specifically, pitting enamel hypoplasia (PEH) defects in the teeth of Paranthropus robustus, for comparison with four other South African hominin species and three extant nonhuman primate species. Unlike LEH, the lesser known PEH is characterized by multiple circular depression defects across a tooth crown and is often difficult to interpret in terms of developmental timing and etiology. Teeth in all samples were examined macroscopically with type, position and number of defects recorded. Frequencies of teeth with LEH vary among hominin species, but the differences in PEH are considerable. That is, P. robustus has much higher rates of pitting defects, with 47% of deciduous teeth and 14% of permanent teeth affected, relative to 6.7% and 4.3%, respectively, for all other hominin teeth combined; none of the extant primate samples evidence comparable rates. The defects on P. robustus molars are unlike those in other species, with entire crowns often covered in small circular depressions. The PEH is most consistent with modern human examples of amelogenesis imperfecta. Additionally, the defects are: 1) not found on anterior teeth, 2) uniform in shape and size, and 3) similar in appearance/severity on all molars. A possible reason for this form of PEH is as a side effect of selection on another phenotype that shares the same coding gene(s), i.e., a genetic origin. Recent research on the ENAM gene provides one such possibility. Paranthropus likely underwent rapid evolution in the ENAM loci, with changes in this gene contributing to larger posterior teeth and thicker enamel. This same gene is associated with amelogenesis imperfecta; therefore, pleiotropy effects, relating to high selection on this gene during Paranthropus evolution, could have yielded this unique condition.","Background Vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased risk of multiple sclerosis (MS). However, its effect on the age of disease onset remains unclear. This study examines the relationship between serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels and age of first symptom onset among recently diagnosed MS patients.","Peripheral nerves and their axons are shielded by the blood-nerve and the myelin barrier, but understanding of how these barriers impact nociception is limited. Here, we identified a regulatory axis of the tight junction protein claudin-12, sex-dependently controlling perineurial and myelin barrier integrity. In nerve biopsies, claudin-12 in Schwann cells was lost in male and postmenopausal female patients with painful but not painless polyneuropathy. Global Cldn12 gene-knockout selectively increased perineurial/myelin barrier leakage, damaged tight junction protein expression and morphology, increased proinflammatory cytokines and induced mechanical hypersensitivity in na\u00efve and neuropathic male mice, respectively. Other barriers and neurological function remained intact. In vitro transfection studies documented claudin-12 plasma membrane localisation without interaction with other tight junction proteins or intrinsic sealing properties. Rather, claudin-12 had a regulatory tight junction protein function on the myelin barrier via the morphogen SHH in vivo in Cldn12-KO and after local siRNA knockdown. Fertile female mice were completely protected. Collectively, these studies reveal the critical role of claudin-12 maintaining the myelin barrier and highlight restoration of the claudin-12/SHH pathway as a potential target for painful neuropathy.","The first COVID-19 case in Mexico was confirmed on 26 February 2020 and by May 3 the number of registered cases had risen to 30,927. However the rate of transmission varied greatly from city to city. We used data on temperature, humidity and ultraviolet radiation (UV) from 45 cities all over the country to explore whether there was an association between these variables and rates of transmission and rates of accumulation of COVID-19 ascribed deaths. The advantage of an in-country study of this kind is that many of the variables that can confound international studies are held constant (e.g. public health policies, methods of reporting, cultural, behavioural and genetic factors). Although the official statistics undoubtedly greatly underestimate the situation in Mexico due to lack of testing, they are underestimated in all cities so this should not introduce bias across the sample. We found that temperature and humidity had no discernible association with transmission rates but that UV during the transmission period was negatively correlated with rates of transmission, suggesting a sterilizing effect. UV in the January preceding the epidemic had a slightly higher association with transmission rates than UV during the transmission period itself. We also found negative associations of UV in the transmission period and in January with rate of cumulative deaths, but at lower levels of statistical significance. We conclude that in addition to a sterilizing effect during the transmission period, UV may have a physiological effect in reducing transmission and deaths due to COVID-19, most likely through the medium of vitamin D production in the body. This follows the growing body of medical evidence that vitamin D deficiency is associated with severity of COVID-19. However, we also found a negative correlation between altitude and rates of COVID-19 transmission, distinct and independent of the UV effect, which may indicate that other physiological processes are also present. In a multiple regression, altitude and UV together accounted for 18% of the variation in transmission rates between cities.","We present a compartment model that explains melanoma cell response and resistance to mono and combination therapies. Model parameters were estimated by utilizing an optimization algorithm to identify parameters that minimized the difference between predicted cell populations and experimentally measured cell numbers. The model was then validated with in vitro experimental data. Our simulations show that although a specific timing of the combination therapy is effective in controlling tumor cell populations over an extended period of time, the treatment eventually fails. We subsequently predict a more optimal combination therapy that incorporates an additional drug at the right moment.","Localized non-inheritable developmental defects of tooth enamel (DDE) are classified as enamel hypoplasia (EH), opacity (OP) and post-eruptive breakdown (PEB) using the Enamel Defects Index. To better understand the etiology of DDE, and in particular possibly modifiable variables, we assessed the linkages amongst exposome variables during the specific time duration of the development of the DDE. In general, the human primary central maxillary incisor teeth develop between 13-14 weeks in utero and 3-4 weeks\u2019 postpartum of a full-term delivery, followed by tooth eruption at about 1 year of age. We utilized existing datasets of mother and child dyad data that encompassed 12 weeks\u2019 gestation through birth and early infancy, and child DDE outcomes from digital images of the erupted primary maxillary central incisor teeth. We applied a Bayesian modeling paradigm to assess the important predictors of EH, OP, and PEB. The results of Gibbs variable selection showed a key set of predictors: mother\u2019s pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI); maternal serum levels of calcium and phosphorus at gestational week 28; child\u2019s gestational age; and both mother\u2019s and child\u2019s functional vitamin D deficiency (FVDD). In this sample of healthy mothers and children, significant predictors for OP included the child having a gestational period &gt; 36 weeks and FVDD at birth, and for PEB included a mother\u2019s pre-pregnancy BMI &lt; 21.5 and higher serum phosphorus level at week 28.","Objectives Until recently, randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses have not demonstrated convincing conclusions regarding the association of calcium intake with bone mineral density (BMD). Until now, it remains unclear whether high serum calcium levels are causally associated with BMD. This study aimed to investigate the genetic association between serum calcium levels and BMD using a large-scale serum calcium GWAS dataset and four large-scale BMD GWAS datasets in individuals of European descent.","Clinical mastitis (CM) is an inflammatory disease occurring in the mammary glands of lactating cows. CM is under genetic control, and a prominent CM resistance QTL located on chromosome 6 was reported in various dairy cattle breeds. Nevertheless, the biological mechanism underpinning this QTL has been lacking. Herein, we mapped, fine-mapped, and discovered the putative causal variant underlying this CM resistance QTL in the Dutch dairy cattle population. We identified a ~12 kb multi-allelic copy number variant (CNV), that is in perfect linkage disequilibrium with a GWAS lead SNP, as a promising candidate variant. By implementing a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and through expression QTL mapping, we showed that the group-specific component gene (GC), a gene encoding a vitamin D binding protein, is an excellent candidate causal gene for the QTL. The multiplicated alleles are associated with increased GC expression and low CM resistance. Ample evidence from functional genomics data supports the presence of an enhancer within this CNV, which would exert cis-regulatory effect on GC. We observed that strong positive selection swept the region near the CNV, and haplotypes associated with the multiplicated allele were strongly selected for. Moreover, the multiplicated allele showed pleiotropic effects for increased milk yield and reduced fertility, hinting that a shared underlying biology for these effects may revolve around the vitamin D pathway. These findings together suggest a putative causal variant of a CM resistance QTL, where a cis-regulatory element located within a CNV can alter gene expression and affect multiple economically important traits.","Background Despite effective means to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection, the early treatment seeking behavior of those newly diagnosed with infection is not clear.","Background We set out in this paper to compare Covid-19 results by country to better understand the factors leading to the differing results found internationally.","Objective Epidemiological studies suggest vitamin D deficiency as a potential risk factor for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) development, a chronic autoimmune disorder highly prevalent in indigenous North American (INA) population. We therefore profiled the circulating levels of 25-hydroxyvitaminD [25(OH)D], an active metabolite of vitamin D, in a cohort of at-risk first-degree relatives (FDR) of INA RA patients, a subset of whom subsequently developed RA (progressors).","BACKGROUND Cadmium (Cd) is a toxic, pro-inflammatory metal ubiquitous in the diet that accumulates in body organs due to inefficient elimination. Many individuals exposed to dietary Cd are also infected by seasonal influenza virus. The H1N1 strain causes mild to severe pneumonia which can be fatal.","Determining the contribution of elevated ultraviolet-B radiation (UVBR; 280 \u2013 315 nm) to amphibian population declines is being hindered by a lack of knowledge about how different acute UVBR exposure regimes during early life history stages might affect post-metamorphic stages via long-term carryover effects. We acutely exposed tadpoles of the Australian green tree frog (Litoria caerulea) to a combination of different UVBR irradiances and doses in a multi-factorial experiment, and then reared them to metamorphosis in the absence of UVBR to assess carryover effects in subsequent juvenile frogs. Dose and irradiance of acute UVBR exposure influenced carryover effects into metamorphosis in somewhat opposing manners. Higher doses of UVBR exposure in larvae yielded improved rates of metamorphosis. However, exposure at a high irradiance resulted in frogs metamorphosing smaller in size and in poorer condition than frogs exposed to low and medium irradiance UVBR as larvae. We also demonstrate some of the first empirical evidence of UVBR-induced telomere shortening in vivo, which is one possible mechanism for life-history trade-offs impacting condition post-metamorphosis. These findings contribute to our understanding of how acute UVBR exposure regimes in early life affect later life-history stages, which has implications for how this stressor may shape population dynamics.","Vitamin D functions as a potent immunomodulator by interacting with many immune cells however, its role in regulating inflammation in the epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is unclear. In the EAT of atherosclerotic microswine that were fed with deficient, sufficient or supplemented levels of vitamin D, we evaluated the phenotype of the macrophages. Vitamin D treatment was continued for 12 months and serum 25(OH)D levels were measured regularly. Infiltration of M1/M2 macrophage was investigated by immunostaining for CCR7 and CD206, respectively in conjunction with a pan macrophage marker CD14. Significant difference in the number of CCR7+ cells was observed in the EAT from vitamin D-deficient swine compared to vitamin D-sufficient or -supplemented swine. Expression of CD206 correlated with high levels of serum 25(OH)D indicating a significant increase in M2 macrophages in the EAT of vitamin D-supplemented compared to -deficient swine. These findings suggest that vitamin D-deficiency exacerbates inflammation by increasing pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages, while vitamin D-supplementation attenuates the inflammatory cytokines and promotes M2 macrophages in EAT. This study demonstrates the significance of vitamin D mediated inhibition of macrophage mediated inflammation in the EAT during coronary intervention in addition to its immunomodulatory role. However, additional studies are required to identify the cellular mechanisms that transduce signals between macrophages and smooth muscle cells during restenosis in the presence and absence of vitamin D.","Large numbers of statistically significant associations between sentinel SNPs and case-control status have been replicated by genome-wide association studies. Nevertheless, few underlying molecular mechanisms of complex disease are currently known. We investigated whether variation in binding of a transcription factor, the vitamin D receptor (VDR) whose activating ligand vitamin D has been proposed as a modifiable factor in multiple disorders, could explain any of these associations. VDR modifies gene expression by binding DNA as a heterodimer with the Retinoid X receptor (RXR).","Background Vitamin D has been widely promoted for bone health through supplementation and fortification of the general population. However, there is growing evidence that does not support these strategies. Our aim is to review the quality and recommendations on vitamin D nutritional and clinical practice guidelines and explore predictive factors for their direction and strength.","Background Every year, millions of people are hospitalized, and thousands die from influenza A virus (FLUAV) infection. Most cases of hospitalizations and death occur among elderly. Many of these elderly patients are reliant on medical treatment of underlying chronic diseases, such as arthritis, diabetes, and hypertension. We hypothesized that the commonly prescribed medicines for treatment of underlying chronic diseases can affect host responses to FLUAV infection, and thus contribute to morbidity and mortality associated with influenza. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine whether commonly prescribed medicines could affect host responses to virus infection in vitro.","The study reviews the evidence presented in a recent study linking vitamin D levels and Covid-19 infection and mortality. It was argued that correlation alone may not be useful in establishing a relationship between vitamin D levels and Covid-19 infections and mortality. Appropriate controls need to be included for improved understanding of the relationship. We proposed life expectancy as a potential control. Including this control in a regression model, we find that vitamin D levels are not a statistically significant predictor of Covid-19 infections or mortality. Life expectancy, on the other hand, was found to be statistically significant predictor of infections and mortality at country level.","Background Untreated sleep disorders have been linked with type 2 diabetes in previous evidence. This study was to investigate the correlation between serum 25(OH) vitamin D level and sleep quality in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes and reveal the therapeutic potential of 25(OH) vitamin D-based treatments to improve sleeping quality and its effect on diabetes management.","Background Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can be related to airway remodeling caused by pulmonary fibrosis and systemic inflammation. Etiologies of ARDS are multifaceted such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or as recently the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Antifibrotic drugs may be a better approach to slow the fibrotic process but they often have poor efficacy in patients, and the mortality rate remains high, up to 40% within 5 years of diagnosis.","Background Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination vary for reasons that remain poorly understood.","Sterols are crucial components of biological membranes that help maintain membrane integrity and regulate various processes such as endocytosis, protein oligomerization and signaling. Although synthetized in the ER, sterols are at highest concentrations at the plasma membrane (PM) in all eukaryotic organisms. Here, by applying a genetically encoded sterol biosensor (D4H), we visualize a sterol flow between PM and endosomes in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. While D4H is detected at the PM during steady-state growth, inhibition of Arp2/3-dependent F-actin assembly unexpectedly promotes the reversible re-localization of the probe to internal sterol rich compartments (STRIC), as shown by correlative light-electron microscopy. Time-lapse imaging identifies STRIC as a late secretory, endosomal compartment labelled by the synaptobrevin Syb1. Retrograde sterol internalization to STRIC is independent of endocytosis or an intact Golgi. Instead, it depends on Ltc1, a LAM/StARkin-family protein that localizes to ER-PM contact sites. In ltc1\u0394, sterols over-accumulate at the PM, which forms extended ER-interacting invaginations, indicating that sterol transfer by Ltc1 contributes to PM size homeostasis. Anterograde sterol movement from STRIC is independent of canonical vesicular trafficking components but requires Arp2/3 activity, suggesting a novel physiological role for this complex. Thus, transfer routes orthogonal to vesicular trafficking govern the retrograde and anterograde flow of sterols in the cell.","Regenerated cartilage formed after Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation may be of suboptimal quality due to postulated hypertrophic changes. Parathyroid hormone-related peptide, containing the parathyroid hormone sequence (PTHrP 1-34), enhances cartilage growth during development and inhibits hypertrophic differentiation of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and growth plate chondrocytes. This study aims to determine whether human articular chondrocytes respond correspondingly. Healthy human articular cartilage-derived chondrocytes (n=6 donors) were cultured on type II collagen-coated transwells with/without 0.1 or 1.0 \u03bcM PTH from day 0, 9, or 21 until the end of culture (day 28). Extracellular matrix production, (pre)hypertrophy and PTH signaling were assessed by RT-qPCR and/or immunohistochemistry for collagen type I, II, X, RUNX2, MMP13, PTHR1 and IHH and by determining glycosaminoglycan production and DNA content. The Bern score assessed cartilage quality by histology. Regardless of the concentration and initiation of supplementation, PTH treatment significantly decreased DNA and glycosaminoglycan content and reduced the Bern score compared with controls. Type I collagen deposition was increased, whereas PTHR1 expression and type II collagen deposition were decreased by PTH supplementation. Expression of the (pre)hypertrophic markers MMP13, RUNX2, IHH and type X collagen were not affected by PTH. In conclusion, PTH supplementation to healthy human articular chondrocytes did not affect hypertrophic differentiation, but negatively influenced cartilage quality, the tissues\u2019 extracellular matrix and cell content. Although PTH may be an effective inhibitor of hypertrophic differentiation in MSC-based cartilage repair, care may be warranted in applying accessory PTH treatment due to its effects on articular chondrocytes.","The TP63 gene encodes the transcription factor p63. It is frequently amplified or overexpressed in squamous cell carcinomas. Owing to alternative splicing, p63 has multiple isoforms called \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 and \u03b4. The regulatory functions of p63 may be isoform-specific. The \u03b1 isoform inhibits the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and controls apoptosis, while the \u03b3 isoform promotes EMT. Here, we observed in TCGA data that a high ratio of the TP63\u03b3 isoform to the other isoforms is a pejorative factor for the survival of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). We therefore addressed the regulation of the \u03b3 isoform. In several tissues (GTEX data), the expression of the RNA-binding protein PTBP1 (polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1) is negatively correlated with the abundance of TP63\u03b3. Accordingly, we demonstrated that PTBP1 depletion in HNSCC cell lines leads to an increase in abundance of the \u03b3 isoform. By RNA immunoprecipitation and in vitro interaction assays, we showed that PTBP1 directly binds to TP63 pre-mRNA in close proximity to the TP63\u03b3-specific exon. The region around the TP63\u03b3-specific exon was sufficient to elicit a PTBP1-dependent regulation of alternative splicing in a splice reporter minigene assay. Finally, we demonstrated that the regulation of TP63\u03b3 production by PTBP1 is conserved in amphibians, revealing that it encounters a strong evolutionary pressure. Together, these results identify TP63\u03b3 as a prognostic marker in HNSCC, and identify PTBP1 as a direct negative regulator of its production.","A randomized controlled trial of calcifediol (25-hydroxyvitamin D3) as a treatment for hospitalized COVID-19 patients in C\u00f3rdoba, Spain, found that the treatment was associated with reduced ICU admissions with very large effect size and high statistical significance, but the study has had limited impact because it had only 76 patients and imperfect blinding, and did not measure vitamin D levels pre- and post-treatment or adjust for several comorbidities. Here we reanalyze the reported results of the study using rigorous and well established statistical techniques, and find that the randomization, large effect size, and high statistical significance address many of these concerns. We show that random assignment of patients to treatment and control groups is highly unlikely to distribute comorbidities or other prognostic indicators sufficiently unevenly to account for the large effect size. We also show that imperfect blinding would need to have had an implausibly large effect to account for the reported results. Finally, comparison with two additional randomized clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation for COVID-19 in India and Brazil indicates that early intervention and rapid absorption may be crucial for the observed benefits of vitamin D. We conclude that the C\u00f3rdoba study provides sufficient evidence to warrant immediate, well-designed pivotal clinical trials of early calcifediol administration in a broader cohort of inpatients and outpatients with COVID-19.","Importance Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a neuro-inflammatory disorder caused by a combination of environmental exposures and genetic risk factors. We sought to determine whether genetic risk modifies the effect of environmental MS risk factors.","The human kidney is composed of over 26 cell types that actively coordinate with each other to form higher-order structures, such as the nephron. It is not yet understood how these structures vary throughout a single organ or amongst the same organs within the human population. We have developed an extensive lipid and cellular atlas of the human kidney consisting of over 3 million cells comprising 75,000 functional tissue units (i.e., glomeruli, proximal tubules, distal tubules, and collecting ducts) from 13 human subjects. This atlas was developed using spatially registered and integrated technologies consisting of imaging mass spectrometry, multiplexed immunofluorescence, stained microscopy, and autofluorescence microscopy, to comprehensively probe large (i.e., centimeter-sized) areas of tissue. The cellular organization and lipid profiles of glomeruli, proximal tubules, distal tubules, and collecting ducts were discovered through these multimodal imaging data as well as their intra- and inter-subject variance. Relating the lipid profiles obtained from imaging mass spectrometry to distinct cell types obtained from immunofluorescence allowed us to hypothesize the functional role of specific phospholipids that have not previously been described. These hypotheses include subject characteristics, such as BMI and sex. The integrated data from the aforementioned datasets provide a valuable reference for kidney researchers, are publicly available through the NIH Human Biomolecular Atlas Program (https://portal.hubmapconsortium.org/), and discussed below.","Background and Objectives Many studies have examined the relation between PD and environmental variables serially --- one candidate association at a time. In the real world however, both environmental exposures and patients are much more complex, including correlated environmental exposures, polypharmacy, and complex comorbidities. Here we begin to characterize a holistic view of environmental, health, and pharmacological traits linked to patients with PD.","Objective Although many observational studies have shown that there was an inverse association between birth weight and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adults, whether such association is causal remains largely unclear.","Background The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of prolonged fasting (10 days) in the vitamin D, B12 levels, body mass index (BMI), weight, hemoglobin, vitality and quality of life (QoL) compared to normal diet.","Background and Objectives: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects \u223c20% of older adults and secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) is a common condition in these patients. Studies have linked HPT to a greater risk of fractures, vascular events and mortality. However, the optimal parathyroid hormone (PTH) level needed to minimize these events remains uncertain.","About 1\u20132% of European population are redhaired, meaning they synthesize more pheomelanin than eumelanin, the main melanin pigment. Several mutations could be responsible for this phenotype. It has been suggested that corresponding mutations spread in Europe due to a founder effect shaped either by a relaxation of selection for dark, UV-protective phenotypes or by sexual selection in favor of rare phenotypes. In our study, we investigated the levels of vitamin D precursor calcidiol and folic acid in the blood serum of 73 redhaired and 130 non-redhaired individuals. In redhaired individuals, we found higher calcidiol concentrations and approximately the same folic acid concentrations as in non-redhaired subjects. Calcidiol concentrations correlated with the intensity of hair redness measured by two spectrophotometric methods and estimated by participants themselves and by independent observers. In non-redhaired individuals, calcidiol levels covaried with the amount of sun exposure and intensity of suntan while in redhaired individuals, this was not the case. It suggests that increased calcidiol levels in redhaired individuals are due to differences in physiology rather than in behavior. We also found that folic acid levels increased with age and the intensity of baldness and decreased with the frequency of visiting tanning salons. Our results suggest that the redhaired phenotype could be an evolutionary adaptation for sufficient photosynthesis of provitamin D in conditions of low intensity of UV-B radiation in central and northern parts of Europe.","Several observational studies indicate that dietary habits in children and adolescents are associated with school performance. These associations are heavily confounded by socio-economic characteristics, such as household income and parents\u2019 educational attainment, amongst other factors. In this study, we report observational and causal effects of habitual diet on school performance, using individual level data for 9,220 adolescents in the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986. For this purpose, we derived principal components for the dietary variables, meal patterns and school performance variables. The observational study showed a significant association of consumption of foods that are high in fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) with poor performance in all school subjects, and an association of consumption of healthy foods and traditional foods with good school performance in general subjects, science and physical education (PE). Moreover, a positive association was observed between not skipping breakfast and good performance in all school subjects. Mendelian randomisation analysis confirmed a negative effect of HFSS on school performance in general/science subjects (\u22120.080, \u22120.128 to \u22120.033) and a positive effect of healthy food on school performance in general/science subjects (0.071, 0.024 to 0.119) and PE (0.065, 0.021 to 0.110). To conclude, we identified compelling evidence that HFSS foods and healthy foods were causally affecting school performance.","Laboratory experiments have revealed the meteorological sensitivity of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) virus. However, no consensus has been reached about how outdoor meteorological conditions modulate the virus transmission as it is also constrained by non-meteorological conditions. Here, we find that statistically, non-meteorological factors constrain the growth rate of cumulative confirmed cases least when the cases in a country arrive around 1300\u20133200. The least-constrained growth rate correlates with the ultraviolet flux and temperature significantly (correlation coefficients r=-0.55\u00b10.09 and -0.40\u00b10.10 at p &lt; 0.01, respectively), but not with precipitation, humidity, and wind. The ultraviolet correlation exhibits a delay of about seven days, providing a meteorological measure of the incubation period. Our work reveals a seasonality of COVID-19 and a high risk of a pandemic resurgence in winter, implying a need for seasonal adaption in public policies.","Fine-mapping aims to identify causal variants impacting complex traits. Several recent methods improve fine-mapping accuracy by prioritizing variants in enriched functional annotations. However, these methods can only use information at genome-wide significant loci (or a small number of functional annotations), severely limiting the benefit of functional data. We propose PolyFun, a computationally scalable framework to improve fine-mapping accuracy using genome-wide functional data for a broad set of coding, conserved, regulatory and LD-related annotations. PolyFun prioritizes variants in enriched functional annotations by specifying prior causal probabilities for fine-mapping methods such as SuSiE or FINEMAP, employing special procedures to ensure robustness to model misspecification and winner\u2019s curse. In simulations with in-sample LD, PolyFun + SuSiE and PolyFun + FINEMAP were well-calibrated and identified &gt;20% more variants with posterior causal probability &gt;0.95 than their non-functionally informed counterparts (and &gt;33% more fine-mapped variants than previous functionally-informed fine-mapping methods). In simulations with mismatched reference LD, PolyFun + SuSiE remained well-calibrated when reducing the maximum number of assumed causal SNPs per locus, which reduces absolute power but still produces large relative improvements. In analyses of 49 UK Biobank traits (average N=318K) with in-sample LD, PolyFun + SuSiE identified 3,025 fine-mapped variant-trait pairs with posterior causal probability &gt;0.95, a &gt;32% improvement vs. SuSiE; 223 variants were fine-mapped for multiple genetically uncorrelated traits, indicating pervasive pleiotropy. We used posterior mean per-SNP heritabilities from PolyFun + SuSiE to perform polygenic localization, constructing minimal sets of common SNPs causally explaining 50% of common SNP heritability; these sets ranged in size from 28 (hair color) to 3,400 (height) to 2 million (number of children). In conclusion, PolyFun prioritizes variants for functional follow-up and provides insights into complex trait architectures.","The molecular bases of how host genetic variation impact gut microbiome remain largely unknown. Here, we used a genetically diverse mouse population and systems genetics strategies to identify interactions between molecular phenotypes, including microbial functions, intestinal transcripts and cecal lipids that influence microbe-host dynamics. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis identified genomic regions associated with variations in bacterial taxa, bacterial functions, including motility, sporulation and lipopolysaccharide production, and levels of bacterial- and host-derived lipids. We found overlapping QTL for the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila and cecal levels of ornithine lipids (OL). Follow-up studies revealed that A. muciniphila is a major source of these lipids in the gut, provided evidence that OL have immunomodulatory effects and identified intestinal transcripts co-regulated with these traits. Collectively, these results suggest that OL are key players in A. muciniphila-host interactions and support the role of host genetics as a determinant of responses to gut microbes.","Ethnic minorities in developed countries suffer a disproportionately high burden of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, and COVID-19 ethnic disparities have been attributed to social determinants of health. Vitamin D has been proposed as a modifiable risk factor that could mitigate COVID-19 health disparities. We investigated the relationship between vitamin D and COVID-19 susceptibility and severity using the UK Biobank, a large progressive cohort study of the United Kingdom population. Structural equation modelling was used to evaluate the ability of vitamin D, socioeconomic deprivation, and other known risk factors to mediate COVID-19 ethnic health disparities. Asian ethnicity is associated with higher COVID-19 susceptibility, compared to the majority White population, and Asian and Black ethnicity are both associated with higher COVID-19 severity. Socioeconomic deprivation mediates all three ethnic disparities and shows the highest overall signal of mediation for any COVID-19 risk factor. Vitamin supplements, including vitamin D, mediate the Asian disparity in COVID-19 susceptibility, and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (calcifediol) levels mediate Asian and Black COVID-19 severity disparities. Several measures of overall health also mediate COVID-19 ethnic disparities, underscoring the importance of comorbidities. Our results support ethnic minorities\u2019 use of vitamin D as both a prophylactic and a supplemental therapeutic for COVID-19.","Background Klebsiella pneumoniae and closely related species K. variicola and K. quasipneumoniae are common causes of healthcare-associated infections, and patients frequently become infected with their intestinal colonizing strain. To assess the association between Klebsiella colonization density and subsequent infections, a case-control study was performed.","Haplotypes defined by rs7041/rs4588 in GC gene modulate 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) levels. To investigate the distributions of GC polymorphisms, the rs7041 and rs4588 allele and haplotypes frequencies were analyzed in samples from different Eurasian regions. The GC1S haplotype associated with high level of serum 25(OH)D had the maximum frequency in European populations (except Finish population). Such frequency distributions may be a result of adaptation to low solar insolation rate. Besides, there was a strong trend of increasing GC1F haplotype frequency from Europe (10-15%) to Siberia and Easter Asia (40-45%).","Background and objective The effect of calcium supplementation on bone mineral accretion in people under 35 years old is inconclusive. To comprehensively summarize the evidence for the effect of calcium supplementation on bone mineral accretion in young populations (\u226435 years).","Background Detailed modelling of the neutral mutational process in cancer cells is crucial for identifying driver mutations and understanding the mutational mechanisms that act during cancer development. The neutral mutational process is very complex: whole-genome analyses have revealed that the mutation rate differs between cancer types, between patients and along the genome depending on the genetic and epigenetic context. Therefore, methods that predict the number of different types of mutations in regions or specific genomic elements must consider local genomic explanatory variables. A major drawback of most methods is the need to average the explanatory variables across the entire region or genomic element. This procedure is particularly problematic if the explanatory variable varies dramatically in the element under consideration.","COVID-19 is a severe respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, a novel human coronavirus. The host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is not clearly understood. Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibit heterogeneous intensity of symptoms, i.e., asymptomatic, mild, and severe. Moreover, effects on organs also vary from person to person. These heterogeneous responses pose pragmatic hurdles for implementing appropriate therapy and management of COVID-19 patients. Post-COVID complications pose another major challenge in managing the health of these patients. Thus, understanding the impact of disease severity at the molecular level is vital to delineate the precise host response and management. In the current study, we performed a comprehensive transcriptomics analysis of publicly available seven asymptomatic and eight severe COVID-19 patients. Exploratory data analysis using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed the distinct clusters of asymptomatic and severe patients. Subsequently, the differential gene expression analysis using DESeq2 identified 1,224 significantly upregulated genes (logFC&gt;= 1.5, p-adjusted value &lt;0.05) and 268 significantly downregulated genes (logFC&lt;= -1.5, p-adjusted value &lt;0.05) in severe samples in comparison to asymptomatic samples. Eventually, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of upregulated genes revealed significant enrichment of terms, i.e., anti-viral and anti-inflammatory pathways, secondary infections, Iron homeostasis, anemia, cardiac-related, etc. Gene set enrichment analysis of downregulated genes indicates lipid metabolism, adaptive immune response, translation, recurrent respiratory infections, heme-biosynthetic pathways, etc. In summary, severe COVID-19 patients are more susceptible to other health issues/concerns, non-viral pathogenic infections, atherosclerosis, autoinflammatory diseases, anemia, male infertility, etc. And eventually, these findings provide insight into the precise therapeutic management of severe COVID-19 patients and efficient disease management.","Background COVID-19 is a major worldwide health problem because of acute respiratory distress syndrome, and mortality. Several lines of evidence have suggested a relationship between the vitamin D endocrine system and severity of COVID-19.","Gram-negative bacterium Salmonella Typhimurium (STm) is the causative agent of gastroenteritis. Among the various gut pathogens, STm is still one of the most frequent culprits posing a significant health challenge. STm utilizes its effector proteins to highjack host cell processes. Alteration of SUMOylation, a post-translational modification mechanism, is one such change caused by STm. STm mediated simultaneous downregulation of SUMO-pathway genes, Ubc9 and PIAS1, is required for an efficient infection. In the present study, the regulation of SUMO pathway genes during STm infection was investigated. Promoters of both UBC9 and PIAS1, were seen to harbor binding motifs of AP-1, Activator protein-1 (c-Jun:c-Fos heterodimers or c-Jun:c-Jun homodimers). Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, a direct binding of c-Fos to the identified motifs was observed. Perturbation of c-Fos led to changes in expression of Ubc9 and PIAS1, while its SUMO-modifications resulted in differential regulation of its target genes. In line with this, STm infection of fibroblasts with SUMOylation deficient c-Fos (c-FOS-KOSUMO-def-FOS) resulted in uncontrolled activation of target genes, as revealed by 3\u2019mRNA-Seq analysis and mathematical modelling, resulting in massive activation of inflammatory pathways. Infection of c-FOS-KOSUMO-def-FOS cells favored STm replication, indicating misdirected immune mechanisms in these cells. Finally, chromatin Immuno-precipitation assays confirmed a context dependent differential binding and release of AP-1 to/from target genes due to its Phosphorylation and SUMOylation respectively. Overall, our data point towards existence of a bidirectional cross-talk between c-Fos and the SUMO pathway and highlighting its importance in AP-1 function relevant to STm infections and beyond.","Vitamin D deficiency is a candidate risk factor for a range of adverse health outcomes. In a genome-wide association study of 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentration in 417,580 Europeans we identified 143 independent loci in 112 1-Mb regions providing new insights into the physiology of vitamin D and implicating genes involved in (a) lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, (b) dermal tissue properties, and (c) the sulphonation and glucuronidation of 25OHD. Mendelian randomization models found no robust evidence that 25OHD concentration had causal effects on candidate phenotypes (e.g. BMI, psychiatric disorders), but many phenotypes had (direct or indirect) causal effects on 25OHD concentration, clarifying the relationship between 25OHD status and health.","Anatomically Modern Humans are the sole survivor of a group of hominins that inhabited our planet during the last ice age and that included, among others, Homo neanderthalensis, Homo denisova, and Homo erectus. Whether previous hominin extinctions were triggered by external factors, such as abrupt climate change, volcanic eruptions or whether competition and interbreeding played major roles in their demise still remains unresolved. Here I present a spatially resolved numerical hominin dispersal model (HDM) with empirically constrained key parameters that simulates the migration and interaction of Anatomically Modern Humans and Neanderthals in the rapidly varying climatic environment of the last ice age. The model simulations document that rapid temperature and vegetation changes associated with Dansgaard-Oeschger events were not major drivers of global Neanderthal extinction between 50-35 thousand years ago, but played important roles regionally, in particular over northern Europe. According to a series of parameter sensitivity experiments conducted with the HDM, a realistic extinction of the Neanderthal population can only be simulated when Homo sapiens is chosen to be considerably more effective in exploiting scarce glacial food resources as compared to Neanderthals.","Recent advances in sequencing technology have revolutionised access to large scale genomic data that can be assembled into a platinum quality genome. Here we present a high quality genome assembly with less than 300 gaps of a Brahman cow (B. taurus indicus). The assembly was generated using 195GB of PacBio and 169GB of Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequence data. The high quality genome assembly allows us to identify substantial GC content variation that is positively associated with gene rich islands, and negatively associated with genetic variation in the form of structural variants. In addition, 92371 structural variants that are segregating in the brahman population were identified. Gene ontology analysis revealed that genes with varying copy numbers were enriched for gene ontology terms related to immune function. This analysis has revealed the complex structure of the mammalian genome of an outbred species, and identifies the ability of long read data from diploid species can be used to not only assemble a high quality genome, but also discover novel genetic variation within that genome.","Characterization of ancestry-linked peptide variants in disease-relevant patient tissues represents a foundational step to connect patient ancestry with molecular disease pathogenesis. Nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) encoding missense substitutions within tryptic peptides exhibiting high allele frequencies in European, African, and East Asian populations, termed peptide ancestry informative markers (pAIMs), were prioritized from 1000 genomes. In silico analysis shows that as few as 20 pAIMs can determine ancestry proportions similarly to &gt;260K SNPs (R2=0.9905). Multiplexed proteomic analysis of &gt;100 human endometrial cancer cell lines and uterine leiomyoma tissues resulted in the quantitation of 62 pAIMs that correlate with self-described race and genotype-confirmed patient ancestry. Candidates include a D451E substitution in GC vitamin D-binding protein previously associated with altered vitamin D levels in African and European populations. These efforts describe a generalized set of markers for proteoancestry assessment that will further support studies investigating the impact of ancestry on the human proteome and how this relates to the pathogenesis of uterine neoplasms.","  Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused global disruption and a\nsignificant loss of life. Existing treatments that can be repurposed as\nprophylactic and therapeutic agents could reduce the pandemic's devastation.\nEmerging evidence of potential applications in other therapeutic contexts has\nled to the investigation of dietary supplements and nutraceuticals for\nCOVID-19. Such products include vitamin C, vitamin D, omega 3 polyunsaturated\nfatty acids, probiotics, and zinc, all of which are currently under clinical\ninvestigation. In this review, we critically appraise the evidence surrounding\ndietary supplements and nutraceuticals for the prophylaxis and treatment of\nCOVID-19. Overall, further study is required before evidence-based\nrecommendations can be formulated, but nutritional status plays a significant\nrole in patient outcomes, and these products could help alleviate deficiencies.\nFor example, evidence indicates that vitamin D deficiency may be associated\nwith greater incidence of infection and severity of COVID-19, suggesting that\nvitamin D supplementation may hold prophylactic or therapeutic value. A growing\nnumber of scientific organizations are now considering recommending vitamin D\nsupplementation to those at high risk of COVID-19. Because research in vitamin\nD and other nutraceuticals and supplements is preliminary, here we evaluate the\nextent to which these nutraceutical and dietary supplements hold potential in\nthe COVID-19 crisis.\n","The recent COVID-19 pandemic has sparked a global public health crisis. Vital to the development of informed treatments for this disease is a comprehensive understanding of the molecular interactions involved in disease pathology. One lens through which we can better understand this pathology is through the network of protein-protein interactions between its viral agent, SARS-CoV-2, and its human host. For instance, increased infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV can be explained by rapid evolution along the interface between the Spike protein and its human receptor (ACE2) leading to increased binding affinity. Sequence divergences that modulate other protein-protein interactions may further explain differences in transmission and virulence in this novel coronavirus. To facilitate these comparisons, we combined homology-based structural modeling with the ECLAIR pipeline for interface prediction at residue resolution, and molecular docking with PyRosetta. This enabled us to compile a novel 3D structural interactome meta-analysis for the published interactome network between SARS-CoV-2 and human. This resource includes docked structures for all interactions with protein structures, enrichment analysis of variation along interfaces, predicted \u0394\u0394G between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 variants for each interaction, predicted impact of natural human population variation on binding affinity, and a further prioritized set of drug repurposing candidates predicted to overlap with protein interfaces\u2020. All predictions are available online\u2020 for easy access and are continually updated when new interactions are published.","Vitamin D has been associated with a variety of human complex traits and diseases in observational studies, but a causal relationship remains unclear. To examine a putative causal effect of vitamin D across phenotypic domains and disease categories, we conducted Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses using genetic instruments associated with circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations. We leveraged genome-wide significant 25(OH)D-associated SNPs (N=138) from a meta-analysis combining a vitamin D GWAS conducted in 401,460 white British UK Biobank (UKBB) participants and an independent vitamin D GWAS including 42,274 samples of European ancestry, and examined 190 large-scale health-related GWAS spanning a broad spectrum of complex traits, diseases and biomarkers. We applied multiple MR methods to estimate the causal effect of vitamin D while testing and controlling for potential biases from horizontal pleiotropy. Consistent with previous findings, genetically predicted increased 25(OH)D levels significantly decreased the risk of multiple sclerosis (OR=0.824; 95%CI=0.689-0.986). The protective effect estimate was consistent across different MR methods and four different multiple sclerosis GWAS with varying sample sizes and genotyping platforms. On the contrary, we found limited evidence in support of a causal effect of 25(OH)D on anthropometric traits, obesity, cognitive function, sleep behavior, breast and prostate cancer, and autoimmune, cardiovascular, metabolic, neurological and psychiatric traits and diseases, and blood biomarkers. Our results may inform ongoing and future randomized clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation.","Background The mechanisms linking UV radiation and vitamin D exposure to the risk of acquiring the latitude and critical period dependent autoimmune disease, multiple sclerosis, is unclear. We examined the effect of vitamin D on DNA methylation as well as DNA methylation at vitamin D receptor binding sites in adult and paediatric myeloid cells.","Individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus experience high rates of influenza virus infection and complications. We compared the magnitude and duration of serologic response to trivalent influenza vaccine in adults aged 50-80 with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus. Serologic response to influenza vaccination was similar in both groups: greater fold-increases in antibody titer occurred among individuals with lower pre-vaccination antibody titers. Waning of antibody titers was not influenced by diabetes status.","Background The amount of published in vivo studies and the speed researchers are publishing them make it virtually impossible to follow the recent development in the field. Systematic review emerged as a method to summarise and analyse the studies quantitatively and critically but it is often out-of-date due to its lengthy process.","The gut microbiome is strongly interwoven with human health. Conventional gut microbiome analysis generally involves 16S rRNA gene targeting next generation sequencing (NGS) of stool microbial communities, and correlation of results with clinical parameters. However, some microorganisms may not be alive at the time of sampling, and thus their impact on the human health is potentially less significant. As conventional NGS methods do not differentiate between viable and dead microbial components, retrieved results provide only limited information.","Here we present an exome-wide rare genetic variant association study for 30 blood biomarkers in 191,971 individuals in the UK Biobank. We compare gene-based association tests for separate functional variant categories to increase interpretability and identify 193 significant gene-biomarker associations. Genes associated with biomarkers were ~ 4.5-fold enriched for conferring Mendelian disorders. In addition to performing weighted gene-based variant collapsing tests, we design and apply variant-category-specific kernel-based tests that integrate quantitative functional variant effect predictions for missense variants, splicing and the binding of RNA-binding proteins. For these tests, we present a statistically powerful and computationally efficient combination of the likelihood-ratio and score tests that found 36% more associations than the score test alone. Kernel-based tests identified 13% more associations than their gene-based collapsing counterparts and had advantages in the presence of gain of function missense variants. We introduce local collapsing by amino acid position for missense variants and use it to interpret associations and identify potential novel gain of function variants in PIEZO1. Our results show the benefits of investigating different functional mechanisms when performing rare-variant association tests, and demonstrate pervasive rare-variant contribution to biomarker variability.","We exploited genetic information to assess non-genetic influences in autoimmunity. We isolated gene modules whose products physically interact with environmental exposures related to autoimmunity, and analyzed their nominal statistical evidence of association with autoimmune and non-autoimmune diseases in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data. Epstein Barr virus (EBV) and other Herpesviruses interactomes emerged as specifically associated with multiple sclerosis (MS), possibly under common regulatory mechanisms. Analyses of MS blood and brain transcriptomes, cytofluorimetric studies of endogenous EBV-infected lymphoblastoid lines, and lesion immunohistochemistry, confirmed a dysregulation of MS-associated EBV interactors, suggesting their contribution to CD40 signaling alterations in MS. These interactors resulted enriched in modules from inherited axonopathies-causing genes, supporting a link between EBV and neurodegeneration in MS, in accord with the observed transcriptomic dysregulations in MS brains. They were also enriched with top-ranked pharmaceutical targets prioritized on a genetic basis. This study delineates a disease-specific influence of herpesviruses on MS biology.","Background Multiple sclerosis (MS) disease risk is associated with reduced sun exposure. This study assessed the relationship between measures of sun-exposure (vitamin D (vitD), latitude) and MS disease severity, the mechanisms of action, and effect-modification by medication and sun-sensitivity associated MC1R variants.","Introduction/Aims The ability of low intensity vibration (LIV) to combat skeletal decline in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) was evaluated in a randomized controlled trial.","Context Vitamin D inadequacy, assessed by 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], affects around 50% of adults in the United States and is associated with numerous adverse health outcomes. Blood 25(OH)D concentrations are influenced by genetic factors that may determine how much vitamin D intake is required to reach optimal 25(OH)D. Despite large genome-wide association studies (GWASs), only a small portion of the genetic factors contributing to differences in 25(OH)D levels has been discovered.","As a direct result of intense heat and aridity, deserts are thought to be among the most harsh of environments, particularly for their mammalian inhabitants. Given that osmoregulation can be challenging for these animals, with failure resulting in death, strong selection should be observed on genes related to the maintenance of water and solute balance. One such animal, Peromyscus eremicus, is native to the desert regions of the southwest United States and may live its entire life without oral fluid intake. As a first step toward understanding the genetics that underlie this phenotype, we present a characterization of the P. eremicus transcriptome. We assay four tissues (kidney, liver, brain, testes) from a single individual and supplement this with population level renal transcriptome sequencing from 15 additional animals. We identified a set of transcripts undergoing both purifying and balancing selection based on estimates of Tajima\u2019s D. In addition, we used the branch-site test to identify a transcript \u2013 Slc2a9, likely related to desert osmoregulation \u2013 undergoing enhanced selection in P. eremicus relative to a set of related non-desert rodents.","In this paper, I used multivariate linear regression analysis to determine if latitude and ozone concentration predict Covid-2019 cases in 34 countries worldwide. Data pertaining to Covid-2019 cases were extracted from Worldometer. Ozone concentration levels were taken from the open-access database of World Ozone and Ultraviolet Radiation Data Centre (WOUDC). Latitude of specific area where measurement took place was also provided in the database. Preliminary Kendall rank correlation test revealed that Covid-2019 incidence was positively and significantly related to ozone concentration; however, incidence was not significantly related to latitude. Using multivariate linear regression, a statistically significant link between ozone concentration and Covid-2019 incidence in 34 countries was established; however, I found no statistical association between latitude and Covid-2019 incidence refuting previous claims. Prompt health actions should be developed for areas with high ozone concentration in the present and possibly, future outbreaks; however, extensive laboratory analysis should be conducted to further confirm the findings of the study. Nevertheless, the results of this study could serve as a basis for further clinical and large-scale studies.","Objective Vitamin D status has been linked to risk of inflammatory brain lesions. We sought to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of oral vitamin D dosing regimens in boys with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD).","Background The COVID-19 pandemic goes along with increased mortality from acute respiratory disease, and measures to limit the spread of the infection go along with increased risk of vitamin D deficiency, especially among high risk groups. It has been suggested that vitamin D3 supplementation might help to reduce respiratory disease mortality.","Purpose The Westlake BioBank for Chinese (WBBC) pilot cohort is a population-based prospective study with its major purpose to better understand the effect of genetic and environmental factors on growth and development from adolescents to adults. The dataset comprises a wide range of demographics, anthropometric measures, physical activity, sleep quality, age at menarche and bone mineral density.","Proximal genetic variants are frequently correlated, implying that also the corresponding effect sizes detected by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are not independent. There are already methods taking this into account when aggregating effects from a single GWAS across genes or pathways. Here we present a rigorous, yet fast method for detecting genes with coherent association signals for two traits, facilitating cross-GWAS analyses. To this end we devised a new significance test for covariance of datapoints not drawn independently, but with known inter-sample covariance structure. We show that the distribution of its test statistic is a linear combination of \u03c72 distributions, with positive and negative coefficients. The corresponding cumulative distribution function can be efficiently calculated with Davies\u2019 algorithm at high precision. We apply this general framework to test for dependence between SNP-wise effect sizes of two GWAS at the level of genes. We extend this test to detect also gene-wise causal links. We demonstrate the utility of our method by uncovering potential shared genetic links between severity of COVID-19 and (1) being prescribed class M05B medication (drugs affecting bone structure and mineralization), (2) rheumatoid arthritis, (3) vitamin D (25OHD), and (4) serum calcium concentrations. Our method detects a potential role played by chemokine receptor genes linked to TH1 versus TH2 immune reaction, a gene related to integrin beta-1 cell surface expression, and other genes potentially impacting severity of COVID-19. Our approach will be useful for similar analyses involving data-points with known auto-correlation structures.","Background SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing the Covid-19 pandemic emerged in December 2019 in China and raised fears that it could overwhelm healthcare systems worldwide. In June 2020, all African countries registered human infections with SARS-CoV-2.","Human gut microbiome composition is shaped by multiple host intrinsic and extrinsic factors, but the relative contribution of host genetic compared to environmental factors remains elusive. Here, we genotyped a cohort of 696 healthy individuals from several distinct ancestral origins and a relatively common environment, and demonstrate that there is no statistically significant association between microbiome composition and ethnicity, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), or overall genetic similarity, and that only 5 of 211 (2.4%) previously reported microbiome-SNP associations replicate in our cohort. In contrast, we find similarities in the microbiome composition of genetically unrelated individuals who share a household. We define the term biome-explainability as the variance of a host phenotype explained by the microbiome after accounting for the contribution of human genetics. Consistent with our finding that microbiome and host genetics are largely independent, we find significant biome-explainability levels of 16-33% for body mass index (BMI), fasting glucose, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, waist circumference, waist-hip ratio (WHR), and lactose consumption. We further show that several human phenotypes can be predicted substantially more accurately when adding microbiome data to host genetics data, and that the contribution of both data sources to prediction accuracy is largely additive. Overall, our results suggest that human microbiome composition is dominated by environmental factors rather than by host genetics.","Vitamin D deficiency is an endemic problem existing worldwide. Although several strategies were established to enhance vitamin D3 levels, studies specifically focussing inhibition of vitamin D metabolism which may prolong the availability of active vitamin D in pathological conditions are less explored. Studies also suggest that higher doses of vitamin D3 fail to achieve optimum vitamin D levels. In this context, we focussed on the enzyme CYP3A4 which promotes inactivation of active vitamin D. The current study was aimed to decipher the impact of chrysin, a proven CYP3A4 inhibitor as an intervention and its effects in combination with low dose vitamin D3 (40 IU) and bone health in vitamin D deficiency condition. The in-vivo activity of chrysin was evaluated on female Wistar albino rats fed with a vitamin D deficient diet to attain vitamin D deficiency for 28 days. Chrysin was given alone and in combination with calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and/or vitamin D3. All the therapeutic interventions were assessed for serum 25-OH-D3 by LC-MS, biochemical, urinary, and bone parameters. Animals treated with chrysin alone and in combination with low dose vitamin D3 and/or CaCO3 showed an eminent rise in serum 25-OH-D3 levels along with increased serum biochemical parameters. On contrary, a significant decrease in the urinary parameters followed by beneficial effects on bone parameters was noticed in contrast with the vitamin D deficient diet group. Our findings revealed that although chrysin alone showed a notable effect on 25-OH-D3 and osseous tissue, comparatively it showed intensified therapeutic effect in combination with vitamin D3 and CaCO3 which can be employed as a cost-effective option to improve bone health.","SARS-CoV-2 causes remarkably variable disease from asymptomatic individuals to respiratory insufficiency and coagulopathy. Vitamin K deficiency was recently found to associate with clinical outcome in a cohort of COVID-19 patients. Vitamin D has been hypothesized to reduce disease susceptibility by modulating inflammation, yet little is known about its role in disease severity. Considering the critical interaction between vitamin K and vitamin D in calcium and elastic fiber metabolism, we determined vitamin D status in the same cohort of 135 hospitalized COVID-19 patients by measuring blood 25(OH)D levels. We found no difference in vitamin D status between those with good and poor outcome (defined as intubation and/or death). Instead, we found vitamin D sufficient persons (25(OH)D &gt;50 nmol/L) had accelerated elastic fiber degradation compared to those with mild deficiency (25(OH)D 25-50 nmol/L). Based on these findings, we hypothesize that vitamin D might have both favorable anti-inflammatory and unfavorable pro-calcification effects during COVID-19 and that vitamin K might compensate for the latter.","Background Vitamin D is a fundamental regulator of host defences by activating genes related to innate and adaptive immunity. Previous research shows a correlation between the levels of vitamin D in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the degree of disease severity. This work investigates the impact of the genetic background related to vitamin D pathways on COVID-19 severity. For the first time, the Portuguese population was characterized regarding the prevalence of high impact variants in genes associated with the vitamin D pathways.","Psoriasis is an inflammatory skin disease with strong immune cell infiltration and high levels of the antimicrobial peptide, LL37. LL37 was shown to complex DNA and RNA to activate plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) in vitro and this has been thought to drive interferon-mediated disease exacerbation. However, the physiological source of such nucleic acids and thus an early initiating event for nucleic-acid mediated inflammation remains unknown. We hypothesized that neutrophils (PMNs), which dominate the psoriatic skin infiltrate, may be the source of DNA and LL37 as well-established components of so-called neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). We show here that indeed primary murine and human PMNs mount a fulminant NET and cytokine response, albeit not via DNA-but rather RNA-LL37 complexes. This was dependent on TLR8/TLR13 and sensitive to TLR inhibitory oligodeoxynucleotides. Unexpectedly, copious amounts of RNA were identified as a so far unappreciated NET component in vitro and in psoriatic but not healthy skin. Importantly, RNA-LL37-triggered NETs, when transferred to na\u00efve PMNs, prompted additional de novo NET release. Our study highlights TLR-mediated RNA-LL37 sensing by PMNs as parts of a self-propagating vicious cycle that may later engulf pDC and establish chronic inflammation in psoriasis and NET-associated RNA (naRNA) as a physiologically relevant novel component.","Vitamin D and its biomarker 25(OH)D are known to vary by race/ethnicity with African Americans (AAs) having significantly lower levels than non-Hispanic whites (white Americans). However, AAs have better bone mineral density (BMD) and less arterial calcification, one marker of cardiovascular risk, than white Americans, with some studies showing higher vit. D levels harmful to AAs. This study analyzes NHANES data from 2011 to 2014, NHANES being a biennially published national survey of nearly 10,000 people, with interview, examination, and lab data components. The analyses, using count regression and linear regression models to avoid thresholding of variables, find that abdominal aortic calcification scores rise with 24(OH)D in white Americans, with no statistically significant effect in AAs; femoral BMD falls with 25(OH)D in both groups; osteoporotic fracture risks fall with 25(OH)D in white Americans; and periodontal attachment loss falls with rising 25(OH)D in both groups. Overall, higher 25(OH)D seems protective for oral and skeletal health in white Americans, protective for periodontal health in AAs, negative for their skeletal health, and negative for arterial calcification in white Americans, after controlling for the demographic factors of age and sex, the physiological elements of blood pressure and BMI, the biochemical variables of LDL and cholesterol levels, the socioeconomic indicators of income-to-poverty-level ratio and education levels, and the environmental influence of the season. As periodontitis is low on the disease hazard scale compared to arterial calcification and skeletal health, the results point to a lack of significant protection with rising OH(D) levels in AAs, even after their low base levels, and some harmful impact from those higher levels. That combination should trigger a closer look at the single population-wide vitamin D threshold of 30 to 50 ng/mL currently recommended in the US.","Individuals with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have poor ability to adapt to diet-triggered perturbations. We investigated global metabolic responses to a mixed meal test (MMT) in morbidly obese individuals with different diabetic status by performing plasma metabolomic profiling. Abnormal metabolism of carbohydrates, (branched-chain) amino acids, fatty acids and acylcholines in individuals with (pre)diabetes was observed. Moreover, differences in metabolic responses were associated with altered fecal metagenomics and transcriptomes of liver, jejunum and adipose tissues, which revealed a modified gut microbiome and multi-tissue metabolism in individuals having insulin resistance. Finally, using integrative machine learning models, we built a predictive model based on metabolomics data after 2h MMT, and identified possible new biomarkers for glycemic control including N\u2212acetylaspartate and phenylalanine-derived metabolites that may be useful for diagnosis, intervention and prevention of T2DM.","Objectives Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly around the world, and many risk factors including patient demographics, social determinants of health, environmental variables, underlying health conditions, and adherence to social distancing have been hypothesized to affect case and death rates. However, little has been done to account for the potential confounding effects of these factors. Using a large multivariate analysis, this study illuminates modulators of COVID-19 incidence and mortality in U.S. counties while controlling for risk factors across multiple domains.","Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) represents an analytical technique with significant practical societal impact. Spectral deconvolution is an essential step for interpreting GC-MS data. No public GC-MS repositories that also enable repository-scale analysis exist, in part because deconvolution requires significant user input. We therefore engineered a scalable machine learning workflow for the Global Natural Product Social Molecular Networking (GNPS) analysis platform to enable the mass spectrometry community to store, process, share, annotate, compare, and perform molecular networking of GC-MS data. The workflow performs auto-deconvolution of compound fragmentation patterns via unsupervised non-negative matrix factorization, using a Fast Fourier Transform-based strategy to overcome scalability limitations. We introduce a \u201cbalance score\u201d that quantifies the reproducibility of fragmentation patterns across all samples. We demonstrate the utility of the platform with breathomics analysis applied to the early detection of oesophago-gastric cancer, and by creating the first molecular spatial map of the human volatilome.","OBJECTIVE To explore the nature of MS-susceptibility and, by extension, other complex-genetic diseases.","Intravenous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) is used in equine practice to treat hypomagnesemia, dysrhythmias, neurological disorders, and calcium dysregulation. MgSO4 is also used as a calming agent in equestrian events. Hypercalcemia affects calcium-regulating hormones, as well as plasma and urinary electrolytes; however, the effect of hypermagnesemia on these variables is unknown. The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of hypermagnesemia on blood parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcitonin (CT), ionized calcium (Ca2+), ionized magnesium (Mg2+), sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), chloride (Cl-) and their urinary fractional excretion (F) after intravenous administration of MgSO4 in healthy horses. Twelve healthy female horses of 4-18 years of age and 432-600 kg of body weight received a single intravenous dose of MgSO4 (60 mg/kg) over 5 minutes, and blood and urine samples were collected at different time points over 360 minutes. Plasma Mg2+ concentrations increased 3.7-fold over baseline values at 5 minutes and remained elevated for 120 minutes (P &lt; 0.05), Ca2+ concentrations decreased from 30-60 minutes (P &lt; 0.05), but Na+, K+ and Cl- concentrations did not change. Serum PTH concentrations dropped initially to rebound and remain elevated from 30 to 60 minutes, while CT concentrations increased at 5 minutes to return to baseline by 10 minutes (P &lt; 0.05). The FMg, FCa, FNa, FK, and FCl increased, while urine osmolality decreased from 30-60 minutes compared baseline (P &lt; 0.05). Experimental hypermagnesemia alters calcium-regulating hormones (PTH, CT), reduces plasma Ca2+ concentrations, and increases the urinary excretion of Mg2+, Ca2+, K+, Na+ and Cl- in healthy horses. This information has clinical implications on the short-term effects of hypermagnesemia on calcium-regulating hormones as well as plasma and urine electrolytes.","Human lifestyle and physiological variables on human disease risk have been revealed to be mediated by gut microbiota. Low concordance between many case-control studies for detecting disease-associated microbe existed and it is likely due to the limited sample size and the population-wide bias in human lifestyle and physiological variables. To infer association between whole gut microbiota and diseases accurately, we propose to build machine learning models by including both human variables and gut microbiota based on the American Gut Project data, the largest known publicly available human gut bacterial microbiota dataset. When the model's performance with both gut microbiota and human variables is better than the model with just human variables, the independent association of gut microbiota with the disease will be confirmed. We found that gut microbes showed different association strengths with different diseases. Adding gut microbiota into human variables enhanced the association strengths with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and unhealthy status; showed no effect on association strengths with Diabetes and IBS; reduced the association strengths with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, C. difficile infection, lactose intolerance, cardiovascular disease and mental disorders. Our results suggested that although gut microbiota was reported to be associated with many diseases, a considerable proportion of these associations may be spurious. We also proposed a list of microbes as biomarkers to classify IBD and unhealthy status, and validated them by reference to previously published research.","Background and aims Human colonoid cultures maintained under low-calcium (0.25 mM) conditions undergo differentiation spontaneously and, concomitantly, express a high level of tight junction proteins, but not desmosomal proteins. When calcium is included to a final concentration of 1.5 \u2013 3.0 mM (provided either as a single agent or as a combination of calcium and minerals), there is little change in tight junction proteins but a strong up-regulation of desmosomal proteins and an increase in desmosome formation. The aim of this study was to assess functional consequences of the differences in calcium-mediated barrier protein expression.","Daphnia, an important model system for the study of evolution, development, phenotypic plasticity, and environmental health, lacks a modern reference atlas for microanatomy. To facilitate the comprehensive assessment of phenotypic effects of genes and environment, we created the Daphnia histology reference atlas (http://daphnia.io/anatomy/), a tractable, interactive web-based tool that provides insight into normal phenotype through vectorized annotations overlaid onto digital histology sections imaged at 40X magnification. Guided by our expert-curated and multimodal informed hierarchical anatomical ontology, we show that this resource can be used to elucidate sex-specific differences between female and male Daphnia magna in each of 3 orthogonal planes, providing new insight for the study of sex-specific traits. This atlas is a new, open-source resource for the Daphnia community to facilitate education and research collaboration, and as a precursor for the 3D atlas. It is also our intention that this atlas aids in phenotypic anchoring of large-scale biomolecular (multi-omics) data from comparative toxicological studies. Greater access to high-quality histological data may clarify cross-correlations between microanatomic and multi-omic phenotypes caused by genetic variation, environment, and disease across phylogeny.","Background Transcriptome profiling approaches have been widely used in the investigation of mechanisms underlying psoriasis pathogenesis. In most instances, changes in transcript abundance have been measured in skin biopsies. Fewer studies have examined changes in the blood samples from patients with psoriasis. While changes in the periphery may be less relevant, the blood cell transcriptome analysis presents the distinct advantage of being amenable to comparison across diseases.","Objective MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are promising tools as biomarkers and therapeutic agents in various chronic diseases such as osteoporosis, cancers, type I and II diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Considering the rising interest in the regulatory role of miRNAs in bone metabolism, aging, and cellular senescence, accurate normalization of qPCR-based miRNA expression data using an optimal endogenous control becomes crucial.","Increasing evidence indicate that obesity is highly associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD).GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist has shown benefits on kidney diseases, but its direct role on kidney metabolism in obesity is still not clear. This study aims to investigate the protection and metabolic modulation role of liraglutide (Lira) on kidney of obesity. Rats were induced obese by high-fat diet (HFD), and renal function and metabolism changes were evaluated by metabolomic, biological and histological methods. HFD rats exhibited metabolic disorders including elevated body weight, hyperlipidemia and impaired glucose tolerance, and remarkable renal injuries including declined renal function and inflammatory/fibrotic changes, whereas Lira significantly ameliorated these adverse effects in HFD rats. Metabolomic data showed that Lira reduced renal lipids including fatty acid residues, cholesterol, phospholipids and triglycerides, and improved mitochondria metabolites such as succinate, citrate, taurine, fumarate and NAD+ in the kidney of HDF rats. Furthermore, we revealed that Lira inhibited renal lipid accumulation by coordinating lipogenic and lipolytic signals, and rescued renal mitochondria function via Sirt1/AMPK/PGC1\u03b1 pathways in HDF rats. This study suggested that Lira alleviated HFD-induced kidney injury via directly restoring renal lipid and energy metabolism, and GLP-1 receptor agonist is a promising therapy for obesity-associated CKD.","Hypercholesterolemia has posed a serious threat of heart diseases and stroke worldwide. Xanthine oxidase (XO), the rate-limiting enzyme in uric acid biosynthesis, is regarded as the root of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that generates atherosclerosis and cholesterol crystals. \u03b2-Hydroxy \u03b2-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGR) is a rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. Although some commercially available enzyme inhibiting drugs have effectively reduced the cholesterol level, most of them have failed to meet the requirements of being apt drug candidates. Here, we have carried out an in-silico analysis of secondary metabolites that have already shown good inhibitory activity against XO and HMGR. Out of 118 secondary metabolites reviewed, sixteen molecules inhibiting XO and HMGR were taken based on IC50 values reported in vitro assays. Further, receptor-based virtual screening was carried out against secondary metabolites using GOLD Protein-Ligand Docking Software, combined with subsequent post-docking, to study the binding affinities of ligands to the enzymes. In-Silico ADMET analysis was carried out to study their pharmacokinetic properties, followed by toxicity prediction through ProTox-II. The molecular docking of amentoflavone (1) (GOLD score 70.54), and ganomycin I (9) (GOLD score 59.61) evinced that the drug has effectively bind at the competitive site of XO and HMGR, respectively. Besides, 6-paradol (3) and selgin (4) could be potential drug candidates to inhibit XO. Likewise, n-octadecanyl-O-\u03b1-D-glucopyranosyl(6\u2019\u21921\u201d)-O-\u03b1-D-glucopyranoside (10) could be potential drug candidates to maintain serum cholesterol. In-silico ADMET analysis showed that the sixteen metabolites were optimal within the categorical range in comparison to commercially available XO and HMGR inhibitors, respectively. Toxicity analysis through Protox-II revealed that 6-gingerol (2), ganoleucoin K (11), and ganoleucoin Z (12) are toxic for human use. This computational analysis supports earlier experimental evidence towards the inhibition of XO and HMGR by natural products. Further study is necessary to explore the clinical efficacy of these secondary molecules, which might be alternatives for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia.","While studying aspects of the sperm biology and immunity of two species of crickets, we encountered bacteria that were released from the male sperm container, the spermatophore, alongside sperm. We describe a presumably rich microbe flora in the sperm population (\u2018sperm-associated microbiota\u2019). These sperm-associated microbiota differed between the two species of cricket and between different populations and showed functional diversity. Further, sperm-associated microbiota killed sperm, highlighting their potential role in fitness, especially since they are most likely transferred to females during mating.","Testicular microcalcifications consist of hydroxyapatite and their demonstration by ultrasound has been associated with increased risk of testicular germ cell cancer (TGCT). Here, we show that fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a bone-specific regulator of phosphate homeostasis, is expressed in testicular germ cell neoplasia in situ (GCNIS), embryonal carcinoma (EC), and human embryonic stem cells. FGF23 is not glycosylated in TGCTs and thus rapidly cleaved into a C-terminal fragment that serves as a competitive antagonist for full-length FGF23. High levels of C-terminal FGF23 occupy the receptor formed by Klotho and FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1) in the germ cells facilitating a shift in the expression of phosphate transport proteins from SLC34A2 to SLC34A1 in seminiferous tubules adjacent to GCNIS. Fgf23 knockout mice have a marked epididymal deposition of hydroxyapatite, while the testicular phenotype is milder with spermatogenic arrest and focal germ-cell-specific expression of the bone-like markers runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) and bone gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-containing protein (BGLAP). In accordance, mice with no functional androgen receptor and lack of circulating gonadotropins develop microcalcifications in 94% of cases and have lower Slc34a2, and higher Slc34a1 and Bglap expression. In accordance, human testicular specimens with microcalcifications also have lower SLC34A2, and focally germ cells express SLC34A1, BGLAP, and RUNX2. Importantly, calcium or phosphate induced osteogenic transdifferentiation of a spermatogonial cell line in vitro demonstrated by induction of alkaline phosphatase activity and deposition of hydroxyapatite, which could be fully rescued by pyrophosphate (PPi). Severe microcalcifications were also found in a mouse model with Sertoli-cell ablation particularly when Sertoli-ablation was conducted prepubertally where the germ cells retain stem cell potential. In conclusion, cancer-related microcalcifications may arise secondary to gonadal mineral alterations, which in combination with impaired Sertoli cell function and reduced PPi due to high alkaline phosphatase activity in GCNIS and TGCTs, facilitates osteogenic transdifferentiation of testicular germ cells and deposition of hydroxyapatite.","Loss-of-function mutations in ALPL result in hypophosphatasia (HPP), an inborn error of metabolism that causes skeletal mineralization defect. In adults, main clinical involvement includes early loss of primary or secondary teeth, osteoporosis, bone pain, chondrocalcinosis, and fractures. However, guidelines for the treatment of adults with HPP are not available. Here, we show that ALPL deficiency caused reduction of intracellular Ca2+ influx resulting in osteoporotic phenotype due to downregulated osteogenic differentiation and upregulated adipogenic differentiation in both human and mouse BMSCs. To elevate intracellular level of calcium in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) by ionomycin treatment rescues the osteoporotic phenotype in alpl+/- mice and BMSC-specific (Prrx1-alpl-/-) conditional alpl knockout mice. Mechanistically, ALPL is required to maintain intracellular Ca2+ influx by regulating L-type Ca2+ channel trafficking via binding to the \u03b12\u03b4 subunits, which regulates the internalization of L-type Ca2+ channel. Decreased Ca2+ flux inactivates Akt/GSK3\u03b2/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway that regulates lineage differentiation of BMSCs. This study identifies a previous unknown role of ectoenzyme ALPL in maintenance of calcium channel trafficking to keep stem cell lineage differentiation and bone homeostasis. Accelerating Ca2+ flux through L-type Ca2+ channel by ionomycin treatment may be a promising therapeutic approach for adult HPP patients.","Objective Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the pathogen accountable for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Viral entry via binding of the receptor binding domain (RBD) located within the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein to its target receptor angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is a key step in cell infection. The efficient transition of the virus is linked to a unique protein called open reading frame (ORF) 8. As SARS-CoV-2 infections can develop into life-threatening lower respiratory syndromes, effective therapy options are urgently needed. Several publications propose vitamin D treatment, although its mode of action against COVID-19 is not fully elucidated. It is speculated that vitamin D\u2019s beneficial effects are mediated by up-regulating LL-37, a well-known antimicrobial peptide with antiviral effects.","Objectives We examined the influence of the ex vivo combination therapy of metformin (Met, 1,1-dimethylbiguanide hydrochloride) with sodium selenite (Ss, Na2SeO3) on the changes in the production of nitric oxide (NO) and selected cytokines by circulating monocytes (MOs) during T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL).","Host-derived antimicrobial peptides play an important role in the defense against extracellular bacterial infections. However, the capacity of antimicrobial peptides derived from macrophages as potential antibacterial effectors against intracellular pathogens remains unknown. In this study, we report that normal (wild type, WT) mouse macrophages increased their expression of the cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide (CRAMP) after infection by viable E. coli or stimulation with inactivated E. coli and its product LPS, a process involving activation of NF-\u03baB followed by protease-dependent conversion of CRAMP from an inactive precursor to an active form. The active CRAMP was required by WT macrophages to eliminate phagocytosed E. coli, with participation of autophagy-related proteins ATG5, LC3-II, and LAMP-1 as well as conjugation of the bacteria with p62. The autophagy-mediated elimination of E. coli was impaired in CRAMP\u2212/\u2212 macrophages resulting in retention of intracellular bacteria and fragmentation of macrophages. These results indicate CRAMP as a critical component in autophagy-mediated clearance of intracellular E. coli by macrophages.","Vitamin D is an essential steroid hormone that regulates systemic calcium homeostasis and cell fate decisions, including differentiation in many cell types. The prostate gland is hormonally regulated, requiring steroids for proliferation and terminal differentiation of secretory luminal cells. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with higher risk of lethal prostate cancer with an aggressive dedifferentiated pathology, linking vitamin D sufficiency to epithelial differentiation homeostasis. To determine regulation of prostate epithelial differentiation by vitamin D status, patient-derived benign prostate epithelial organoids were maintained in vitamin D deficient (vehicle) or sufficient (10 nM 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D) conditions and assessed by phenotype and single cell RNA sequencing. Mechanistic validation demonstrated that vitamin D sufficiency promoted organoid growth and accelerated differentiation of lineage-committed cells by inhibiting canonical Wnt activity and Wnt family member DKK3. Wnt dysregulation is a known contributor to aggressive prostate cancer, thus these findings further link vitamin D deficiency to lethal disease.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral illness caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and is a worsening global pandemic. COVID-19 has caused at least 1.7 million deaths worldwide and over 300,000 in the United States. Recently, two promising vaccines are being administered in several countries. However, there remains an urgent need for a therapeutic treatment for COVID-19 patients with severe respiratory damage that can lead to intensive care, prolonged hospitalization, or mortality. Moreover, an increasing population of patients manifest lingering disabling symptoms (called Long Haulers). Here, we tested the efficacy of a recombinant neural epidermal growth factor like 1 protein variant (NELL1-NV1) in a COVID-19 mouse model, transgenic mice expressing the human angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor (tg-mice hACE2) infected with SARS-CoV-2. The administration of NELL1-NV1 to SARS-CoV-2-infected tg-mice hACE2 significantly improved clinical health score and increased survival. Analyses of bronchoalveolar (BAL) fluid demonstrated decreased levels of several cytokines and chemokines (IFN-\u03b3, IL-10, IL-12 p70, CXCL-10/IP-10, MIG and Rantes), in NV1-treated treated mice compared to controls. Cytokines including IL-1\u03b1, IL-9, IL-6, LIX/CXCL5, KC/CXCL1, MIP-2/CXCL2, MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3, and G-CSF, critical to immune responses such as neutrophil recruitment, viral clearance and vascularization, were increased compared to controls. Our data suggest the potential of NELL1-NV1-based therapy to mitigate the cytokine storm, modulate the abnormal immune response and repair respiratory tissue damage in COVID-19 patients.","TElevated production of collagen-rich extracellular matrix (ECM) is a hallmark of cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and a central driver of cancer aggressiveness. How to target ECM production to oppose cancer is yet unclear, since targeting CAFs has been shown to restrain but also promote cancer progression. Metabolic rewiring is a hallmark of CAFs. Here we find that proline, which is a highly abundant amino acid in collagen proteins, is newly synthesised from glutamine to make tumour collagen in breast cancer xenografts, and that its production is elevated in breast cancer CAFs. PYCR1 is the rate-limiting enzyme for proline synthesis and is highly expressed in the tumour stroma of breast cancer patients and in CAFs. Reducing PYCR1 levels in CAFs is sufficient to reduce tumour collagen production, tumour growth and metastatic spread in vivo and cancer cell proliferation in vitro. PYCR1 and COL1A1 are overexpressed in patients with invasive ductal carcinoma with poor prognosis. Both collagen and glutamine-derived proline synthesis in CAFs are enhanced by increased pyruvate dehydrogenase-derived acetyl-CoA levels, via gene expression regulation through the epigenetic regulator histone acetyl transferase EP300. Altogether, our work unveils unprecedented roles of CAF metabolism to support pro-tumorigenic collagen production. PYCR1 is a recognised cancer cell vulnerability and potential target for therapy, hence, our work provides evidence that targeting PYCR1 in tumours may have the additional benefit of halting the production of pro-tumorigenic ECM.","Successful control of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection by macrophages relies on immunometabolic reprogramming, where the role of fatty acids (FAs) remains poorly understood. Recent studies unraveled Mtb\u2019s capacity to acquire saturated and monounsaturated FAs via the Mce1 importer. However, upon activation macrophages produce polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs), mammal-specific FAs mediating the generation of key immunomodulatory eicosanoids. Here, we asked whether de novo synthesis of PUFAs is modulated in Mtb-infected macrophages and benefits host or pathogen. Quantitative lipidomics revealed that Mtb infection activates the early PUFA biosynthetic pathway for production of eicosanoids. While PUFA synthesis blockade significantly impaired the inflammatory and antimicrobial responses of infected macrophages, it had no effect on Mtb growth in vivo. Using a click-chemistry approach, we found that Mtb efficiently imports PUFAs of the \u03c96 subset via Mce1 in axenic culture, including the eicosanoid precursor arachidonic acid (AA). Notably, Mtb preferentially internalized AA over all other FAs within infected macrophages, but here Mtb\u2019s import of AA was largely Mce1-independent and correlated with elevated AA uptake by host cells. Together, these findings reveal AA as a major FA substrate for intracellular Mtb. They suggest that Mtb\u2019s hijacking of host-derived AA may counteract its stimulatory effect on anti-mycobacterial immune responses.","Numerous aspects of cellular signaling are regulated by the kinome \u2013 the network of over 500 protein kinases that guides and modulates information transfer throughout the cell. The key role played by both individual kinases and assemblies of kinases organized into functional subnetworks leads to kinome dysregulation being a key driver of many diseases, particularly cancer. In the case of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a variety of kinases and associated signaling pathways have been identified for their key role in the establishment of disease as well as its progression. However, the identification of additional relevant therapeutic targets has been slow and is further confounded by interactions between the tumor and the surrounding tumor microenvironment. Fundamentally, it is an open question as to the degree to which knowledge of the state of the kinome at the protein level is able to provide insight into the downstream phenotype of the cell.","Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide a powerful means to identify loci and genes contributing to disease, but in many cases the related cell types/states through which genes confer disease risk remain unknown. Deciphering such relationships is important for identifying pathogenic processes and developing therapeutics. Here, we introduce sc-linker, a framework for integrating single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), epigenomic maps and GWAS summary statistics to infer the underlying cell types and processes by which genetic variants influence disease. We analyzed 1.6 million scRNA-seq profiles from 209 individuals spanning 11 tissue types and 6 disease conditions, and constructed gene programs capturing cell types, disease progression, and cellular processes both within and across cell types. We evaluated these gene programs for disease enrichment by transforming them to SNP annotations with tissue-specific epigenomic maps and computing enrichment scores across 60 diseases and complex traits (average N=297K). Cell type, disease progression, and cellular process programs captured distinct heritability signals even within the same cell type, as we show in multiple complex diseases that affect the brain (Alzheimer\u2019s disease, multiple sclerosis), colon (ulcerative colitis) and lung (asthma, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, severe COVID-19). The inferred disease enrichments recapitulated known biology and highlighted novel cell-disease relationships, including GABAergic neurons in major depressive disorder (MDD), a disease progression M cell program in ulcerative colitis, and a disease-specific complement cascade process in multiple sclerosis. In autoimmune disease, both healthy and disease progression immune cell type programs were associated, whereas for epithelial cells, disease progression programs were most prominent, perhaps suggesting a role in disease progression over initiation. Our framework provides a powerful approach for identifying the cell types and cellular processes by which genetic variants influence disease.","Transient interferon (IFN) induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) creates a formidable protective antiviral state. However, loss of appropriate control mechanisms can result in constitutive pathogenic ISG upregulation. Here, we used genome-wide loss-of-function screening to establish genes critical for IFN signaling, identifying all expected members of the JAK-STAT pathway and the previously unappreciated bromodomain-containing protein 9 (BRD9), a defining subunit of non-canonical BAF (ncBAF) chromatin remodeling complexes. Genetic knock-out or small-molecule mediated degradation of BRD9 limited IFN-induced expression of a subset of ISGs in multiple cell-types, and prevented IFN from exerting full antiviral activity against several RNA and DNA viruses. Mechanistically, BRD9 acts at the level of ISG transcription, exhibits a proximal association with STAT2 following IFN stimulation, and relies on its intact acetyl-binding bromodomain and unique ncBAF scaffolding function for activity. Given its druggability, BRD9 may be an attractive target for dampening constitutive ISG expression under certain pathogenic autoinflammatory conditions.","Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disease that is becoming a significant global health care problem. Several studies have shown that people with diabetes are more susceptible to oral problems, such as periodontitis and, although the causes are still inconclusive, the oral microbiota seems to be an important factor in this interaction. This study aimed to characterize the oral microbiome of a sample representing T2DM patients from Portugal and exploit potential associations between some microorganisms and variables like teeth brushing, smoking habits, and nutrient intake. By sequencing the hypervariable regions V3-V4 of the 16S rRNA gene in 50 individuals belonging to a group of diabetes patients and a control group, we found a total of 233 taxa, from which only 65% were shared between both groups. No differences were found in terms of alpha and beta diversity between groups or habits categories. Also, there were no significant differences in the oral microbiome profiles of control and diabetes patients. Only the class Synergistia and the genus TG5, which are related to periodontitis, were statistically more frequent in the control group. This finding can be justified by the fact that these diabetic patients usually have their oral health under close medical control than an average healthy person, which in this study was represented by the control group.","Milk has rich nutritional content packed with fats, proteins and water. It also contains beneficiary and non-beneficiary microbes which account for its short shelf life. Currently cold storage, pasteurization, ultra-high temperature, microfiltration and addition of lactose peroxidase are the methods of choice to control milk spoilage and prolong its shelf life. Their limitations include high energy consumption and loss of variable proportion of heat sensitive nutrients. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticle coated thin film was used in food packaging industry for its antimicrobial property. TiO2 thin films were synthesized by sol gel process; it was characterized with scanning electron microscopy which showed pore size as 5 \u03bcm and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy which showed metal present in sample is TiO2, zinc and silver. Exposure of raw milk at room temperature to TiO2 thin films doped with zinc or copper for a couple of hours showed zone of inhibition in disc diffusion technique, reduction in acid production. It also showed reduction in optical density indicating inhibition of growth in growth curve analysis, increase in the time required for methylene blue reduction and a five log folds decrease in bacterial count estimated using serial dilution plate count. The present studies were carried out under room temperature and pressure which is an added advantage in terms of energy as well as retention of nutrients. Though TiO2 is insoluble in water one needs to address it toxicity issues and adverse effects if any on the nutritional quality of milk before scaling up the process.","Treatment of the cytokine release syndrome (CRS) has become an important part of rescuing hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Here, we systematically explored the transcriptional regulators of inflammatory cytokines involved in the COVID-19 CRS to identify candidate transcription factors (TFs) for therapeutic targeting using approved drugs. We integrated a resource of TF-cytokine gene interactions with single-cell RNA-seq expression data from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cells of COVID-19 patients. We found 581 significantly correlated interactions, between 95 TFs and 16 cytokines upregulated in the COVID-19 patients, that may contribute to pathogenesis of the disease. Among these, we identified 19 TFs that are targets of FDA approved drugs. We investigated the potential therapeutic effect of 10 drugs and 25 drug combinations on inflammatory cytokine production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which revealed two drugs that inhibited cytokine production and numerous combinations that show synergistic efficacy in downregulating cytokine production. Further studies of these candidate repurposable drugs could lead to a therapeutic regimen to treat the CRS in COVID-19 patients.","Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are leading causes of death and drug withdrawals and frequently cooccur with comorbidities. However, systematic studies on the effects of drugs in comorbidities are lacking. Drug interactions with the cellular protein-protein interaction (PPI) network give rise to ADRs. We selected 6 comorbid disease pairs, identified the drugs used in the treatment of the individual diseases \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019\u2013 44 drugs in anxiety and depression, 128 in asthma and hypertension, 48 in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart failure, 58 in type 2 diabetes and obesity, 58 in Parkinson\u2019s disease and schizophrenia, and 84 in rheumatoid arthritis and osteoporosis \u2013 and categorized them based on whether they aggravate the comorbid condition. We constructed drug target networks (DTNs) and examined their enrichment among genes in disease A/B PPI networks, expressed across 53 tissues and involved in ~1000 pathways. To pinpoint the biological features characterizing the DTNs, we performed principal component analysis and computed the Euclidean distance between DTN component scores and feature loading values. DTNs of disease A drugs not contraindicated in B were affiliated with proteins common to A/B networks or uniquely found in the B network, similarly regulated common pathways, and disease-B specific pathways and tissues. DTNs of disease A drugs contraindicated in B were affiliated with common proteins or those uniquely found in the A network, differentially regulated common pathways, and disease A-specific pathways and tissues. Hence, DTN enrichment in pathways, tissues, and PPI networks of comorbid diseases will help identify drugs contraindications in comorbidities.","Cells can help each other replicate by communicating with diffusible molecules. In cell cultures, molecules may diffuse within a cell colony or between adjacent or distant colonies. Determining which cell helps which cell\u2019s replication is challenging. We developed a systematic approach, integrating modeling and experiments, for determining the length-scales of cell-cell communication (from microns to centimeters). With this approach, we discovered that differentiating murine ES cells, scattered across centimeters on a dish, communicate over millimeters to form one macroscopic entity that survives if and only if its centimeter-scale population-density is above a threshold value. Single-cell-level measurements, transcriptomics, and modeling revealed that this \u201cmacroscopic quorum sensing\u201d arises from differentiating ES cells secreting and sensing survival-promoting FGF4 that diffuses over millimeters and activates YAP1-induced survival mechanisms. Through the same mechanism, a lone macroscopic, but not microscopic, colony survives differentiation. Our work rigorously establishes that in vitro ES-cell differentiation relies on macroscopic cooperation.","","Chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) is the standard of care in B-cell malignancies. It is relying on synergistic effects of alkylating chemotherapy and monoclonal antibodies via secretory crosstalk with effector macrophages. Here, we observed that loss of p53 function mediates resistance to CIT by suppressing macrophage phagocytic function.","Psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia are commonly associated with structural brain alterations affecting the cortex, which frequently vary with clinically relevant factors including antipsychotic treatment, duration of illness and age of onset. While the underlying variables mediating these structural changes are poorly understood, recent genetic evidence suggests circulating metabolites and other biochemical traits play a causal role in a number of psychiatric disorders which could be mediated by changes in the cerebral cortex. In the current study, we leveraged publicly available genome-wide association study (GWAS) data to explore shared genetic architecture and evidence for causal relationships between a panel of 50 biochemical traits and measures of cortical thickness and surface area at both the global and regional levels. Linkage disequilibrium score regression identified a total of 20 significant and 156 suggestive genetically correlated biochemical-cortical trait pairings, of which six exhibited strong evidence for causality in a latent causal variable model. Interestingly, a negative causal relationship was identified between a unit increase in serum C-reactive protein levels and thickness of the lingual and lateral occipital regions that was also supported by Mendelian randomisation, while circulating vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D) levels exhibited a positive causal effect on temporal pole thickness. Taken together, our findings suggest a subset of biochemical traits exhibit shared genetic architecture and potentially causal relationships with cortical thickness in functionally distinct regions, which may contribute to alteration of cortical structure in psychiatric disorders.","The active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3), induces stable tolerogenesis in dendritic cells (DCs). This process involves the vitamin D receptor (VDR), which translocates to the nucleus, binds its cognate genomic sites, and promotes epigenetic and transcriptional remodeling. In this study, we investigated the interplay between the VDR and other transcription factors to induce DNA methylation changes that might provide phenotypic stability to the tolerogenic phenotype of DCs. Our study reveals the occurrence of vitamin D-specific DNA demethylation and transcriptional activation at VDR binding sites associated with the acquisition of tolerogenesis. Tolerogenic properties in DCs are acquired together with activation of the IL6-JAK-STAT3 pathway. In fact, VDR directly binds the IL6 gene, and JAK2-mediated STAT3 phosphorylation is specific to vitamin D stimulation. VDR and the phosphorylated form of STAT3 interact with each other and with methylcytosine dioxygenase TET2 following vitamin D treatment. Most importantly, pharmacological inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation reverts the vitamin-induced tolerogenic properties of DCs. Our results reveal an interplay between VDR and STAT3 leading to the DNA demethylation-dependent induction of tolerogenesis by vitamin D.","Acid ceramidase (Ac) is part of the sphingolipid metabolism and responsible for the degradation of ceramide. As bioactive molecule, ceramide is involved in the regulation of many cellular processes. However, the impact of cell-intrinsic Ac activity and ceramide on the course of Plasmodium infection remains elusive. Here, we use Ac-deficient mice with ubiquitously increased ceramide levels to elucidate the role of endogenous Ac activity in a murine malaria model. Interestingly, ablation of Ac leads to alleviated parasitemia associated with decreased T cell responses in the early phase of Plasmodium yoelii (P. yoelii) infection. Mechanistically, we identified dysregulated erythropoiesis with reduced numbers of reticulocytes, the preferred host cells of P. yoelii, in Ac-deficient mice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that administration of the Ac inhibitor carmofur to wild type mice has similar effects on P. yoelii infection and erythropoiesis. Notably, therapeutic carmofur treatment after manifestation of P. yoelii infection is efficient in reducing parasitemia. Hence, our results provide evidence for the involvement of Ac and ceramide in controlling P. yoelii infection by regulating red blood cell development.","Given the central role fertilization plays in the health and fitness of sexually reproducing organisms and the well-known evolutionary consequences of sexual selection and sperm competition, knowledge gained by a deeper understanding of sperm (and associated reproductive tissues) proteomes has proven critical to the field\u2019s advancement. Due to their extraordinary complexity, proteome depth-of-coverage is dependent on advancements in technology and related bioinformatics, both of which have made significant advancements in the decade since the last Drosophila sperm proteome was published. Here we provide an updated version of the Drosophila melanogaster sperm proteome (DmSP3) using improved separation and detection methods and an updated genome annotation. We identified 2563 proteins, with label-free quantitation (LFQ) for 2125 proteins. Combined with previous versions of the sperm proteome, the DmSP3 contains a total of 3176 proteins. The top 20 most abundant proteins contained the structural elements \u03b1- and \u03b2-tubulins and sperm leucyl-aminopeptidases (S-Laps). Both gene content and protein abundance were significantly reduced on the X chromosome, a finding consistent with prior genomic studies of the X chromosome gene content and evolution. We identified 9 of the 16 Y-linked proteins, including known testis-specific male fertility factors. LFQ measured significant levels for 75/83 ribosomal proteins (RPs) we identified, including a number of core constituents. The role of this unique subset of RPs in sperm is unknown. Surprisingly, our expanded sperm proteome also identified 122 seminal fluid proteins (Sfps), proteins found predominantly in the accessory glands. The possibility of tissue contamination from seminal vesicle or other reproductive tissues was addressed using concentrated salt and detergent treatments. Salt treatment had little effect on sperm proteome composition suggesting only minor contamination during sperm isolation while a significant fraction of Sfps remained associated with sperm following detergent treatment suggesting Sfps may arise within, and have additional functions, in sperm per se.","The role that vitamin D plays in pulmonary function remains uncertain. Epidemiological studies reported mixed findings for the association of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and pulmonary function. We conducted the largest cross-sectional meta-analysis of the 25(OH)D\u2013 pulmonary function association to date, based on nine European ancestry (EA) cohorts (n=22,838) and five African ancestry (AA) cohorts (n=4,290) in the CHARGE Consortium. Data were analyzed using linear models by cohort and ancestry. Effect modification by smoking status (current/former/never) was tested. Results were combined using fixed-effects meta-analysis. Mean (SD) serum 25(OH)D was 68 (29) nmol/L for EAs and 49 (21) nmol/L for AAs. For each 1 nmol/L higher 25(OH)D, forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) was higher by 1.1 mL in EAs (95% CI: 0.9,1.3; P=2.5\u00d710-21) and 1.8 mL (95% CI: 1.1,2.5; P=1.6\u00d710-7) in Aas (Prace difference=0.06), and forced vital capacity (FVC) was higher by 1.3 mL in EAs (95% CI: 1.0,1.6; P=1.1\u00d710-20) and 1.5 mL (95% CI: 0.8,2.3; P=1.2\u00d710-4) in AAs (Prace difference=0.56). Among EAs, the 25(OH)D\u2013FVC association was stronger in smokers: per 1nmol/L higher 25(OH)D, FVC was higher by 1.7 mL (95% CI: 1.1,2.3) for current smokers and 1.7 mL (95% CI: 1.2,2.1) for former smokers, compared to 0.8 mL (95% CI: 0.4,1.2) for never smokers. In summary, the 25(OH)D associations with FEV1 and FVC were positive in both ancestries. In EAs, a stronger association was observed for smokers compared to never smokers, which supports the importance of vitamin D in vulnerable populations.","Background COVID-19 has emerged as a global pandemic, affecting nearly 104 million people worldwide as of February 4th 2021. In previous published studies, the association between the mean Vit D status of each country and COVID-19 infection rate, and mortality among the adult population in European countries was examined. The aim of this study was to re-examine the relationship between the Vit D status of each country and COVID-19 infection, recovery, and mortality using updated data and a different methodological approach.","The extent to which genomic convergence shapes locally adapted phenotypes in different species remains a fundamental question in evolutionary biology. To bring new insights to this debate we set up a framework which aimed to compare the adaptive trajectories of two domesticated mammal species co-distributed in diversified landscapes. We sequenced the genomes of 160 sheep and 161 goats extensively managed along environmental gradients, including temperature, rainfall, seasonality and altitude, to identify genes and biological processes shaping local adaptation. Allele frequencies at adaptive loci were rarely found to vary gradually along environmental gradients, but rather displayed a discontinuous shift at the extremities of environmental clines. Of the more than 430 adaptive genes identified, only 6 were orthologous between sheep and goats and those responded differently to environmental pressures, suggesting different adaptive mechanisms in these two closely related species. Such diversity of adaptive pathways may result from a high number of biological functions involved in adaptation to multiple eco-climatic gradients, and provides more arguments for the role of contingency and stochasticity in adaptation rather than repeatability.","Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative infectious agent of tuberculosis (TB), kills more individuals per year than any other infectious agent. Granulomas, the hallmark of Mtb infection, are complex structures that form in lungs, composed of immune cells surrounding bacteria, infected cells, and a caseous necrotic core. While granulomas serve to physically contain and immunologically restrain bacteria growth, some granulomas are unable to control Mtb growth, leading to bacteria and infected cells leaving the granuloma and disseminating, either resulting in additional granuloma formation (local or non-local) or spread to airways or lymph nodes. Dissemination is associated with development of active TB. It is challenging to experimentally address specific mechanisms driving dissemination from TB lung granulomas. Herein, we develop a novel hybrid multi-scale computational model, MultiGran, that tracks Mtb infection within multiple granulomas in an entire lung. MultiGran follows cells, cytokines, and bacterial populations within each lung granuloma throughout the course of infection and is calibrated to multiple non-human primate (NHP) cellular, granuloma, and whole-lung datasets. We show that MultiGran can recapitulate patterns of in vivo local and non-local dissemination, predict likelihood of dissemination, and predict a crucial role for multifunctional CD8+ T cells and macrophage dynamics for preventing dissemination.","The interaction between inclement weather and disease acquisition is a long-recognized relationship. In the case of coccidiosis, a parasitic infestation of the intestines, wet weather is known to promote incidences in livestock. Our opportunistic investigation tracks blood chemistries of goats that were exposed to coccidian in a 100 year rain event in Oklahoma. Our results suggest a potentially patterned response of blood chemistries that may be developed into a clinical tool in the future and provide warnings for producers of the risks associated with growing incidences of excessively wet weather related to climate change.","Objectives Reports early in the epidemic linking low mean national Vitamin D level with increased COVID-19 death, and until recently little research on the impact of Vitamin D deficiency on severity of COVID-19, led to this update of the initial report studying mortality up to the end of January 2021.","Infection with the human-tropic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a strong risk factor for multiple sclerosis (MS), though the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To investigate EBV infection directly, we induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in immunocompromised mice humanized with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from individuals with or without a history of EBV infection and/or diagnosis of relapsing MS. HuPBMC EAE mice generated from EBV seronegative healthy donors (HD) were less susceptible to developing severe clinical symptoms than EBV seropositive cohorts. Donor EBV seropositivity and RRMS diagnosis led to a significant incremental increase in the human Th1:Treg CD4+ T cell ratio in the brain and spinal cord, as well as increased human cytotoxic CD8+ T cell and murine macrophage infiltration and demyelination. The data indicate that a history of EBV infection, further compounded by a diagnosis of RRMS, promotes Th1-mediated disease in a novel humanized mouse model of MS.","A clinically actionable understanding of multiple sclerosis (MS) etiology goes through GWAS interpretation, prompting research on new gene regulatory models. We previously suggested a stochastic etiologic model where small-scale random perturbations could reach a threshold for MS development. The recently described mapping of the transient transcriptome (TT), including intergenic and intronic RNAs, seems appropriate to verify this model through a rigorous colocalization analysis. We show that genomic regions coding for the TT were significantly enriched for MS-associated GWAS variants and DNA binding sites for molecular transducers mediating putative, non-genetic, etiopathogenetic factors for MS (e.g., vitamin D deficiency, Epstein Barr virus latent infection, B cell dysfunction). These results suggest a model whereby TT-coding regions are hotspots of convergence between genetic ad non-genetic factors of risk/protection for MS, and plausibly for other complex disorders. Our colocalization analysis also provides a freely available data resource (www.mscoloc.com) for future research on MS transcriptional regulation.","Objective Studies have demonstrated a potential link between low vitamin D levels and both an increased risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and poorer clinical outcomes but have not established temporality. This retrospective study examined if, and to what degree, a relationship exists between pre-infection serum vitamin D levels and disease severity and mortality of SARS-CoV-19.","In order to explore opportunities for personalized and predictive health care, we collected serial clinical measurements, health surveys and multiomics profiles (genomics, proteomics, autoantibodies, metabolomics and gut microbiome) from 96 individuals. The participants underwent data-driven health coaching over a 16-month period with continuous digital monitoring of activity and sleep. Multiomics factor analysis resulted in an unsupervised, data-driven and integrated view of human health, revealing distinct and independent molecular factors linked to obesity, diabetes, liver function, cardiovascular disease, inflammation, immunity, exercise, diet and hormonal effects. The data revealed novel and previously uncovered associations between risk factors, molecular pathways, and quantitative lifestyle parameters. For example, ethinyl estradiol use had a distinct impact on metabolites, proteins and physiology. Multidimensional molecular and digital health signatures uncovered biological variability between people and quantitative effects of lifestyle changes, hence illustrating the value of the combined use of molecular and digital monitoring of human health."],"title":["Ongoing exposure to peritoneal dialysis fluid alters resident peritoneal macrophage phenotype and activation propensity","Chemical

When calcium is included to a final concentration of 1.5 \u2013 3.0 mM (provided either as a single agent or as a combination of calcium and minerals), there is little change in tight junction proteins but a strong up-regulation of desmosomal proteins and an increase in desmosome formation. The aim of this study was to assess functional consequences of the differences in calcium-mediated barrier protein expression.","Background Examining inflammation-related DNA methylation alterations in blood could help elucidate the role of inflammation in lung cancer etiology and aid discovery of factors that are key to lung cancer development and progression. In a nested case-control study, we estimated the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio using a validated index, methylation-derived NLR (mdNLR), and quantified DNA methylation levels at loci previously linked with circulating concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP). We examined associations between these measures and lung cancer risk, and among the cases, lung cancer survival, using pre-diagnostic blood samples of cases (median of 14 years before diagnosis) and controls in the CLUE I/II cohorts. Our analyses controlled for self-reported smoking and methylation-predicted cumulative smoking in order to better focus our examinations on the DNA methylation marks that are informative of the immune response profile.","Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a more continuous alternative to haemodialysis, for patients with chronic kidney disease, with considerable initial benefits for survival, patient independence and healthcare costs. However, longterm PD is associated with significant pathology, negating the positive effects over haemodialysis. Importantly, peritonitis and activation of macrophages is closely associated with disease progression and treatment failure. However, recent advances in macrophage biology suggest opposite functions for macrophages of different cellular origins. While monocyte-derived macrophages promote disease progression in some models of fibrosis, tissue resident macrophages have rather been associated with protective roles. Thus, we aimed to identify the relative contribution of tissue resident macrophages to PD induced inflammation in mice. Unexpectedly, we found an incremental loss of homeostatic characteristics, anti-inflammatory and efferocytic functionality in peritoneal resident macrophages, accompanied by enhanced inflammatory responses to external stimuli. Moreover, presence of glucose degradation products within the dialysis fluid led to markedly enhanced inflammation and almost complete disappearance of tissue resident cells. Thus, alterations in tissue resident macrophages may render longterm PD patients sensitive to developing peritonitis and consequently fibrosis/sclerosis.","Point-of-care testing (POCT) offers several advantages over traditional laboratory testing. Offering less invasive testing with a faster turnaround time is not enough if not associated with an acceptable level of accuracy. Here, we show the analytical validation behind the multi-analyte POCT immunochromatography analyser, Hilab Flow (HiF). Analyses from 4,518 clinical samples were compared to College of American Pathologists accredited laboratories for ten quantitative and thirteen qualitative exams. Compatibility between methods was evaluated in terms of association/correlation and clinical agreement. Strong correlation/ concordance was observed between quantitative (CHOL, HDL-c, TG, HbA1c, Glycemia, 25-Hydroxy Vitamin D, TSH, Uric Acid, Creatinine, Urea) and qualitative methods (COVID-19 IgG/ IgM, Beta-hCG, Syphilis, Anti-HBsAg, Zika IgG/ IgM, Influenza A/B, HIV, HCV, HBsAg, Dengue NS1, COVID-19 Ag, Dengue IgG/ IgM, PSA). Approval criteria was obtaining a kappa agreement &gt; 0.8 or a Pearson correlation &gt; 0.9 depending on the exam. Overall percentage agreement was greater than 95% for all exams, indicating a good clinical agreement to gold-standard laboratory-based tests. Results indicate all exams are suitable for POCT and present a reliable performance. Data support the analyser is a useful tool to aid decision-making at the clinical setting, with potential to contribute with healthcare solutions in diagnostic medicine worldwide.","Dyslipidemia is a well-established risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Although, advances in genome-wide technologies have enabled the discovery of hundreds of genes associated with blood lipid phenotypes, most of the heritability remains unexplained. Here we performed targeted resequencing of 13 bona fide candidate genes of dyslipidemia to identify the underlying biological functions. We sequenced 940 Sikh subjects with extreme serum levels of hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) and 2,355 subjects were used for replication studies; all 3,295 participants were part of the Asian Indians Diabetic Heart Study. Gene-centric analysis revealed a burden of variants for increasing HTG risk in GCKR (p=2.1\u00d710\u22125), LPL (p=1.6\u00d710\u22123) and MLXIPL (p=1.6\u00d710\u22122) genes. Of these, three missense and damaging variants within GCKR were further examined for functional consequences in vivo using a transgenic zebrafish model. All three mutations were South Asian population-specific and were largely absent in other multiethnic populations of the Exome Aggregation Consortium. We built different transgenic models of human GCKR with and without mutations and analyzed the effects of dietary changes in vivo. Despite the short-term feeding, profound phenotypic changes were apparent in hepatocyte histology and fat deposition associated with increased expression of GCKR in response to a high fat diet (HFD). Liver histology of the GCKRmut showed severe fatty metamorphosis which correlated with ~7 fold increase in the mRNA expression in the GCKRmut fish even in the absence of a high fat diet. These findings suggest that functionally disruptive GCKR variants not only increase the risk of HTG but may enhance ectopic lipid/fat storage defects in the absence of obesity and HFD. To our knowledge, this is the first transgenic zebrafish model of a putative human disease gene built to accurately assess the influence of rare genetic changes and their phenotypic consequences in vivo.","Objective We quantified changes in dispensing of common medicines proposed for \u201cre-purposing\u201d due to their perceived benefits as therapeutic or preventive for COVID-19 in Australia, a country with relatively low COVID-19 incidence in the first year of the pandemic.","Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is a bone-derived hormone that binds to binary FGFR/\u03b1-Klotho receptor complexes in the kidney tubules to inhibit phosphate reabsorption and 1,25(OH)2D production. Excess FGF23 causes X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) and tumor induced osteomalacia (TIO). Recently, Burosumab, an FGF23 blocking antibody, was approved for treating these hypophosphatemic disorders. A small molecule inhibitor that specifically binds to FGF23 to prevent activation of FGFR/\u03b1-Klotho complexes has potential advantages over a systemically administered FGF23 blocking antibody. We previously identified the small molecule ZINC13407541 (N-[[2-(2-phenylethenyl)cyclopenten-1-yl]methylidene]hydroxylamine) as a therapeutic lead FGF23 antagonist. Additional structure-activity studies developed a series of ZINC13407541 analogues with enhanced drug-like properties. In this study, we tested in a pre-clinical Hyp mouse homologue of XLH a direct connect analogue (8n) [(E)-2-(4-(tert-butyl)phenyl)cyclopent-1-ene-1-carbaldehyde oxime] that exhibited the greatest stability in microsomal assays, and 13a [(E)-2-((E)-4-methylstyryl)benzaldehyde oxime] that exhibited increased in vitro potency. We found that pharmacological inhibition of FGF23 with either of these compounds blocked FGF23 signaling and significantly increased serum phosphate and 1,25(OH)2D concentrations in Hyp mice. Long-term parenteral treatment with 8n or 13a also enhanced linear bone growth, increased mineralization of bone, and narrowed the growth plate in Hyp mice. The more potent 13a compound showed greater therapeutic efficacy in Hyp mice. Further optimization of these FGF23 inhibitors may lead to versatile drugs to treat FGF23-mediated disorders.","Importance Although the international community collectively seeks to reduce global temperature rise to less than 1.5\u00baC, there are already irreversible environmental changes that have occurred, and currently available evidence suggests these changes will continue to occur. As we begin to witness the effects of a warming planet on human health, it is imperative that as neurologists we anticipate the ways in which the epidemiology and incidence of neurologic disease may be affected.","COVID-19 vaccines are safe and highly effective, but some individuals experience unpleasant reactions to vaccination. As the majority of adults in the US have received a COVID-19 vaccine this year, there is an unprecedented opportunity to study the genetics of reactions to vaccination via surveys of individuals who are already part of genetic research studies. Here, we have queried 17,440 participants in the Helix DNA Discovery Project and Healthy Nevada Project about their reactions to COVID-19 vaccination. Our GWAS identifies an association between severe difficulties with daily routine after vaccination and HLA-A*03:01. This association was statistically significant only for those who received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine (BNT162b2; p=4.70E-11), but showed a trending association in those who received the Moderna vaccine (mRNA-1273; p=0.005) despite similar sample sizes for study. In Pfizer-BioNTech recipients, HLA-A*03:01 was associated with a two-fold increase in risk of severe vaccine reactions. The effect was consistent across ages, sexes, and whether the person had previously had a COVID-19 infection. The reactions experienced by HLA-A*03:01 carriers were driven by associations with chills, fever, fatigue, and in general feeling unwell.","Despite the high incidence of osteoporosis, many patients at risk of fragility fractures may not initiate treatment due to concerns about side effects, or cost. We aimed to identify whether the patient population presenting with fragility fractures is receiving prophylactic treatment for osteoporosis within a single academic hospital in the southernmost region of the United States. This region is characterized by a high number of patients from Hispanic/Latino heritage (80%) and reduced access to healthcare services. We conducted a three-year, retrospective cohort study of patients presenting with low impact fractures of the humerus or the shoulder griddle, lower end of radius or ulna and forearm, hip fractures (femoral neck, intertrochanteric/subtrochanteric), the lower end of tibia, medial malleolus, lateral malleolus or lower leg. Male and female subjects of 50 years or older were included. Demographic data and information on medications reported at fracture presentation were extracted from electronic medical records. We found that 42% of the patients were taking at least one medication to prevent osteoporosis. The predominant combination was vitamin D plus calcium and bisphosphonates. If patients taking only vitamin D plus calcium are excluded, 16.7% of the sample took osteoporosis medications at the fragility fracture presentation. The likelihood of taking osteoporosis medication was increased by age and type of health insurance (Medicare/private insurance), and concomitant diagnosis of impaired gait and mobility. The percentage of the patients taking prophylactic medications for osteoporosis at the time of a fragility fracture was comparable to reported national standards and associated with increased age and health insurance coverage. In a predominantly Hispanic/Latino patient population living in a medically underserved region, there is substantial recognition and prevention strategies for osteoporosis.","It has been widely recognized that a critical time window for neurodevelopment occurs in early life, and that the host\u2019s gut microbiome plays an important role in neurodevelopment. While murine models have demonstrated that the maternal gut microbiome also influences offspring brain development, for humans it is still unclear if the critical time window for the association between the gut microbiome and neurodevelopment is prenatal, postnatal or both. Here we leverage a large-scale human study and compare the associations between the gut microbiota and metabolites from mothers and their children with the children\u2019s neurodevelopment. We show, for the first time, that the maternal gut microbiome is more relevant than the children\u2019s gut microbiome to the children\u2019s neurodevelopment in the first year of life. Interestingly, the roles of the same taxa with respect to neurodevelopment can be opposite at the two stages of fetal neurodevelopment. These findings shed light on potential therapeutic interventions to prevent neurodevelopmental disorders.","Species showing repeated evolution of similar traits can help illuminate the molecular and developmental basis of diverging traits and specific adaptations. Following the last glacial period, dwarfism and specialized bottom feeding morphology evolved rapidly in several landlocked Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) populations in Iceland. To initiate study of the genetic divergence between small benthic morphs and larger morphs with limnetic morphotype, we conducted an RNA-seq transcriptome analysis of developing charr. We sequenced mRNA from whole embryos at four stages in early development of two stocks with contrasting morphologies, the small benthic (SB) charr from Lake Thingvallavatn and Holar aquaculture (AC) charr.","Satellite glia are the major glial type found in ganglia of the peripheral nervous system and wrap around cell bodies of sympathetic and sensory neurons that are very diverse. Other than their close physical association with peripheral neurons, little is known about this glial population. Here, we performed single cell RNA sequencing analysis and identified five different populations of satellite glia from sympathetic and sensory ganglia. We identified three shared populations of satellite glia enriched in immune-response genes, immediate-early genes and ion channels/ECM-interactors, respectively. Sensory- and sympathetic-specific satellite glia are differentially enriched for modulators of lipid synthesis and metabolism. Sensory glia are also specifically enriched for genes involved in glutamate turnover. Further, satellite glia and Schwann cells can be distinguished by unique transcriptional signatures. This study reveals remarkable heterogeneity of satellite glia in the peripheral nervous system.","Background The impact of COVID-19 varies markedly, not only between individual patients but also between different populations. We hypothesised that differences in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes might influence this variation.","Background &amp; Aims New York is the current epicenter of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The underrepresented minorities, where the prevalence of obesity is higher, appear to be affected disproportionally. Our objectives were to assess the characteristics and early outcomes of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the Bronx and investigate whether obesity is associated with worse outcomes.","Vitamin D3 (vitD3) and its active metabolite, calcitriol (1,25-(OH)2D3), affect multiple tissue types by interacting with the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Although vitD3 deficiency has been correlated with increased incidence of breast cancer and less favorable outcomes across ethnic groups and latitudes, randomized human clinical trials have yet to provide conclusive evidence on the efficacy of vitD3 in treating and/or preventing breast cancer. When considering that carcinogenesis is \u201cdevelopment gone awry\u201d, it becomes imperative to understand the role of vitD3 during breast development. Mammary gland development in VDR KO mice is altered by increased ductal elongation and lateral branching during puberty, precocious and increased alveologenesis at pregnancy and delayed post-lactational involution. These developmental processes are largely influenced by mammotropic hormones, i.e., ductal elongation by estrogen, branching by progesterone and alveologenesis by prolactin. However, research on vitD3\u2019s effects on mammary gland morphogenesis focused on cell proliferation and apoptosis in 2D culture models and utilized supra-physiological doses of vitD3, conditions that spare the microenvironment in which morphogenesis takes place. Here, using two 3D culture models, we investigated the role of vitD3 in mammary epithelial morphogenesis. We found that vitD3 interferes with estrogen\u2019s actions on T47D human breast cancer cells in 3D differently at different doses, and recapitulates what is observed in vivo. Also, vitD3 can act autonomously and affect the organization of MCF10A cells in 3D collagen matrix by influencing collagen fiber organization. Thus, we uncovered how vitD3 modulates mammary tissue organization independent of its already known effects on cell proliferation.","Mendelian Randomisation (MR) is a powerful tool in epidemiology to estimate the causal effect of an exposure on an outcome in the presence of unobserved confounding, by utilising genetic variants as instrumental variables (IVs) for the exposure. The effects obtained from MR studies are often interpreted as the lifetime effect of the exposure in question. However, the causal effects of many exposures are thought to vary throughout an individual\u2019s lifetime and there may be periods during which an exposure has more of an effect on a particular outcome. Multivariable MR (MVMR) is an extension of MR that allows for multiple, potentially highly related, exposures to be included in an MR estimation. MVMR estimates the direct effect of each exposure on the outcome conditional on all of the other exposures included in the estimation. We explore the use of MVMR to estimate the direct effect of a single exposure at different time points in an individual\u2019s lifetime on an outcome. We use simulations to illustrate the interpretation of the results from such analyses and the key assumptions required. We show that causal effects at different time periods can be estimated through MVMR when the association between the genetic variants used as instruments and the exposure measured at those time periods varies, however this estimation will not necessarily identify exact time periods over which an exposure has the most effect on the outcome. We illustrate the method through estimation of the causal effects of childhood and adult BMI on smoking behaviour.","Medicine is moving from a curative discipline to a preventative discipline relying on personalised and precise treatment plans. The complex and multi level pathophysiological patterns of most diseases require a systemic medicine approach and are challenging current medical therapies. On the other hand, computational medicine is a vibrant interdisciplinary field that could help move from an organ-centered approach to a process-oriented approach. The ideal computational patient would require an international interdisciplinary effort, of larger scientific and technological interdisciplinarity than the Human Genome Project. When deployed, such a patient would have a profound impact on how healthcare is delivered to patients. Here we present a computational patient model that integrates, refines and extends recent mechanistic or phenomenological models of cardiovascular, RAS and diabetic processes. Our aim is twofold: analyse the modularity and composability of the model-building blocks of the computational patient and to study the dynamical properties of well-being and disease states in a broader functional context. We present results from a number of experiments among which we characterise the dynamic impact of COVID-19 and type-2 diabetes (T2D) on cardiovascular and inflammation conditions. We tested these experiments under different exercise, meal and drug regimens. We report results showing the striking importance of transient dynamical responses to acute state conditions and we provide guidelines for system design principles for the inter-relationship between modules and components in systemic medicine. Finally this initial computational Patient can be used as a toolbox for further modifications and extensions.","Suspended animation states such as hibernation or diapause allow organisms to survive extreme environments. But the mechanisms underlying the evolution of these extreme survival states are unknown. The African turquoise killifish has evolved diapause as a form of suspended development to survive the complete drought that occurs every year in its habitat. Here we show that many gene duplicates \u2013 paralogs \u2013 exhibit specialized expression in diapause versus normal development in the African turquoise killifish. Surprisingly, paralogs with specialized expression in diapause are evolutionarily very ancient, and they are also present even in vertebrates that do not exhibit diapause. Profiling the chromatin accessibility landscape among different fish species reveals an evolutionarily recent increase in chromatin accessibility at these very ancient paralogs, suggesting rewiring of their regulatory landscape. The increase in chromatin accessibility in the African turquoise killifish is linked to the presence of new binding sites for transcription factors (e.g., FOXO, REST, and PPAR), due to both de novo mutations and transposable element insertion. Interestingly, accessible chromatin regions in diapause are enriched for lipid metabolism genes. By performing lipidomics in different fish species, we uncover a specific lipid profile in African turquoise killifish embryos in diapause. Notably, select very long-chain fatty acids are high in diapause, suggesting they may be used for long-term survival in this state. Together, our multi-omic analysis indicates that diapause is driven by regulatory innovation of very ancient gene programs that are critical for survival. Our work also suggests a mechanism for how complex adaptations evolve in nature and offers strategies by which a suspended animation program could be reactivated in other species for long-term preservation.","Manipulations to set back biological age and extend lifespan in animal models are well established, and translation to humans has begun. The length of human life makes it impractical to evaluate results by plotting mortality curves, so surrogate markers of age have been suggested and, at present, the best established surrogates are DNA methylation clocks. Herein we report on a randomized, controlled clinical trial designed to be a first step in evaluating the effect of a diet and lifestyle intervention on biological age. Compared to participants in the control group (n=20), participants in the treatment group tested an average 3.23 years younger at the end of the eight-week program according to the Horvath DNAmAge clock (p=0.018). Those in the treatment group (n=18) tested an average 1.96 years younger at the end of the program compared to the same individuals at the beginning with a strong trend towards significance (p=0.066 for within group change). This is the first such trial to demonstrate a potential reversal of biological age. In this study, the intervention was confined to diet and lifestyle changes previously identified as safe to use. The prescribed program included multiple components with documented mechanistic activity on epigenetic pathways, including moderate exercise, breathing exercises for stress, and a diet rich in methyl donor nutrients and polyphenols.","Importance Conflict of interest as it relates to medical education is a topic of concern. Dermatology journals, periodicals, editorials, and news magazines are influential resources that are not uniformly regulated and subject to influence from the pharmaceutical industry.","Purpose Pregnancy is a valuable model to study the association between DNA methylation and several cardiometabolic traits, due to its direct potential to influence mother\u2019s and child\u2019s health. Epigenetics in Pregnancy (EPIPREG) is a population-based sample with the aim to study associations between DNA-methylation in pregnancy and cardiometabolic traits in South Asian and European pregnant women and their offspring.","Steroid hormones promote stem cell self-renewal in many tissues; however, the molecular mechanisms by which hormone signaling is integrated with niche-derived signals are largely uncharacterized. In the Drosophila ovary, the steroid hormone ecdysone promotes germline stem cell (GSC) self-renewal. Despite strong evidence that ecdysone modulates the reception of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signals in GSCs, transcriptional targets of ecdysone signaling that facilitate BMP reception are unknown. Here, we report that ecdysone signaling promotes the expression of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) squid, hephaestus, Hrb27C, and Hrb87F in GSCs. These hnRNPs functionally interact with ecdysone signaling to control GSC number and are cell autonomously required in GSCs for their maintenance. We demonstrate that hnRNPs promote GSC self-renewal by binding to transcripts essential for proper BMP signaling, including the BMP receptors thickveins and punt. Our findings support the model that stem cells coordinate local and long-range signals at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels to maintain self-renewal in response to physiological demand.","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Large registry studies have demonstrated a dose response relationship between TBI and neurodegenerative disease ; however, disentangling the direct effects of TBI from ageing and/or a progressive neurodegenerative process is problematic. This study is a prospective long-term cohort study to examine a population of retired elite athletes at high risk of concussion and mTBI during their sporting careers compared to age, and sex-matched controls with no history of TBI. The aim is to determine the incidence and risk factors for neurodegenerative disease and/or age-related effects on brain health in this population","With the continuing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic coupled with phased reopening, it is critical to identify risk factors associated with susceptibility and severity of disease in a diverse population to help shape government policies, guide clinical decision making, and prioritize future COVID-19 research. In this retrospective case-control study, we used de-identified electronic health records (EHR) from the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Health System between March 9th, 2020 and June 14th, 2020 to identify risk factors for COVID-19 susceptibility (severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) PCR test positive), inpatient admission, and severe outcomes (treatment in an intensive care unit or intubation). Of the 26,602 individuals tested by PCR for SARS-CoV-2, 992 were COVID-19 positive (3.7% of Tested), 220 were admitted in the hospital (22% of COVID-19 positive), and 77 had a severe outcome (35% of Inpatient). Consistent with previous studies, males and individuals older than 65 years old had increased risk of inpatient admission. Notably, individuals self-identifying as Hispanic or Latino constituted an increasing percentage of COVID-19 patients as disease severity escalated, comprising 24% of those testing positive, but 40% of those with a severe outcome, a disparity that remained after correcting for medical co-morbidities. Cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and renal disease were premorbid risk factors present before SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing associated with COVID-19 susceptibility. Less well-established risk factors for COVID-19 susceptibility included pre-existing dementia (odds ratio (OR) 5.2 [3.2-8.3], p=2.6 \u00d7 10\u221210), mental health conditions (depression OR 2.1 [1.6-2.8], p=1.1 \u00d7 10\u22126) and vitamin D deficiency (OR 1.8 [1.4-2.2], p=5.7 \u00d7 10\u22126). Renal diseases including end-stage renal disease and anemia due to chronic renal disease were the predominant premorbid risk factors for COVID-19 inpatient admission. Other less established risk factors for COVID-19 inpatient admission included previous renal transplant (OR 9.7 [2.8-39], p=3.2\u00d710\u22124) and disorders of the immune system (OR 6.0 [2.3, 16], p=2.7\u00d710\u22124). Prior use of oral steroid medications was associated with decreased COVID-19 positive testing risk (OR 0.61 [0.45, 0.81], p=4.3\u00d710\u22124), but increased inpatient admission risk (OR 4.5 [2.3, 8.9], p=1.8\u00d710\u22125). We did not observe that prior use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers increased the risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, being admitted to the hospital, or having a severe outcome. This study involving direct EHR extraction identified known and less well-established demographics, and prior diagnoses and medications as risk factors for COVID-19 susceptibility and inpatient admission. Knowledge of these risk factors including marked ethnic disparities observed in disease severity should guide government policies, identify at-risk populations, inform clinical decision making, and prioritize future COVID-19 research.","Osteoporosis is a systemic chronic skeletal disease, which is characterized by low bone mineral density (BMD) and increased risk to osteoporotic fractures (OFs). OFs are associated with high mortality and morbidity, and seriously affect the life quality of patients. Osteoporosis is prevalent in the middle-aged and elderly population, especially the postmenopausal women. With population aging, osteoporosis becomes a world-wide serious public health problem. Early recognition of the high-risk population followed by timely and efficient intervention and/or treatment is important for preventing OFs. In light of the high heritability and complex pathogenesis of OP, comprehensive consideration of significant biological/biochemical factors is necessary for accurate risk evaluation. For this purpose, we reviewed recent research progress on moleculars which are diagnostic and/or predictive of OFs risk. Future integrative analyses and systematic evaluation of these moleculars may facilitate developing novel methodologies and/or test strategies, i.e., biochips, for early recognition of osteoporosis, hence to contribute to preventing OFs in the world.","  Although Vitamin D is believed to be involved in a large number of immune\nresponses our understanding of these processes at cellular level remained at\ninfancy. We develop and solve a coarse grained kinetic network model to\nquantify the effects of variation of vitamin D on human immunity. The system of\nequations accounts for known inter-relation between active and inactive vitamin\nD, antigen presenting cells, effector T cells, regulatory T cells and pathogen.\nBoth time dependent and steady state solutions are obtained. The time dependent\nsolution of the system of equations reveals that the immune response is rather\nstrongly regulated in presence of vitamin D. We found quantitatively that lower\nthan optimum levels of concentration of active vitamin D correspond to weak\nregulation where, once a pathogen/antigen enters the body, the nature of the\nimmune response would be less regulatory and hence more aggressive, or\ninflammatory. The steady state solution of our model shows that vitamin D\nenhances the tolerance level of immune system, thereby increasing resistance to\nautoimmune diseases. Our model and accompanied numerical analyses reveal\nanother important aspect of immunity: While extremely low levels of vitamin D\ncould lead to increased risk of autoimmune responses, an overdose (toxic) level\nwould give rise to too large a tolerant response, leading to the increased risk\nof tumors and cancerous cell growth.\n","Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) are the central component of peripheral immune tolerance. While dysregulation of the Treg cytokine signature has been observed in autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and type 1 diabetes, the regulatory mechanisms balancing pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine production are not known. Here, we identify imbalance between IFN\u03b3 and IL-10 as a shared Treg signature, present in patients with MS and under high salt conditions. By performing RNA-seq analysis on human Treg subpopulations, we identify \u03b2-catenin as a key regulator that controls the expression of IFN\u03b3 and IL-10. The activated \u03b2-catenin signature is enriched specifically in IFN\u03b3+Tregs in humans, and this was confirmed in vivo with Treg-specific \u03b2-catenin-stabilized mice exhibiting lethal autoimmunity with a dysfunctional, IFN\u03b3-producing, Treg phenotype. Moreover, we identify PTGER2 as a major factor balancing IFN\u03b3 and IL-10 production in the context of a high salt environment, with skewed activation of the \u03b2-catenin/SGK1/Foxo axis in IFN\u03b3+Tregs. These findings identify a novel molecular mechanism underlying inflammatory Tregs in human autoimmune disease and reveal a new role for a PTGER2-\u03b2-catenin loop in Tregs linking environmental high salt conditions to autoimmunity.","This study aimed to assess the renopreventive effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), enalapril, and/or vitamin D receptor (VDR) activator, paricalcitol, on streptozotocin (STZ) diabetes-induced nephropathy and to elucidate the mechanisms of action through investigation of the effects on renal oxidative stress, antioxidant defense system and expressions of TNF-\u03b1, P53, caspase-3, and Bcl-2. Diabetes mellitus was induced in fasting male Wistar rats by single intraperitoneal injection of STZ (45 mg /kg b.w.) dissolved in citrate buffer pH 4.5. Ten days after STZ injection, the diabetic rats were treated with enalapril (25 mg/l of drinking water) and/or paricalcitol (8 \u00b5g/kg b.w. per os) dissolved in 5% DMSO daily for 4 weeks. The obtained data revealed that the treatment of diabetic Wistar rats with enalapril and/or paricalcitol led to a significant decrease in the elevated serum urea, uric acid, creatinine and sodium, potassium levels; thereby reflecting improvement of the impaired kidney function. The deteriorated kidney lipid peroxidation, GSH content and GST and catalase activities in diabetic rats were significantly ameliorated as a result of treatment with enalapril and/or paricalcitol. The elevated fasting and post-prandial serum glucose levels and the lowered serum insulin and C-peptide levels were also improved. Moreover, the treatment of diabetic rats successfully prevented the diabetes-induced histopathological deleterious changes of kidney and islets of Langerhans of pancreas. In association, the immunohistochemically detected pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1 and apoptotic mediators P53 and caspase-3 were remarkably decreased in kidney of diabetic rats as a result of treatment, while the expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 was increased. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that enalapril and paricalcitol can prevent STZ diabetes-induced nephropathy though amelioration of the glycemic state and antioxidant defense system together with the suppression of oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis.","Fabrication of microfluidic devices by photolithography generally requires specialized training and access to a cleanroom. As an alternative, 3D printing enables cost-effective fabrication of microdevices with complex features that would be suitable for many biomedical applications. However, commonly used resins are cytotoxic and unsuitable for devices involving cells. Furthermore, 3D prints are generally refractory to elastomer polymerization such that they cannot be used as master molds for fabricating devices from polymers (e.g. polydimethylsiloxane, or PDMS). Different post-print treatment strategies, such as heat curing, ultraviolet light exposure, and coating with silanes, have been explored to overcome these obstacles, but none have proven universally effective. Here, we show that deposition of a thin layer of parylene, a polymer commonly used for medical device applications, renders 3D prints biocompatible and allows them to be used as master molds for elastomeric device fabrication. When placed in culture dishes containing human neurons, regardless of resin type, uncoated 3D prints leached toxic material to yield complete cell death within 48 hours, whereas cells exhibited uniform viability and healthy morphology out to 21 days if the prints were coated with parylene. Diverse PDMS devices of different shapes and sizes were easily casted from parylene-coated 3D printed molds without any visible defects. As a proof-of-concept, we rapid prototyped and tested different types of PDMS devices, including triple chamber perfusion chips, droplet generators, and microwells. Overall, we suggest that the simplicity and reproducibility of this technique will make it attractive for fabricating traditional microdevices and rapid prototyping new designs. In particular, by minimizing user intervention on the fabrication and post-print treatment steps, our strategy could help make microfluidics more accessible to the biomedical research community.","Differential diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) and latent TB infection (LTBI) remains a public health priority in high TB burden countries. Pulmonary TB is diagnosed by sputum smear microscopy, chest X-rays, and PCR tests for distinct Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) genes. Clinical tests to diagnose LTBI rely on immune cell stimulation in blood plasma with TB-specific antigens followed by measurements of interferon-\u03b3 concentrations. The latter is an important cytokine for cellular immune responses against Mtb in infected lung tissue. Sputum smear microscopy and chest X-rays are not sufficiently sensitive while both PCR and interferon-\u03b3 release assays are expensive. Alternative biomarkers useful for developing diagnostic tests to discern TB disease states are desirable. This study\u2019s objective was to discover biomarkers in sputum, assessing the proteomes and microbiomes of 74 TB patients, 46 individuals with LTBI, and 51 negative community controls (NCC). Study participants were from the South Omo province, a pastoral region in southern Ethiopia. A total of 161 and 115 samples were used to determine the 16S rRNA sequence-based bacterial taxonomies and proteomic profiles, respectively. Sputum microbiota did not reveal statistically significant differences in \u03b1-diversity comparing the three groups. The genus Mycobacterium, representing Mtb, was only identified for the TB group. The latter featured reduced abundance of the genus Rothia in comparison to the LTBI and NCC groups. Rothia is a human respiratory tract commensal and may be sensitive to the inflammatory milieu caused by TB infection. Proteomic data strongly supported innate immune responses against Mtb in subjects with pulmonary TB. Ferritin, an iron storage protein released by damaged host cells, was markedly increased in abundance in TB sputum compared to the LTBI and NCC groups, along with \u03b1-1-acid glycoproteins ORM1 and ORM2. These proteins are acute phase reactants and inhibit excessive neutrophil activation. Proteomic data also supported effector roles of neutrophils in the anti-Mtb response which was not observed for LTBI cases. Less abundant in sputum of the LTBI group versus the NCC group were two immunomodulatory proteins, mitochondrial TSPO and the extracellular ribonuclease T2. If validated, these proteins are of interest as diagnostic biomarkers for LTBI.","Single-cell multi-omics technology is able to measure cells from multiple data modalities. Data integration method aims to integrate cells across data batches and modalities, and learn a comprehensive view of the cells. Data integration can be categorized into horizontal, vertical, diagonal, and mosaic integration, where mosaic integration is the most general and the most challenging case. Most of the existing data integration methods can only work with the first three cases, which constrains their applicability to various data integration tasks. We propose scMoMaT, a method that is able to integrate single cell multi-omics data under the mosaic scenario using matrix tri-factorization. The framework of scMoMaT makes it possible to uncover the cell type specific bio-markers at the same time when learning a unified cell representation. Moreover, scMoMaT can integrate cell batches with unequal cell type composition. Applying scMoMaT to multiple biological datasets shows that scMoMaT has superior performance compared to baseline methods.","Background Major depressive disorder (MDD), schizophrenia (SCZ), and bipolar disorder (BD) have both shared and discrete genetic risk factors and abnormalities in blood-based measures of inflammation and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. The relationships between such genetic architectures and blood-based markers are however unclear. We investigated relationships between polygenic risk scores for these disorders and peripheral biomarkers in the UK Biobank cohort.","Objective To identify pre-diagnostic plasma metabolomic biomarkers associated with risk of exfoliation glaucoma (XFG).","Bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ) presents as a morbid jawbone lesion in patients exposed to a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate (N-BP). Although it is rare, BRONJ has caused apprehension among patients and healthcare providers and decreased acceptance of this anti-resorptive drug class to treat osteoporosis and metastatic osteolysis. We report here a novel method to elucidate the pathological mechanism of BRONJ by the selective removal of legacy N-BP from the jawbone using an intra-oral application of hydroxymethylene diphosphonate (HMDP) formulated in deformable nanoscale vesicles (DNV). After maxillary tooth extraction, zoledronate-treated mice developed delayed gingival wound closure, delayed tooth extraction socket healing and increased jawbone osteonecrosis consistent with human BRONJ lesion. Single cell RNA sequencing of mouse gingival cells revealed oral barrier immune dysregulation and unresolved pro-inflammatory reaction. HMDP-DNV topical applications to nascent mouse BRONJ lesions resulted in accelerated gingival wound closure and bone socket healing as well as attenuation of osteonecrosis development. The gingival single cell RNA sequencing demonstrated resolution of chronic inflammation by increased anti-inflammatory signature gene expression of lymphocytes and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. This study suggests that BRONJ pathology was predominantly induced by the oral N-BP and demonstrates the potential of HMDP-DNV as an effective BRONJ therapy.","BACKGROUND Telomeres are protective cap structures at the end of chromosomes that are essential for maintening genomic stability. Accelerated telomere shortening is related to premature cellular senescence. Shortened telomere lengths (TL) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various chronic immune-mediated and neurological diseases.","Background and Aims Intestinal homeostasis is maintained by specialized host cells and the gut microbiota. Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling is essential for gastrointestinal development and homeostasis, and its dysregulation has been implicated in inflammation and colorectal cancer. Axin1 negatively regulates activated Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling, but little is known regarding its role in regulating host-microbial interactions in health and disease. Here, we aim to demonstrate that intestinal Axin1 determines gut homeostasis and host response to inflammation.","Bacteriophages (phages), Earth\u2019s most numerous biological entities, are natural constituents of alimentary matrices; in this study we describe the characterization of phage populations in a product obtained by fermentation of bovine milk and colostrum. Such characterizations were achieved using a microarray consisting of a chip covered in short DNA sequences that are specific to certain target organisms for a total of approximately 12,000 species. The only viruses evidenced by the array belonged to Siphoviridae, the largest phage family that targets bacteria and archea. The array yielded 27 iterations corresponding to a unique target. We discuss the putative role of some open reading frames of these phages in conferring health-supporting properties with particular reference to cells signaling and neurological development. We also describe the in vitro interaction of this fermented product with alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, an enzyme whose activity in serum is elevated in neurodevelopmental disorders.","Mesenchymal stem cells have been the focus of intense research in bone development and regeneration. We demonstrate the potential of microparticles as modulating moieties of osteogenic response by utilizing their architectural features. Topographically textured microparticles of varying microscale features were produced by exploiting phase-separation of a readily-soluble sacrificial component from polylactic acid. The influence of varying topographical features on primary human mesenchymal stem cell attachment, proliferation and markers of osteogenesis was investigated. In the absence of osteoinductive supplements, cells cultured on textured microparticles exhibited notably increased expression of osteogenic markers relative to conventional smooth microparticles. They also exhibited varying morphological, attachment and proliferation responses. Significantly altered gene expression and metabolic profiles were observed, with varying histological characteristics in vivo. This study highlights how tailoring topographical design offers cell-instructive 3D microenvironments which allow manipulation of stem cell fate by eliciting the desired downstream response without use of exogenous osteoinductive factors.","Objective We aimed to investigate the skeletal phenotype of Winnie mouse model of spontaneous chronic colitis, which carries a mutation in the Muc2 gene and closely replicates IBD symptoms and pathophysiology. These mice have a high level of gut-derived serotonin (GDS), a potent osteoblastogenesis inhibitor. We explored the underlying mechanisms of bone loss associated with chronic intestinal inflammation.","Introduction Obesity is a common disease and a known risk factor for many other conditions such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and cancer. Treatment options for obesity include lifestyle changes, pharmacotherapy, and surgical interventions such as bariatric surgery. In this study, we examine the use of prescription drugs and dietary supplements by the individuals with obesity.","Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as a class of genes whose importance has yet to be fully realized. It is becoming clear that the primary function of lncRNAs is to regulate gene expression, and they do so through a variety of mechanisms that are critically tied to their subcellular localization. Although most lncRNAs are poorly understood, mapping lncRNA subcellular localization can provide a foundation for understanding these mechanisms. Here, we present an initial step toward uncovering the localization landscape of lncRNAs in the human retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) using high throughput RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq). To do this, we differentiated human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into RPE, isolated RNA from nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, and performed RNA-Seq on both. Furthermore, we investigated lncRNA localization changes that occur in response to oxidative stress. We discovered that, under normal conditions, most lncRNAs (76%) are seen in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm to a similar degree, but of the transcripts that are highly enriched in one compartment, more are nuclear (18.6%) than cytoplasmic (5.6%). Interestingly, under oxidative stress conditions, we observed an increase in lncRNA localization in both nuclear (23.5%) and cytoplasmic (9.7%) fractions. In addition, we found that nuclear localization was partially attributable to the presence of previously described nuclear retention motifs, while adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing appeared to play a very minimal role. Our findings regarding lncRNA localization in the RPE provide two avenues for future research: 1) how lncRNAs function in the RPE, and 2) how one environmental factor, in isolation, may play a role in retinal disease pathogenesis.","Background and Objectives Hemodialysis patients are prone to infection with SARS-COV2 and show a high probability of a severe course of disease and high mortality when infected. In many countries hemodialysis patients are prioritised in vaccination programs to protect this vulnerable community. However, no hemodialysis patients were included in efficacy trials of SARS CoV-2 vaccines and therefore efficacy and safety data for this patient group are lacking. These data would be critical, since hemodialysis patients showed decreased responses against various other vaccines and this could mean decreased response to SARS CoV-2 vaccines.","Background Hypocalcaemia has been reported in the context of acute COVID-19, where it has been associated with an increased risk of hospitalisation and disease severity. Calcium is an important intracellular messenger that controls diverse cellular processes. Two other clinically important coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, can use calcium ions to enter and replicate within host cells. Calcium may therefore be important in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 infection. We sought to investigate whether calcium derangement was a specific feature of COVID-19 that distinguishes it from other infective pneumonias, and its association with disease severity.","UV-C processing of whole milk (WM) using a designed pilot scale Dean flow system was conducted at flow rates (11.88, 23.77, and 47.55 gph), Reynolds number ranges from 2890-11562 and the Dean number (at curved region) calculated as (648-2595) to inactivate bacterial endospores and virus particles. Biodosimetry studies were conducted to quantify the reduction equivalent fluence at selected experimental conditions. Results revealed that the fluence distribution improved as flow rate increases, attributed to increase in Dean effects and turbulence intensity. Microbial inactivation studies conducted at 47.55 gph showed 0.91 \u00b1 0.15 and 2.14 \u00b1 0.19 log reduction/ pass for B. cereus endospores and T1UV phage. Linear inactivation trend was observed against number of passes which clearly demonstrates equivalent fluence delivery during each pass. Lipid peroxidation value and volatiles profile did not change significantly at UV fluence of 60 mJ/cm2. Lower EEO value signifies the higher electrical efficiency of the system.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus has infected over 114 million people worldwide as of March 2021, with worldwide mortality rates ranging between 1-10%. We use information on up to 421,111 UK Biobank participants to identify possible predictors for long-term susceptibility to severe COVID-19 infection (N =1,088) and mortality (N =376). We include 36,168 predictors in our analyses and use a gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) algorithm and feature attribution based on Shapley values, together with traditional epidemiological approaches to identify possible risk factors. Our analyses show associations between socio-demographic factors (e.g. age, sex, ethnicity, education, material deprivation, accommodation type) and lifestyle indicators (e.g. smoking, physical activity, walking pace, tea intake, and dietary changes) with risk of developing severe COVID-19 symptoms. Blood (cystatin C, C-reactive protein, gamma glutamyl transferase and alkaline phosphatase) and urine (microalbuminuria) biomarkers measured more than 10 years earlier predicted severe COVID-19. We also confirm increased risks for several pre-existing disease outcomes (e.g. lung diseases, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, circulatory diseases, anemia, and mental disorders). Analyses on mortality were possible within a sub-group testing positive for COVID-19 infection (N =1,953) with our analyses confirming association between age, smoking status, and prior primary diagnosis of urinary tract infection.","Background COVID-19 is a major pandemic that has killed more than 196,000 people. The COVID-19 disease course is strikingly divergent. Approximately 80-85% of patients experience mild or no symptoms, while the remainder develop severe disease. The mechanisms underlying these divergent outcomes are unclear. Emerging health disparities data regarding African American and homeless populations suggest that vitamin D insufficiency (VDI) may be an underlying driver of COVID-19 severity. To better define the VDI-COVID-19 link, we determined the prevalence of VDI among our COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU) patients.","Background Research is ongoing to identify an effective way to prevent or treat COVID-19, but thus far these efforts have not yet identified a possible solution. Prior studies indicate the protective role of Ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation in human health, mediated by vitamin D synthesis. In this study, we empirically outline a negative association of UVB radiation as measured by ultraviolet index (UVI) with the number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 (COVID- 19 deaths).","Respiratory viral pandemics result in large numbers of cases of acute respiratory failure arising from a single etiology, thus reducing the heterogeneity of precepting insult and allowing improved insight into the variation of host responses. In 2009-2011, an influenza pandemic occurred, with pH1N1 infecting millions of people worldwide. Here, we have used novel bioinformatic methods to combine clinical, protein biomarker, and genomic data from patients with influenza-associated acute respiratory failure to identify three mechanistically discrete sub-types with significantly different clinical outcomes. The three endotypes identified can be described as \u201cneutrophil-driven\u201d (16.3%), \u201cadaptive\u201d (51.9%), and \u201cendothelial leak\u201d (31.7%). The neutrophil driven patients display evidence of innate immune activation with associated multi-organ dysfunction and reduced 30-day survival. These patients could be differentiated from the adaptive endotype by an alteration in the GAIT-mechanism, a late transcriptional regulatory response to IFN-\u03b3 that acts to suppress innate immunity by reducing caeruloplasmin mRNA translation. Patients with the neutrophil-driven endotype had significantly increased IFN-\u03b3 levels but appeared unable to suppress their innate immune response. The endothelial leak endotype could be distinguished from both the neutrophil driven and adaptive endotypes by alterations in Slit-Robo signalling, a pathway important in the maintenance of endothelial barrier integrity; Although patients with this endotype required mechanical ventilation, they did not develop multi-organ failure in the manner of the neutrophil-driven endotype patients, and had significantly better clinical outcomes. Importantly, the endotypes identified were stable over 48 hours opening up the possibility of stratified interventional clinical trials in the future.","Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a highly prevalent demyelinating autoimmune condition; the mechanisms regulating its severity and progression are unclear. The IL-17-producing Th17 subset of T cells has been widely implicated in MS and in the mouse model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). However, the differentiation and regulation of Th17 cells during EAE remain incompletely understood. Although evidence is mounting that the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin profoundly affects early T cell differentiation, no studies have looked at its role in longer term T cell responses. Now, we report that cathelicidin drives severe EAE disease. It is released from neutrophils, microglia and endothelial cells throughout disease; its interaction with T cells potentiates Th17 differentiation in lymph nodes and Th17 to exTh17 plasticity and IFN-\u03b3 production in the spinal cord. As a consequence, mice lacking cathelicidin are protected from severe EAE. In addition, we show that cathelicidin is produced by the same cell types in the active brain lesions in human MS disease. We propose that cathelicidin exposure results in highly activated, cytokine-producing T cells which drive autoimmunity; this is a mechanism through which neutrophils amplify inflammation in the central nervous system.","It is known that bipolar disorder and its lithium treatment involve the modulation of oxidative stress. Moreover, it has been observed that lithium\u2019s effects are isotope-dependent. Based on these findings, here we propose that lithium exerts its effects by influencing the recombination dynamics of a naturally occurring radical pair involving oxygen. We develop a simple model inspired by the radical-pair mechanism in cryptochrome in the context of avian magnetoreception and xenon-induced anesthesia. Our model reproduces the observed isotopic dependence in the lithium treatment of hyperactivity in rats. It predicts a magnetic-field dependence of the effectiveness of lithium, which provides one potential experimental test of our hypothesis. Our findings show that Nature might harness quantum entanglement for the brain\u2019s cognitive processes.","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in North, Central, and South America has become the epicenter of the current pandemic. We have suggested previously that the infection rate of this virus might be lower in people living at high altitude (over 2,500 m) compared to that in the lowlands. Based on data from official sources, we performed a new epidemiological analysis of the development of the pandemic in 23 countries on the American continent as of May 23, 2020. Our results confirm our previous finding, further showing that the incidence of COVID-19 on the American continent decreases significantly starting at 1,000 m above sea level (masl). Moreover, epidemiological modeling indicates that the virus transmission rate capacity is lower in the highlands (&gt;1,000 masl) than in the lowlands (&lt;1,000 masl). Finally, evaluating the differences in the recovery percentage of patients, the death-to-case ratio, and the theoretical fraction of undiagnosed cases, we found that the severity of COVID-19 is also decreased above 1,000 m. We conclude that the impact of the COVID-19 decreases significantly with altitude.","Background Human neutrophils are central players in innate immunity, a major component of inflammatory responses, and a leading model for cell motility and chemotaxis. However, primary neutrophils are remarkably short-lived, limiting their experimental usefulness in the laboratory. Thus, human myeloid cell lines have been established and characterized for their ability to undergo neutrophil-like differentiation in vitro. The HL-60 cell line and its PLB-985 sub-line are commonly used as a model for human neutrophil behavior, but how closely gene expression in differentiated cells resembles that of primary neutrophils has remained unclear.","Acute mountain sickness (AMS) is frequently experienced by non-high-altitude natives at high altitudes, which affects the quality of health and productivity of humans. The diagnosis of the disease mainly depends on a self-questionnaire, which reveals our insufficient understanding of AMS and the necessity of developing reliable biomarkers for AMS. In addition to 65 clinical indexes and 22 AMS symptom phenotypes, we profiled the plasma proteomic profiles of AMS via a combination of proximity extension assay with multiple reaction monitoring for a longitudinal cohort of 53 individuals divided into discovery and validation stages. Through differential analysis, machine learning models with high accuracy and protein-symptom-clinical index functional network analysis, we identified proteomic and clinical biomarkers for AMS diagnosis, prognosis, protection, and pathogenesis. RET, a top-weighted protein in the pathogenesis model, showed opposite regulations between individuals with AMS and those without AMS ascending to a high altitude. The downregulation of ADAM15 may play a protective role at high altitude in individuals without AMS. These results suggest that RET and ADAM15 could be promising therapeutic targets for AMS. Moreover, PHGDH and TRAF2 could be candidate predictive and diagnostic biomarkers for AMS, respectively. Additionally, C-peptide was found to be actively involved in the pathogenesis and could aid the assistant diagnosis of AMS. Notably, individuals with AMS showed higher gluconeogenesis activity at the plain than those without AMS. Our findings shed light on the proteomic and clinical biomarkers of AMS, provide a wealth of biological insights into AMS, and thereby promote precision medicine for AMS.","Background The objective of this study was to determine if mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition with or without AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation can protect against primary, age-related OA.","The Australian Imaging and Biomarker Lifestyle (AIBL) study of aging is designed to aid the discovery of biomarkers. The current study aimed to discover differentially expressed plasma proteins that could yield a blood-based screening tool for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. To search for biomarkers and elucidate mechanisms of AD, we immuno-depleted the most abundant plasma proteins and pre-fractionated the remaining proteins by HPLC, prior to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The relative levels of approximately 3,400 protein species resolved on the 2D gels were compared using in-gel differential analysis with spectrally resolved fluorescent protein detection dyes (Zdyes\u2122). Here we report on analysis of pooled plasma samples from an initial screen of a sex-matched cohort of 72 probable AD patients and 72 healthy controls from the baseline time point of AIBL. We report significant changes in variants of apolipoprotein E, haptoglobin, \u03b11 anti-trypsin, inter-\u03b1 trypsin inhibitor, histidine-rich glycoprotein, and a protein of unknown identity. \u03b11 anti-trypsin and \u03b11 anti-chymotrypsin demonstrated plasma concentrations that were dependent on APOE \u03b54 allele dose. Our analysis also identified an association with the level of Vitamin D binding protein fragments and complement factor I with sex. We then conducted a validation study on individual samples using a targeted LC-MS/MS assay. This study indicates that a peripheral protein signature has potential to aid in the characterization of AD. We also found significant associations of protein levels with APOE genotype, indicating that differences in genotype influence the circulating abundances of proteins other than ApoE.","Background The underlying pathogenetic factors generating the innate immune signal necessary for T cell activation, initiation and chronification of Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS, also known as Acne inversa) are still poorly understood. Emerging evidence suggests that defective keratinocyte function critically contributes to HS disease development and progression.","Why have some countries suppressed waves of the COVID-19 pandemic much more effectively than others? We find that the decay rate of daily cases or deaths from peak levels varies by a factor of \u223c40 between countries. This measure of country-level resilience to COVID-19 is positively correlated with trust within society, and with the adaptive increase in stringency of government interventions when epidemic waves occur. All countries where &gt;40% agree \u201cmost people can be trusted\u201d achieve a near complete reduction of new cases and deaths. In contrast, countries where governments maintain greater background stringency tend to be less trusting and less resilient. Building trust is therefore critical to resilience, both to epidemics and other unexpected disruptions, of which COVID-19 is unlikely to be the last.","In this work we tried to study the effect of the regular use of potent mouthwash in COVID19 cases, on the premise that it may speedup the recovery, through the repeated reduction of microbial load, of both, the 2019-nCOV and oral microbiota; thus slowing the disease progression and lowering the incidence of superinfections.","Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are diseases of abnormal hematopoietic differentiation with aberrant epigenetic alterations. Azacitidine (AZA) is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) widely used to treat MDS and AML, yet the impact of AZA on the cell surface proteome has not been defined. To identify potential therapeutic targets for use in combination with AZA in AML patients, we investigated the effects of AZA treatment on four AML cell lines (KG1a, HL60, HNT34, and AML193), representing different stages of differentiation. The effect of AZA treatment on these cell lines was characterized at three levels: the DNA methylome (methylation array), the transcriptome (gene expression array), and the cell surface proteome (glycoprotein capture with SILAC labeling). Untreated AML cell lines showed substantial overlap in their methylomes, transcriptomes, and cell surface proteomes. AZA treatment globally reduced DNA methylation in all cell lines, but changes in the transcriptome and surface proteome were subtle and differed among the cell lines. Transcriptome analysis identified five commonly up-regulated coding genes upon AZA treatment in all four cell lines, TRPM4 being the only gene encoding a surface protein, and surface proteomics analysis found no commonly regulated proteins. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of differentially-regulated RNA and surface proteins showed a decrease in metabolism pathways and an increase in immune defense response pathways. As such, AZA treatment in four AML cell lines had diverse effects at the individual gene and protein level, but converged to regulation of metabolism and immune response at the pathway level. Given the heterogeneous response of AZA in the four cell lines at the gene and protein level, we discuss potential therapeutic strategies for combinations with AZA.","The high mortality rate of gastric cancer (GC) is in part due to the absence of initial disclosure of its biomarkers. The recognition of important genes associated in GC is therefore recommended to advance clinical prognosis, diagnosis and and treatment outcomes. The current investigation used the microarray dataset GSE113255 RNA seq data from the Gene Expression Omnibus database to diagnose differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Pathway and gene ontology enrichment analyses were performed, and a protein\u2011protein interaction network, modules, target genes - miRNA regulatory network and target genes - TF regulatory network were constructed and analyzed. Finally, validation of hub genes was performed.  The 1008 DEGs identified consisted of 505 up regulated genes and 503 down regulated genes. The pathways and GO functions of the up and down regulated genes were mainly enriched in pyrimidine deoxyribonucleosides degradation, extracellular structure organization, allopregnanolone biosynthesis and digestion. FN1, PLK1, ANLN, MCM7, MCM2, EEF1A2, PTGER3, CKB, ERBB4 and PRKAA2 were identified as the most important genes of GC, and validated by TCGA database, The Human Protein Atlas database, receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis and RT-PCR.  Bioinformatics analysis might be useful method to explore the molecular pathogensis of GC. In addition, FN1, PLK1, ANLN, MCM7, MCM2, EEF1A2, PTGER3, CKB, ERBB4 and PRKAA2 might be the most important genes of GC.","Pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived organoids are emerging as novel human-based microphysiological models but display immature phenotypes with limited subsets of endothelial or stromal cells. Here we demonstrate that in vitro manipulation of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in PSC-derived liver organoids selected either through computational analysis or targeted tissue design can advance tissue maturation in vitro. Through an unbiased comparison with the genetic signature of mature livers, we identify downregulated GRNs in fetal liver organoids compared to adult livers. We demonstrate that overexpression of PROX1 and ATF5, together with targeted CRISPR-based transcriptional activation of endogenous CYP3A4, drives maturation in vitro. Single cell analyses reveal hepatobiliary-, endothelial-, and stellate-like cell populations. The engineered organoids demonstrate enhanced vasculogenesis, capture native liver characteristics (e.g. FXR signaling, CYP3A4 activity), and exhibit therapeutic potential in mice. Collectively, our approach provides a genetically guided framework for engineering developmentally advanced multilineage tissues from hiPSCs.","Background and Purpose Immunosuppression is the predominant cause of mortality for sepsis due to failure to eradicate invading pathogens. Unfortunately, no effective and specific drugs capable of reversing immunosuppression are available for clinical use. Increasing evidence implicates vitamin D receptor (VDR) involved in sepsis-induced immunosuppression. Herein, artesunate (AS) was discovered to reverse sepsis-induced immunosuppression and its molecular mechanism is investigated.","Heterotopic ossification (HO), either acquired or hereditary, is featured by ectopic bone formation outside of the normal skeleton. The acquired form of HO is a debilitating and common complication of musculoskeletal trauma, central nervous system injury, burns, combat trauma, hip and elbow fractures, and total joint replacement surgeries. It can be characterized as abnormal bone formation that occurs mostly by endochondral ossification. Recent studies have implicated inflammation and dysregulation of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling as major early contributors to HO formation. Here, we demonstrate that administration of the Hh pathway inhibitor, arsenic trioxide (ATO), prevented acquired HO in a clinically-relevant trauma/burn mouse model. We further evaluated the effects of two additional Hh pathway antagonists: cholecalciferol and pravastatin on mitigating osteoblast differentiation. Finally, we assessed the effect of a combination of Hh pathway inhibitors on reducing systemic proinflammatory responses. A targeted combination approach using Hh pathway inhibitors may offer potential therapeutic benefits though targeting differential components of the Hh pathway. Taken together, our study demonstrates that the administration of single or multiple Hh pathway inhibitors may have the potential to reduce the formation of acquired HO.","Objectives We applied Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate the causal associations of body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) with 19 gastrointestinal (GI) disorders.","Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram-negative opportunistic human pathogen that is highly prevalent in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). A major problem in treating CF patients infected with P. aeruginosa is the development of antibiotic resistance. Therefore, the identification of novel P. aeruginosa antibiotic drug targets is of the upmost urgency. The genome of P. aeruginosa contains four putative cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) of unknown function that have never before been characterized. Analogous to some of the CYPs from M. tuberculosis, the P. aeruginosa CYPs may be important for growth and colonization of the CF patient\u2019s lung. In this study, we cloned, expressed, and characterized CYP168A1 from P. aeruginosa and identified it as a sub-terminal fatty acid hydroxylase. Spectral binding data and computational modeling of substrates and inhibitors suggest that CYP168A1 has a large, expansive active site preferring long chain fatty acids and large hydrophobic inhibitors. Furthermore, metabolism experiments confirm that the enzyme is capable of hydroxylating arachidonic acid, an important inflammatory signaling molecule present in abundance in the CF lung, to 19-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (19-HETE; Km = 41.1 \u00b5M, Vmax = 222 pmol/min/nmol P450), a potent vasoconstrictor which may play a role in the pathogen\u2019s ability to colonize the mammalian lung. Metabolism of arachidonic acid is subject to substrate inhibition and is also inhibited by the presence of ketoconazole. This study points to the discovery of a new potential drug target that may be of utility in treating drug resistant P. aeruginosa.","Context Hepatic iron overload can cause severe organ damage. Therefore, an early diagnosis is crucial, and identification of modifiable risk factors could help to prevent manifestations of iron-driven complications.","Mycobacterium tuberculosis(Mtb) lipoproteins are known to facilitate bacterial survival by manipulating the host immune responses. Here, we have characterized a novel Mtb lipoprotein LprE(LprEMtb), and demonstrated its role in mycobacterial survival. LprEMtb acts by down-regulating the expression of cathelicidin, Cyp27B1, VDR and p38-MAPK via TLR-2 signaling pathway. Deletion of lprEMtb resulted in induction of cathelicidin and decreased survival in the host. Interestingly, LprEMtb was also found to inhibit autophagy mechanism to dampen host immune response. Episomal expression of LprEMtb in non-pathogenic Mycobacterium smegmatis(Msm) increased bacillary persistence by down-regulating the expression of cathelicidin and autophagy, while deletion of LprEMtb orthologue in Msm, had no effect on cathelicidin and autophagy expression. Moreover, LprEMtb blocked phago-lysosome fusion by suppressing the expression of EEA1, Rab7 and LAMP-1 endosomal markers by down-regulating IL-12 and IL-22 cytokines. Our results indicate that LprEMtb plays an important role in mycobacterial pathogenesis in the context of innate immunity.","Background Hemodialyzed patients are at higher risk for COVID-19 and were prioritized in the Portuguese vaccination campaign","Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and associated inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) are caused by rod photoreceptor degeneration, necessitating therapeutics promoting rod photoreceptor survival. To address this, we tested compounds for neuroprotective effects in zebrafish and mouse RP models, reasoning drugs effective across species may translate better clinically. We first performed a large-scale phenotypic drug screen using a larval zebrafish model of inducible RP. 2,934 compounds, mostly human-approved drugs, were tested across six concentrations. Statistically, 113 compounds achieved \u201chit\u201d status. Secondary tests of 42 high-priority hits confirmed eleven lead compounds. Nine leads were then evaluated in mouse RP models, with six exhibiting neuroprotective effects. An analysis of potential mechanisms of action suggested complementary activities. Paired lead compound assays in zebrafish showed additive neuroprotective effects for the majority. These results highlight the value of cross-species phenotypic drug discovery and suggest combinatorial drug therapies may provide enhanced therapeutic benefits for patients with RP and IRDs.","Nutrient availability varies seasonally and spatially in the wild. The resulting nutrient limitation or restricted access to nutrients pose a major challenge for every organism. While many animals, such as hibernating animals, evolved strategies to overcome periods of nutrient scarcity, the cellular mechanisms of these strategies are poorly understood. Cave environments represent an extreme example of nutrient deprived environments since the lack of sunlight and therefore primary energy production drastically diminishes the nutrient availability. Here, we used Astyanax mexicanus, which includes river-dwelling surface fish and cave adapted cavefish populations to study the genetic adaptation to nutrient limitations. We show that cavefish populations store large amounts of fat in different body regions when fed ad libitum in the lab. We found higher expression of lipogenesis genes in cavefish livers when fed the same amount of food as surface fish, suggesting an improved ability of cavefish to use lipogenesis to convert available energy into triglycerides for storage into adipose tissue. Moreover, the lipid metabolism regulator, Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (Ppar\u03b3), is upregulated at both transcript and protein levels in cavefish livers. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP seq) showed that Ppar\u03b3 binds cavefish promoter regions of genes to a higher extent than surface fish. Finally, we identified two possible regulatory mechanisms of Ppar\u03b3 in cavefish: higher amounts of ligands of the nuclear receptor, and nonsense mutations in per2, a known repressor of Ppar\u03b3. Taken together, our study reveals that upregulated Ppar\u03b3 promotes higher levels of lipogenesis in the liver and contributes to higher body fat accumulation in cavefish populations, an important adaptation to nutrient limited environments.","Selection against migrants is key to maintaining genetic differences between populations linked by dispersal. Yet, migrants are not just passively weeded out by selection. Migrants may mitigate fitness costs by proactively choosing among available habitats, or by phenotypic plasticity. We previously reported that a reciprocal transplant of lake and stream stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) found little support for divergent selection. We revisit that experiment to test whether phenotypic plasticity in gene expression may have helped migrants adjust to unfamiliar habitats. We measured gene expression profiles in stickleback via TagSeq and tested whether migrants between lake and stream habitats exhibited a plastic response to their new environment that allowed them to converge on the expression profile of adapted natives. We report extensive gene expression differences between genetically divergent lake and stream stickleback, despite gene flow. But for many genes, expression was highly plastic. Fish transplanted into the adjoining habitat partially converged on the expression profile typical of their new habitat. This suggests that expression plasticity may soften the impact of migration. Nonetheless, lake and stream fish differed in survival rates and parasite infection rates in our study, implying that expression plasticity is not fast or extensive enough to fully homogenize fish performance.","Intravenous leiomyomatosis (IVLM) is a rare benign smooth muscle tumour that is characterised by intravenous growth in the uterine and pelvic veins. Previous DNA copy number and transcriptomic studies have shown that IVLM harbours unique genomic and transcriptomic alterations when compared to uterine leiomyoma (uLM), which may account for their distinct clinical behaviour. Here we undertake the first comparative proteomic analysis of IVLM and other smooth muscle tumours (comprising uLM, soft tissue leiomyoma and benign metastasising leiomyoma) utilising data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry. We show that, at the protein level, IVLM is defined by the unique co-regulated expression of splicing factors. In particular, IVLM is enriched in two clusters composed of co-regulated proteins from the hnRNP, LSm, SR and Sm classes of the spliceosome complex. One of these clusters (Cluster 3) is associated with key biological processes including nascent protein translocation and cell signalling by small GTPases. Taken together, our study provides evidence of co-regulated expression of splicing factors in IVLM compared to other smooth muscle tumours which suggests a possible role for alternative splicing in the pathogenesis of IVLM.","Determinant factors which contribute to the prediction should take into account multivariate analysis for capturing coarse-to-fine contextual information. From the preliminary descriptive analysis, it shows that environmental factor such as UV (ultraviolet) is one of the essential factors that should be considered to observe the COVID-19 epidemic drivers, During summer, UV can inactivate viruses that live in the air and on the surface of the objects especially at noon in tropical or subtropical countries. However, it may not be significant in closed spaces like workspace and areas with the intensive human-to-human transmission, especially in densely populated areas. Different COVID-19 pandemic growth patterns in northern subtropical, southern subtropical and tropical countries occur over time. Moreover, there are education, government, morphological, health, economic, and behavioral factors contributing to the growth of COVID-19. Multivariate analysis via visual attribution of explainable Convolution-LSTM is utilized to see high contributing factors responsible for the growth of daily COVID-19 cases. For future works, data to be analyzed should be more detailed in terms of the region and the period where the time-series sample is acquired. The explainable Convolution-LSTM code is available here: https://github.com/cbasemaster/time-series-attribution","Bile acids (BAs) comprise heterogenous amphipathic cholesterol-derived molecules that carry out physicochemical and signaling functions. A major site of BA action is the terminal ileum, where enterocytes actively reuptake BAs and express high levels of BA-sensitive nuclear receptors. BA pool size and composition are affected by changes in metabolic health, and vice versa. One of several factors that differentiate BAs is the presence of a hydroxyl group on C12 of the steroid ring. 12a-hydroxylated BAs (12HBAs) are altered in multiple disease settings, but the consequences of 12HBA abundance are incompletely understood. We employed mouse primary ileum organoids to investigate the transcriptional effects of varying 12HBA abundance in BA pools. We identified Slc30a10 as one of the top genes differentially induced by BA pools with varying 12HBA abundance. SLC30A10 is a manganese (Mn) efflux transporter critical for whole-body manganese excretion. We found that BA pools, especially those low in 12HBAs, induce cellular manganese efflux, and that Slc30a10 induction by BA pools is driven primarily by lithocholic acid signaling via the vitamin D receptor. Administration of lithocholic acid or a vitamin D receptor agonist resulted in increased Slc30a10 expression in mouse ileum epithelia. These data demonstrate a previously unknown role for BAs in intestinal control of Mn homeostasis.","The microbial communities that inhabit the distal gut of humans and other mammals exhibit large inter-individual variation. While host genetics is a known factor that influences gut microbiota composition, the mechanisms underlying this variation remain largely unknown. Bile acids (BAs) are hormones that are produced by the host and chemically modified by gut bacteria. BAs serve as environmental cues and nutrients to microbes, but they can also have antibacterial effects. We hypothesized that host genetic variation in BA metabolism and homeostasis influence gut microbiota composition. To address this, we used the Diversity Outbred (DO) stock, a population of genetically distinct mice derived from eight founder strains. We characterized the fecal microbiota composition and plasma and cecal BA profiles from 400 DO mice maintained on a high-fat high-sucrose diet for \u223c22 weeks. Using quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis, we identified several genomic regions associated with variations in both bacterial and BA profiles. Notably, we found overlapping QTL for Turicibacter sp. and plasma cholic acid, which mapped to a locus containing the gene for the ileal bile acid transporter, Slc10a2. Mediation analysis and subsequent follow-up validation experiments suggest that differences in Slc10a2 gene expression associated with the different strains influences levels of both traits and revealed novel interactions between Turicibacter and BAs. This work illustrates how systems genetics can be utilized to generate testable hypotheses and provide insight into host-microbe interactions.","Background New biomarkers of risk may improve breast cancer risk prediction. We developed a computational pathology method to segment benign breast disease (BBD) whole slide images (WSIs) into epithelium, fibrous stroma, and fat. We applied our method to the BBD breast cancer nested case-control study within the Nurses\u2019 Health Studies to assess whether computer-derived tissue composition or a morphometric signature was associated with subsequent risk of breast cancer.","The primary target of Influenza A virus (IAV) is epithelial cells in the respiratory tract. In contrast to epithelial cells, productive infection of most IAV strains is either blocked or highly inefficient in macrophages. The exact nature of the defect in IAV replication in human macrophages remains unknown. In this study, we showed that primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) are inefficient in IAV release even when compared to a monocytic cell line differentiated to macrophage-like cells, despite comparable levels of expression of viral glycoproteins at the plasma membrane. Correlative fluorescence scanning electron microscopy revealed that formation of budding structures at the cell surface is inefficient in MDM even though clustering of a viral glycoprotein, hemagglutinin (HA), is observed, suggesting that IAV particle assembly is blocked in human MDM. Using an in situ proximity ligation assay, we further determined that association between HA and the viral ion channel protein M2 is defective at the plasma membrane of MDM. In contrast, HA and another glycoprotein neuraminidase (NA) associate with each other on the MDM surface efficiently. Notably, the defect in association between HA and M2 in MDM was reversed upon inhibition of actin polymerization by cytochalasin D. Altogether, these results suggest that HA-M2 association on the plasma membrane is a discrete step in the IAV assembly process, which is separable from the association between HA and NA and susceptible to suppression by actin cytoskeleton. Overall, our study revealed the presence of a cell-type-specific mechanism negatively regulating IAV assembly at the plasma membrane.","We constructed a lung cancer-specific database housing expression data and clinical data from over 6,700 patients in 56 studies. Expression data from 23 \u201cwhole-genome\u201d based platforms were carefully processed and quality controlled, whereas clinical data were standardized and rigorously curated. Empowered by this lung cancer database, we created an open access web resource \u2013 the Lung Cancer Explorer (LCE), which enables researchers and clinicians to explore these data and perform analyses. Users can perform meta-analyses on LCE to gain a quick overview of the results on tumor vs normal differential gene expression and expression-survival association. Individual dataset-based survival analysis, comparative analysis, and correlation analysis are also provided with flexible options to allow for customized analyses from the user.","  Pooling biomarker data across multiple studies enables researchers to get\nmore precise estimates of the association between biomarker exposure\nmeasurements and disease risks due to increased sample sizes. However,\nbiomarker measurements vary significantly across different assays and\nlaboratories, and therefore calibration of the local laboratory measurements to\na reference laboratory is necessary before pooling data. We propose two methods\nthat can estimate a nonlinear relationship between biomarker exposure\nmeasurements and disease risks using spline functions with a nested\ncase-control study design: full calibration and internalized calibration. The\nfull calibration method calibrates all observations using a study-specific\ncalibration model while the internalized calibration method only calibrates\nobservations that do not have reference laboratory measurements available. We\ncompare the two methods with a naive method whereby data are pooled without\ncalibration. We find that: (1) Internalized and full calibration methods have\nsubstantially better performance than the naive method in terms of average\nrelative bias and coverage rate. (2) Full calibration is more robust than\ninternalized calibration when the size of calibration subsets varies. We apply\nour methods to a pooling project with nested case-control study design to\nestimate the association of circulating Vitamin D levels with the risk of\ncolorectal cancer.\n","Accumulating evidence supports involvement of innate immunity in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Monocytes are a highly heterogeneous population, subcategorized into classical (CD14++CD16\u2212), intermediate (CD14++CD16+) and nonclassical subsets (CD14+CD16++). How monocytic subsets may shape brain structures and functions remains unclear. The primary goal of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the inter-relationships among monocytic subsets and their specific transcriptomic profiles, cerebral cortical thickness, and cognitive functions in first-episode schizophrenia (FES) patients. We performed whole-blood RNA sequencing (RNAseq) in 128 FES patients and 111 healthy controls (HCs) along with MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) measurement, as well as neuroimaging and flow cytometry among partial participants. RNAseq revealed significantly changed expressions of 54 monocytic signature genes in FES patients compared to HCs, especially for intermediate and nonclassical monocytic subsets, with the most outstanding alterations being downregulated S100 Calcium Binding Protein A (S100A) and upregulated Interferon Induced Transmembrane Protein (IFITM) family members, respectively. The percentage of nonclassical monocytes was decreased in FES patients. Cortical thicknesses and MCCB performance were expectantly reduced in FES patients too. Interestingly, negative inter-relationships of monocytic signature genes with both cortical thicknesses and cognition were found in HCs, which were weakened or even reversed in FES patients. Furthermore, the lateral occipital cortex fully mediated the negative effect of a classical monocytic gene Ribonuclease A Family Member 2 (RNASE2) on visual learning in patient group. This study suggests that monocytic dysfunctions play an essential role in cognitive deficit of schizophrenia, and their subtypes should be considered in future research.","We present a systematic assessment of polygenic risk score (PRS) prediction across more than 1,500 traits using genetic and phenotype data in the UK Biobank. We report 813 sparse PRS models with significant (p &lt; 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22125) incremental predictive performance when compared against the covariate-only model that considers age, sex, types of genotyping arrays, and the principal component loadings of genotypes. We report a significant correlation between the number of genetic variants selected in the sparse PRS model and the incremental predictive performance (Spearman\u2019s \u03c1 = 0.61, p = 2.2 \u00d7 10\u221259 for quantitative traits, \u03c1 = 0.21, p = 9.6 \u00d7 10\u22124 for binary traits). The sparse PRS model trained on European individuals showed limited transferability when evaluated on non-European individuals in the UK Biobank. We provide the PRS model weights on the Global Biobank Engine (https://biobankengine.stanford.edu/prs).","Background MC1R, a G-protein coupled receptor with high affinity for alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (\u03b1MSH), modulates pigment production in melanocytes from many species and is associated with human melanoma risk. MC1R mutations affecting human skin and hair color also have pleiotropic effects on the immune response and analgesia. Variants affecting human pigmentation in utero alter the congenital phenotype of both oculocutaneous albinism and congenital melanocytic naevi, and have a possible effect on birthweight.","Motivated by earlier findings that exposure to daily outdoor PM2.5 (P) may increase the risk of influenza infection, our study examines if immediate exposure to outdoor P will modify the rate of change in the daily number of COVID-19 infections (R), for (1) the high infection provincial capital cities in China and (2) Wuhan, China, using regression modelling. A multiple linear regression model was constructed to model the statistical relationship between P and R in China and in Wuhan, from 1 January to 20 March 2020. We carefully accounted for potential key confounders and addressed collinearity. The causal relationship between P and R, and the interaction effect between key variables were investigated. A causal relationship between P and R across the high infection provincial capital cities in China was established via matching. A higher P resulted in a higher R in China. A 10 \u00b5g/m3 increase in P gave a 1.5% increase in R (p &lt; 0.001). An interaction analysis between P and absolute humidity (AH) showed a statistically significant negative relationship between P \u00d7 AH and R (p &lt; 0.05). When AH was $ 5.8 g/m3, a higher P and AH gave a higher R. In contrast, when AH \u2265 5.8 g/m3, the effect of a higher P was counteracted by the effect of a higher AH, resulting in a lower R. Given that P can exacerbate R, we recommend the installation of air purifiers and better air ventilation to reduce the effect of P on R. Further, given the increasing discussions/observations that COVID-19 can be airborne, we highly recommend the wearing of surgical masks to keep one from contracting COVID-19 via the viral-particulate transmission pathway.","Bone remodeling involves the coordinated actions of osteoclasts, which resorb the calcified bony matrix, and osteoblasts, which refill erosion pits created by osteoclasts to restore skeletal integrity and adapt to changes in mechanical load. Osteoblasts are derived from pluripotent mesenchymal stem cell precursors, which undergo differentiation under the influence of a host of local and environmental cues. To characterize the autocrine/paracrine signaling networks associated with osteoblast maturation and function, we performed gene network analysis using complementary \u201cagnostic\u201d DNA microarray and \u201ctargeted\u201d NanoString\u2122 nCounter datasets derived from murine MC3T3-E1 cells induced to undergo synchronized osteoblastic differentiation in vitro. Pairwise datasets representing changes in gene expression associated with growth arrest (day 2 to 5 in culture), differentiation (day 5 to 10 in culture), and osteoblast maturation (day 10 to 28 in culture) were analyzed using Ingenuity Systems\u2122 Pathways Analysis to generate predictions about signaling pathway activity based on the temporal sequence of changes in target gene expression. Our data indicate that some pathways known to be involved in osteoblast differentiation, e.g. Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling, are most active early in the process, while others, e.g. TGF\u03b2/BMP, cytokine/JAK-STAT and TNF\u03b1/RANKL signaling, increase in activity as differentiation progresses. Collectively, these pathways contribute to the sequential expression of genes involved in the synthesis and mineralization of extracellular matrix. These results provide insight into the temporal coordination and complex interplay between signaling networks controlling gene expression during osteoblast differentiation. A more complete understanding of these processes may aid the discovery of novel methods to promote osteoblast development for the trea\u2122ent of conditions characterized by low bone mineral density.","Strategies have not been available until recently to uncover interacting protein networks specific to key cell types, their subcellular compartments, and their major regulators during complex in vivo events. Here we apply BioID2 proximity labeling to capture protein networks acting within cardiomyocytes during a key model of innate heart regeneration in zebrafish. Transgenic zebrafish expressing a promiscuous BirA2 localized to the entire myocardial cell or membrane compartment were generated, each identifying unique proteomes in adult cardiomyocytes that became altered during regeneration. BioID2 profiling for interactors with ErbB2, a co-receptor for the cardiomyocyte mitogen Nrg1, implicated Rho A as a target of ErbB2 signaling in cardiomyocytes. Blockade of Rho A during heart regeneration, or during cardiogenic stimulation by the mitogenic influences Nrg1, Vegfaa or Vitamin D, disrupted muscle creation. Our findings reveal proximity labeling as a useful resource to interrogate cell proteomes and signaling networks during tissue regeneration in zebrafish.","Mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein mediates innate antiviral responses, including responses to certain coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). We have previously shown that ultraviolet-A (UVA) therapy can prevent virus-induced cell death in human ciliated tracheal epithelial cells (HTEpC) infected with coronavirus-229E, and that UVA treatment results in an increase in intracellular levels of MAVS. In this study, we set out to determine the mechanisms by which UVA light can activate MAVS, and whether local UVA light application can activate MAVS at locations distant from the light source (such as via cell-to-cell communication). MAVS levels were compared in HTEpC exposed to 2 mW/cm2 narrow band (NB)-UVA for 20 minutes and in unexposed controls, at 30-40% and at 100% confluency. MAVS levels were also compared in unexposed HTEpC treated with supernatants or lysates from UVA-exposed cells or from unexposed controls. Also, MAVS was assessed in different sections of confluent monolayer plates where only one section was exposed to NB-UVA. The results show that UVA increases the expression of MAVS protein. Cells in a confluent monolayer exposed to UVA were able to confer an elevation in MAVS in cells adjacent to the exposed section, and even cells in the most distant sections not exposed to UVA. In this study, human ciliated tracheal epithelial cells exposed to UVA demonstrate increased MAVS protein, and also appear to transmit this influence to distant confluent cells not exposed to light.","We use UK Biobank data to train predictors for 48 blood and urine markers such as HDL, LDL, lipoprotein A, glycated haemoglobin, \u2026 from SNP genotype. For example, our predictor correlates \u223c 0.76 with lipoprotein A level, which is highly heritable and an independent risk factor for heart disease. This may be the most accurate genomic prediction of a quantitative trait that has yet been produced (specifically, for European ancestry groups). We also train predictors of common disease risk using blood and urine biomarkers alone (no DNA information). Individuals who are at high risk (e.g., odds ratio of &gt; 5x population average) can be identified for conditions such as coronary artery disease (AUC \u223c 0.75), diabetes (AUC \u223c 0.95), hypertension, liver and kidney problems, and cancer using biomarkers alone. Our atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) predictor uses \u223c 10 biomarkers and performs in UKB evaluation as well as or better than the American College of Cardiology ASCVD Risk Estimator, which uses quite different inputs (age, diagnostic history, BMI, smoking status, statin usage, etc.). We compare polygenic risk scores (risk conditional on genotype: (risk score | SNPs)) for common diseases to the risk predictors which result from the concatenation of learned functions (risk score | biomarkers) and (biomarker | SNPs).","Nutritional intake impacts the human epigenome by directing epigenetic pathways in normal cell development via as yet unknown molecular mechanisms. Consequently, imbalance in the nutritional intake is able to dysregulate the epigenetic profile and drive cells towards malignant transformation. Herein, we present a novel epigenetic effect of the essential nutrient, NAD. We demonstrate that impairment of DNMT1 enzymatic activity by NAD-promoted ADP-ribosylation, leads to demethylation and transcriptional activation of CEBPA gene, suggesting the existence of an unknown NAD-controlled region within the locus. In addition to the molecular events, NAD treated cells exhibit significant morphological and phenotypical changes that correspond to myeloid differentiation.","Hemodialysis patients (HD patients) have a high health risk from Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. In this study, we assess the impact of a third vaccine dose (3D) on antibody levels and T cell response in HD patients and compare the results to those of a healthy control group.","Diet is a modifiable, non-invasive, inexpensive behavior that is crucial in shaping the intestinal microbiome. A microbiome \u201cimbalance\u201d or dysbiosis in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is linked to inflammation. Here, we aim to define the impact of specific foods on bacterial species commonly depleted in patients with IBD to better inform dietary treatment. We performed a single-arm, pre-post intervention trial. After a baseline period, a dietary intervention with the IBD-Anti-Inflammatory Diet (IBD-AID) was initiated. We collected stool and blood samples and assessed dietary intake throughout the study. We applied advanced computational approaches to define and model complex interactions between the foods reported and the microbiome. A dense dataset comprising 553 dietary records and 340 stool samples was obtained from 22 participants. Consumption of prebiotics, probiotics, and beneficial foods correlated with increased abundance of Clostridia and Bacteroides, commonly depleted in IBD cohorts. We further show that the IBD-AID intervention affects the immune tone by lowering IL-8 and increasing GM-CSF with certain foods correlating with levels of those cytokines. By using robust predictive analytics, this study represents the first steps to detangle diet-microbiome interactions to inform personalized nutrition for patients suffering from dysbiosis-related IBD.","A decline in skeletal muscle mitochondrial function is associated with the loss of skeletal muscle size and function during knee osteoarthritis (OA). We have recently reported that the 12-weeks of dietary rapamycin (Rap, 14ppm), with or without metformin (Met, 1000ppm), increased plasma glucose and OA severity in male Dunkin Hartley (DH) guinea pigs, a model of naturally occurring, age-related OA. The purpose of the current study was to determine if increased OA severity after dietary Rap and Rap+Met was accompanied by impaired skeletal muscle mitochondrial function. Mitochondrial respiration and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) emissions were evaluated in permeabilized muscle fibers via high-resolution respirometry and fluorometry using either a saturating bolus or titration of ADP. Rap and Rap+Met decreased complex I (CI)-linked respiration and increased ADP sensitivity, consistent with previous findings in patients with end-stage OA. Rap also tended to decrease mitochondrial H2O2 emissions, however, this was no longer apparent after normalizing to respiration. The decrease in CI-linked respiration was accompanied with lower CI protein abundance. This is the first inquiry into how lifespan extending treatments Rap and Rap+Met can influence skeletal muscle mitochondria in a model of age-related OA. Collectively, our data suggest that Rap with or without Met inhibits CI-linked capacity and increases ADP sensitivity in DH guinea pigs that have greater OA severity.","Objective Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory condition that predominantly affects the skin and is associated with extracutaneous disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease and arthritis. Changes in gut immunology and microbiota are important drivers of proinflammatory disorders and could play a role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Therefore, we explored whether psoriasis in a Central Asian cohort is associated with alterations in select immunological markers and/or microbiota of the gut.","Neophobia, the fear of novelty, is an ecologically important response which enables animals to avoid potentially harmful situations. Low levels of neophobia have been linked to elevated dispersal/ migration, invasiveness and living in human modified landscapes albeit only in birds and mammals. In this study, we assessed neophobia in captive Tokay geckos (Gekko gecko). We expected to find low neophobia in our geckos because they are invasive and adopt well to anthropogenic environments. This species is, however, also both predator and prey in the wild which might select for higher neophobia. We tested neophobia in three contexts: attacking novel prey, foraging near novel objects and entering a novel space. We aimed to quantify (1) neophobia in these contexts, (2) individual consistency across trials using different novel stimuli, and (3) correlation of individual responses across the three contexts. We found that geckos hesitate to attack novel prey and prey close to objects (familiar and novel). Geckos hesitated the most when entering novel space and repeatability of behaviour across contexts was low (R = 0.12) indicating that neophobia might not be a single trait. The strength of a neophobic response can indicate how anxious or curious an individual is. This test has great potential to help answer questions about how captivity, enrichment, rearing environment and cognition affect fear responses in different contexts in lizards. By studying reptiles, we can better understand the universality of what is known about the causes leading to difference in neophobia across individuals and species.","Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic auto-immune, inflammatory, and degenerative disease of the central nervous system, affects both males and females; however, females suffer from a higher risk of developing MS (2-3:1 ratio compared to males). Current knowledge does not allow a precise definition of the sex-based factors influencing MS. Here, we explore the role of sex in MS to identify potential molecular mechanisms underlying sex-based differences that may guide novel therapeutic approaches tailored for males or females.  \n\nMethods: We performed a rigorous and systematic review of whole transcriptome studies of MS that included patient information regarding sex in Gene Expression Omnibus and ArrayExpress databases following PRISMA statement guidelines. We analyzed differential gene expression for each selected study and addressed 3 meta-analyses based on genes to evaluate common features and sex bias: the first meta-analysis of 4 nervous tissue studies, a second in 5 blood studies, and a third integrating 9 studies from both tissues. Finally, we performed a gene set analysis on the meta-analyzed differential transcriptomic profiles of the nervous system to study sex-based differences in biological pathways and phenotypes (physiological and pathological states).  \n\nResults: After screening 122 publications, the systematic review provided a selection of 9 studies (5 in blood and 4 in nervous tissue) with a total of 474 samples (189 MS females and 109 control females; 82 MS males and 94 control males). The tissue-specific meta-analysis identified the overexpression of KIR2DL3 in blood in females and 13 genes with a sex-based differential expression pattern in the nervous system (7 overexpressed in females: ARL17B, CECR7, CEP78, STMP1, TRAF3IP2-AS1, ZNF117 and ZNF488; and 6 overexpressed in males: IFFO2, LOC401127, NUDT18, RNF10, SLC17A5, and UBXN2B). The two-tissue meta-analysis detected a single gene overexpressed in females (LOC102723701). Functional analyses revealed different altered immune scenarios in females and males. A pro-inflammatory environment and innate immune responses related to myeloid linage predominate in females, while in males, adaptative responses associated with the lymphocyte linage. Additionally, MS females displayed alterations in mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, purine, and glutamate metabolism, while MS males displayed alterations in stress response to metal ion, amine, and amino acid transport.  \n\nConclusion: We found transcriptomic and functional differences between MS males and females (especially in the immune system), which may support the development of sex-specific treatments. Our study highlights the importance of understanding sex as a variable in MS.","Background Hip fracture (HF) requires an intensive healthcare resources utilization. Long-term morbidity related to poor fracture management is associated with a significant increase in healthcare costs. Many factors may affect the costs and outcomes in patients with HF. Using a definition of integrated Continuum-Care Episode (CCE) that encompasses the hospital phase and the post-acute rehabilitation after a surgical procedure for HF, we investigated the costs of CCEs for HF and their determinants, with particular regard to the contribution of different rehabilitation settings.","Diabetes mellitus is a global and one of the most common healthcare problems. The immune system, having a certain autonomy in the recognition and removal of foreign cells, antigens and other compounds is also under strict homeostatic control, in which a lot of/ variety of biochemical reactions take part. And since the problem of treatment of diabetes mellitus is still not solved, it requires detailed research of different elements of pathogenesis at the molecular level. Taking into account the fact that the connection/ link between immune processes and enzymes of purine metabolism is doubtless, it is of interest to investigate the changes in purine metabolism. In previous studies a frequent combination and interrelation of purine and carbohydrate metabolism was shown. Aim of this study was the investigation of the enzymatic activity of PNP in serum, liver and in pancreas, and also determination of levels of lipid peroxidation indicators, NO content in blood plasma, glutathione peroxidase activity in the mitochondrial fraction of the pancreatic tissue of white rats with modeled alloxan diabetes. The obtained results have demonstrated statistically significant changes in the PNP activity level indicators in the investigated organs and stages of the disease. The indicators of oxidative processes MDA, NO and changes of the activity of GPx and PNP can be used as additional paraclinical indicators for early diagnostics and for detection and refinement of the level of activity of the pathologic process, its development and stage of the disease, which contributes to the appointment of individualized adequate therapy.","Ubiquitin ligases (E3s) embedded in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane regulate essential cellular activities including protein quality control, calcium flux, and sterol homeostasis. At least 25 different, transmembrane domain (TMD)-containing E3s are predicted to be ER-localised, but for most their organisation and cellular roles remain poorly defined. Using a comparative proteomic workflow, we mapped over 450 protein-protein interactions for 21 different stably expressed, full-length E3s. Bioinformatic analysis linked ER-E3s and their interactors to multiple homeostatic, regulatory, and metabolic pathways. Among these were four membrane-embedded interactors of RNF26, a polytopic E3 whose abundance is auto-regulated by ubiquitin-proteasome dependent degradation. RNF26 co-assembles with TMEM43, ENDOD1, TMEM33 and TMED1 to form a complex capable of modulating innate immune signalling through the cGAS-STING pathway. This RNF26 complex represents a new modulatory axis of STING and innate immune signalling at the ER membrane. Collectively, these data reveal the broad scope of regulation and differential functionalities mediated by ER-E3s for both membrane-tethered and cytoplasmic processes.","Introduction Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are at risk for a variety of severe debilitating effects. One of the most serious complications experienced by T2DM patients are skeletal diseases caused by changes in the bone microenvironment. As a result, T2DM patients are at risk for higher prevalence of fragility fractures.","A later age at natural menopause (ANM) has been linked to several aging-associated traits including an increased risk of breast and endometrial cancer as well as a decreased risk of lung cancer, osteoporosis, and Alzheimer disease. However, ANM is also related to a number of socioeconomic, lifestyle, dietary factors, and other proxies for overall health that may confound these associations. We investigated the causal association of ANM with these clinical outcomes using the principles of Mendelian randomization (MR) combined with a study design that ensured that all participants and outcomes analyzed were restricted to post-menopausal females. We first confirmed associations in the direction expected through observational analysis in both the Women\u2019s Health Initiative (WHI) and the UK Biobank (UKB) before conducting a one-sample MR analysis in these same two cohorts. We further analyzed and integrated several additional datasets of post-menopausal women using a two-sample MR design. We used up to 55 genetic variants previously discovered to be associated with ANM as our instrumental variable. We found that a five year increase in ANM was causally associated with a decreased risk of osteoporosis (OR=0.81 [0.69, 0.95]) and fractures (OR=0.73 [0.60, 0.88]) as well as an increased risk of lung cancer (OR=1.34 [1.05, 1.71]). Other associations including atherosclerosis related outcomes were null. Our study confirms that the known decline in bone density with menopause causally translates to the clinical outcomes of fracture and diagnosed osteoporosis. Additionally, this is the first causal epidemiologic analysis to our knowledge to find an increased risk of lung cancer with ANM. This increased risk is consistent with both molecular and clinical epidemiologic studies that suggest that growth of lung tumors may be in part dependent on estrogen. Randomized controlled trials to test for a beneficial effect of anti-estrogen therapies in the prevention or treatment of lung cancer should be considered if additional MR studies are confirmatory.","Improved understanding of the effects of meteorological conditions on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent for COVID-19 disease, is urgently needed to inform mitigation efforts. Here, we estimated the relationship between air temperature or specific humidity (SH) and SARS-CoV-2 transmission in 913 U.S. counties with abundant reported infections from March 15 to August 31, 2020. Specifically, we quantified the associations of daily mean temperature and SH with daily estimates of the SARS-CoV-2 reproduction number (Rt) and calculated the fraction of Rt attributable to these meteorological conditions. Both lower temperature and lower SH were significantly associated with increased Rt. The fraction of Rt attributable to temperature was 5.10% (95% eCI: 5.00 - 5.18%), and the fraction of Rt attributable to SH was 14.47% (95% eCI: 14.37 - 14.54%). These fractions generally were higher in northern counties than in southern counties. Our findings indicate that cold and dry weather are moderately associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility, with humidity playing a larger role than temperature.","Background In treatment naive Indian cancer patients, prevalence of iron, B12 deficiency and inflammatory anaemia in poorly known.","The circulating metabolome is a product of interactions between the genome, epigenome, exposome and microbiome. The metabolome may be altered in people with multiple sclerosis (MS); however, existing metabolomics studies were relatively small or characterized a limited number of metabolites. Herein, we performed a multi-site study profiling the circulating metabolome to obtain relative abundances for 269 metabolites in a large cohort of MS patients and healthy controls. After adjusting for batch effects and extensive quality control, we created an overall metabolic dysfunction score, defined apriori sets of metabolites using known metabolic pathways, and derived novel networks of correlated metabolites using a weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA). We assessed whether metabolic dysfunction, individual metabolites, metabolic pathways or WGCNA-identified module scores differed between people with MS versus healthy controls (HC) after adjusting for age, sex and race using generalized estimating equations (participants could provide multiple samples). In a subset of patients, information on disability status was also available. Similar models assessed the association between metabolites and metabolite sets with measures of disability. In people with MS, we identified striking abnormalities in a WGCNA-defined module enriched in aromatic amino acid (AAA) metabolites (FDR-adjusted p-value=2.77E-18) that are also strongly associated with disability (FDR-adjusted p-value for AAA module=1.01E-4). Consistent results were obtained using apriori-defined metabolite sets or in analyses of individual metabolites. The identified abnormalities likely relate to imbalances in gut microbial metabolism of AAAs resulting in reduced production of immunomodulatory metabolites and increased production of metabotoxins (indole acetate, phenylacetylglutamine, p-cresol sulfate, p-cresol glucuronide). Single cell RNA sequencing data analysis demonstrated altered AAA metabolism in CSF and blood derived monocyte cell populations, while treatment of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells with AAA-derived metabotoxins resulted in increased production of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1. We identify novel metabolic alterations in people with MS potentially contributing to disease pathophysiology.","The 10K is a large-scale prospective longitudinal cohort and biobank that was established in Israel. The primary aims of the study include development of prediction models for disease onset and progression and identification of novel molecular markers with a diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic value. The recruitment was initiated in 2018 and is expected to complete in 2021. Between 28/01/2019 and 13/12/2020, 4,629 from the expected 10,000 participants were recruited (46%). Follow-up visits are scheduled every year for a total of 25 years. The cohort includes individuals between the age of 40 and 70 years old. Predefined medical conditions were determined as exclusions. Information collected at baseline includes medical history, lifestyle and nutritional habits, vital signs, anthropometrics, blood tests results, Electrocardiography (ECG), Ankle\u2013brachial pressure index (ABI), liver US and Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) tests. Molecular profiling includes transcriptome, proteome, gut and oral microbiome, metabolome and immune system profiling. Continuous measurements include glucose levels using a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device for 2 weeks and sleep monitoring by a home sleep apnea test (HSAT) device for 3 nights. Blood and stool samples are collected and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C in a storage facility for future research. Linkage is being established with national disease registries.","Background In a tertiary respiratory centre, large cohorts of patients are managed in an outpatient setting and require blood tests to monitor disease activity and organ toxicity. This requires either visits to tertiary centres for phlebotomy and physician review or utilisation of primary care services.","Introduction Approval for the use of COVID-19 vaccines has been granted in a number of countries but there are concerns that vaccine uptake may be low amongst certain groups.","Aims Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a pregnancy-specific disorder that can usually be diagnosed after 24 gestational weeks. So far, there is no accurate method to predict GDM in early pregnancy.","Background Physician Global Assessment (PGA) is a visual analogue score (VAS) that reflects the clinician\u2019s judgment of overall Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) disease activity. The aim of this systematic literature review (SLR) is to describe and analyse the psychometric properties of PGA.","Introduction Although there are case reports and guideline recommendations that states omalizumab can be used in chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) patients during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, there are scarce studies showing the course of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in CSU patients receiving omalizumab.","IMPORTANCE Ocular complications in infants with Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS) have been reported. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying of eye dysfunctions are presently unknown.","Background COVID-19 comprises several severity stages ranging from oligosymptomatic disease to multi-organ failure and fatal outcomes. The mechanisms why COVID-19 is a mild disease in some patients and progresses to a severe multi-organ and often fatal disease with respiratory failure are not known. Biomarkers that predict the course of disease are urgently needed. The aim of this study was to evaluate a large spectrum of established laboratory measurements.","Background After ischemic stroke (IS), peripheral leukocytes infiltrate the damaged region and modulate the response to injury. Peripheral blood cells display distinctive gene expression signatures post IS and these transcriptional programs reflect changes in immune responses to IS. Dissecting the temporal dynamics of gene expression after IS improves our understanding of immune and clotting responses at the molecular and cellular level that are involved in acute brain injury and may assist with time-targeted, cell-specific therapy.","","Granulomas are complex cellular structures comprised predominantly of macrophages and lymphocytes that function to contain and kill invading pathogens. Here, we investigated single cell phenotypes associated with antimicrobial responses in human leprosy granulomas by applying single cell and spatial sequencing to leprosy biopsy specimens. We focused on reversal reactions (RR), a dynamic process in which some patients with disseminated lepromatous leprosy (L-lep) transition towards self-limiting tuberculoid leprosy (T-lep), mounting effective antimicrobial responses. We identified a set of genes encoding proteins involved in antimicrobial responses that are differentially expressed in RR versus L-lep lesions, and regulated by IFN-\u03b3 and IL-1\u03b2. By integrating the spatial coordinates of the key cell types and antimicrobial gene expression in RR and T-lep lesions, we constructed a map revealing the organized architecture of granulomas depicting compositional and functional layers by which macrophages, T cells, keratinocytes and fibroblasts contribute to the antimicrobial response.","Urine accommodates more changes than other fluids, and it is a good source in the search for early sensitive biomarkers. The present study collected urine samples from 2-, 4-, 6-, 8- and 10-month-old \u03b1-synuclein transgenic mice. Based on data-independent acquisition (DIA) technology, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used for quantitative analysis. Seventeen human homologous differential proteins were screened and compared with those in the urine of 2-month-old mice, and 9 proteins were related to Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). Formin-2, Splicing factor 3A subunit 1, and Isopentenyl-diphosphate Delta-isomerase 1 changed continuously in months 6, 8 and 10. These experiments and analyses demonstrated that the urine proteome reflected the development of \u03b1-synuclein transgenic mice and provided clues for the early clinical diagnosis of PD.","Background Before Olympic and Paralympic Games in Tokyo, whether an audience shall be allowed or not has been a subject of concern in Japan as of early June, 2021. Object: We evaluated effects of professional baseball games with audiences as an example of the large sports events, on COVID-19 infectiousness.","Cell types are the fundamental building blocks of metazoan biodiversity and offer a powerful perspective for inferring evolutionary phenomena. With the development of single-cell transcriptomic techniques, new definitions of cell types are emerging. This allows a conceptual reassessment of traditional definitions of novel cell types and their evolution. Research in echinoderms, particularly sea star and sea urchin embryos have contributed significantly to understanding the evolution of novel cell types, in particular the primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs) and pigment cells that are found in sea urchin but not sea star embryos. This paper outlines the development of a gene expression atlas for the bat star, Patiria miniata, using single nuclear RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of embryonic stages. The atlas revealed 22 cell clusters covering all expected cell types from the endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm germ layers. In particular, four distinct neural clusters, an immune cluster, and distinct right and left coelom clusters were revealed as distinct cell states. A comparison with Strongylocentrotus purpuratus embryo single cell transcriptomes was performed using 1:1 orthologs to anchor and then compare gene expression patterns. S. purpuratus primordial germ cell equivalents were not detected in P. minata, while the left coelom of P. miniata has no equivalent cell cluster in S. purpuratus. Pigment cells of S. purpuratus map to clusters containing immune mesenchyme and neural cells of P. miniata, while the PMCs of S. purpuratus are revealed as orthologous to the right coelom cluster of P. miniata. These results suggest a new interpretation of the evolution of these well-studied cell types and a reflection on the definition of novel cell types.","Cryptosporidiosis is a leading cause of diarrhea in infants and immune-compromised individuals. The lack of effective drugs against this enteric infection is motivating research to develop alternative treatments. To this aim, the impact of probiotics on the course of cryptosporidiosis was explored. The native intestinal microbiota of specific pathogen-free immunosuppressed mice was initially depleted with orally administered antibiotics. Then, a commercially available probiotic product intended for human consumption was added (or not) to the drinking water. Probiotic treated and untreated mice were orally infected with Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts. On average, mice treated with probiotic excreted more oocysts, indicative of a more severe infection. The probiotic treatment significantly altered the fecal microbiota, but taxonomic analyses showed no direct association between ingestion of probiotic bacteria and their abundance in fecal microbiota. These results suggest that probiotics indirectly alter the intestinal microenvironment in such a way that favors proliferation of C. parvum. The increase in the relative abundance of facultative anaerobes observed in mice with severe cryptosporidiosis indicates that dysbiosis is a consequence of severe cryptosporidiosis. The increase in the abundance of facultative anaerobes observed in severely infected animals is consistent with analyses of microbiota from individuals infected with other enteric pathogens. The results are significant because they show that C. parvum responds to changes in the intestinal microenvironment induced by a nutritional supplement.","Plasticity of synaptic strength and density is a vital mechanism enabling memory consolidation, learning, and neurodevelopment. It is strongly dependent on the intact function of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR). The importance of NMDAR is further evident as their dysfunction is involved in many diseases such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, neurodevelopmental disorders, and epilepsies. Synaptic plasticity is thought to be reflected by changes of sleep slow wave slopes across the night, namely higher slopes after wakefulness at the beginning of sleep than after a night of sleep. Hence, a functional NMDAR deficiency should theoretically lead to altered overnight changes of slow wave slopes. Here we investigated whether pediatric patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis, being a very rare but unique human model of NMDAR deficiency due to autoantibodies against receptor subunits, indeed show alterations in this sleep EEG marker for synaptic plasticity.","Aquamin, a calcium-, magnesium-, and multiple trace element-rich natural product has polyp prevention efficacy based on preclinical studies. The overall goal of this study was to determine the safety and tolerability of Aquamin when used as a dietary chemopreventative in humans. Additionally, we determined the effects of Aquamin on the colonic microbial community and attendant metabolomic profile. Thirty healthy male and female human participants were enrolled in a 90-day trial in which the effects of Aquamin (delivering 800 mg of calcium per day) were compared to those of calcium alone or placebo. Before and after the interventional period, colonic biopsies and stool specimens were obtained. All 30 participants completed the study without serious adverse events. There were no changes in liver function markers. Compared to pretreatment values, intervention with Aquamin led to a reduction in total bacterial DNA and a shift in the microbial community. Treatment with calcium alone also produced a decline in total bacteria, but smaller than seen with Aquamin, while no reduction was observed with placebo. In parallel with microbial changes, a reduction in bile acid levels and a slight increase in the level of the short chain fatty acid (SCFA) acetate in stool specimens from Aquamin-treated participants was noted. No change in bile acids or SCFAs was observed with calcium alone or placebo. We conclude from these studies that Aquamin is safe and tolerable in healthy human participants and may produce beneficial alterations in the colonic microbial community and the attendant metabolomic profile.","Background and objective Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition where the underlying aetiology is still unclear. Investigating the potential influence of apolipoprotein e (APOE), a major genetic risk factor, on common blood biomarkers could provide a greater understanding of the mechanisms of AD and dementia risk. Our objective was to conduct the largest (to date) single-protocol investigation of blood biomarkers in the context of APOE genotype, in UK Biobank.","Background Lean body mass (LBM) is essential for health; however, consensus regarding the effectiveness of protein interventions in increasing LBM is lacking.","Corneal epithelial cells derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are an important cell source for preclinical models to test ophthalmic drugs. However, current differentiation protocols lack instructions regarding optimal culturing conditions, which hinders the quality of cells and limits scale-up. Here, we introduce a simplified small molecule-based corneal induction method (SSM-CI) to generate corneal epithelial cells from hPSCs. SSM-CI provides the advantage of minimizing cell culturing time using two defined culturing media containing TGF-\u03b2, and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway inhibitors, and bFGF growth factor over 25 days. Compared to the conventional human corneal epithelial cell line (HCE-T) and human primary corneal epithelial cells (hPCEpCs), corneal epithelial cells generated by SSM-CI are well-differentiated and express relevant maturation markers, including PAX6 and CK12. RNA-seq analysis indicated the faithful differentiation of hPSCs into corneal epithelia, with significant upregulation of corneal progenitor and adult corneal epithelial phenotypes. Furthermore, despite the initial inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, upregulation of these pathway-related transcripts was observed in the later stages, indicating their necessity in the generation of mature corneal epithelial cells. Moreover, we observed a shift in gene signatures associated with the metabolic characteristics of mature corneal epithelial cells, involving a decrease in glycolysis- and an increase in fatty acid oxidation. This was also attributed to the overexpression of metabolic enzymes and transporter-related transcripts responsible for fatty acid metabolism. Thus, SSM-CI provides a comprehensive method for the generation of functional corneal epithelial cells for use in preclinical models.","Context: Outdoor temperature and bright sunlight may directly and/or indirectly modulate systemic metabolism.","OBJECTIVE Undifferentiated arthritis (UA) is the term used to cover all the cases of arthritis that do not fit a specific diagnosis. A significant percentage of UA patients progress to rheumatoid arthritis (RA), others to a different definite rheumatic disease, and the rest undergo spontaneous remission. Therapeutic intervention in patients with UA can delay or halt disease progression and its long-term consequences. It is therefore of inherent interest to identify those UA patients with a high probability of progressing to RA who would benefit from early appropriate therapy. We hypothesised that alterations in the DNA methylation profiles of immune cells may inform on the genetically- or environmentally-determined status of patients and potentially discriminate between disease subtypes.","Background A lower allergy and asthma prevalence in farm children has been described three decades ago in Switzerland.","Purpose Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is global pandemic with more than 3 million deaths so far. Female reproductive tract organs express coronavirus-associated receptors and factors (SCARFs); suggesting they may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection however the susceptibility of ovary/follicle/oocyte to the same is still elusive. Co-morbidities like obesity, type-2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease etc. increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These features are common in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), warranting further scope to study SCARFs expression in ovary of these women.","Background Accumulating evidences have shown that lifestyle interventions such as exercise and diet are associated with improved sleep quality. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Assessing exercise and diet intervention associated changes in circulating metabolomics profile in people with insomnia symptoms may help to identify molecular biomarkers that may link lifestyle changes to improved sleep outcomes.","Purpose The Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW) was established in 2008 by the University of Wisconsin (UW) School of Medicine and Public Health (SMPH) with the goals of 1) providing a timely and accurate picture of the health of the state residents; and 2) serving as an agile resource infrastructure for ancillary studies. Today SHOW continues to serve as a vital population health research infrastructure.","Background Numerous epidemiological studies have investigated the role of blood lipids in prostate cancer (PCa) risk though findings remain inconclusive to date. The ongoing research has mainly involved observational studies which are often prone to confounding. This study aimed to identify the relationship between genetically predicted blood lipid concentrations and PCa.","Background Low and deficient levels of vitamin A are common in low and middle income countries where tuberculosis burden is high. We assessed the impact of baseline levels of vitamins A and carotenoids on TB disease risk.","Lipids are essential components of bacterial membranes and phages are quasi-ubiquitous in bacteria. Both are crucial mediators of bacteria-host interactions. In the major pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, two common prophages, \u03d511.1 and \u03d513, are preferentially integrated in lipase genes, respectively encoding Geh, a triglyceride lipase, and Hlb, a sphingomyelinase. Here we report how prophage status, and consequently lipase availability, impacts S. aureus metabolism of environmental lipids, and overall bacterial fitness. The fatty acid kinase subunit FakB1, known to promote saturated fatty acid incorporation, also facilitates incorporation of unsaturated fatty acids released from triglycerides by Geh; this process occurs only when \u03d511.1 is absent. Geh and Hlb lipase products compete for FakB1, and interference by prophage integration changes the outcome of this competition. Our findings could explain the selective advantage of prophage conservation, as a means of modulating bacterial membrane composition and preventing toxicity of environmental lipids. \u03d513 lysogeny also impaired the bacterial capacity to escape antibiotic inhibitors of FASII (fatty acid synthesis). We suggest that testing new therapeutics against S. aureus should consider prophage status and environmental lipids for accurate prediction of efficiency.","The avian hearing organ is the basilar papilla that, in sharp contrast to the mammalian cochlea, can regenerate sensory hair cells and thereby recover from complete deafness within weeks. The mechanisms that trigger, sustain, and terminate the regenerative response in vivo are largely unknown. Here, we profile the changes in gene expression in the chicken basilar papilla after aminoglycoside antibiotic-induced hair cell loss using RNA-sequencing. The most prominent changes in gene expression were linked to the upregulation of interferon response genes which occurred in supporting cells, confirmed by single-cell RNA-sequencing and in situ hybridization. We determined that the JAK/STAT signaling pathway is essential for the interferon gene response in supporting cells, set in motion by hair cell loss. Four days after ototoxic damage, we identified newly regenerated, nascent auditory hair cells that express genes linked to termination of the interferon response. These cells are incipient modified neurons that represent a population of hair cells en route towards obtaining their location-specific and fully functional cell identity. The robust, transient expression of immune-related genes in supporting cells suggests a potential functional involvement of JAK/STAT signaling and interferon in sensory hair cell regeneration.","Probiotic and prebiotic products have shown potential health benefits, including for the prevention of adverse pregnancy outcomes. The incidence of adverse effects in pregnant people and their infants associated with probiotic/prebiotic/synbiotic intake, however, remains unclear. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the evidence on adverse effects of maternal probiotic, prebiotic and/or synbiotic supplementation during pregnancy and lactation and interpret the findings to help inform clinical decision-making and care of this population. A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. Scientific databases were searched using pre-determined terms, and risk of bias assessments were conducted to determine study quality. Inclusion criteria were English language studies, human studies, access to full-text, and probiotic/prebiotic/synbiotic supplementation to the mother and not the infant. 11/100 eligible studies reported adverse effects and were eligible for inclusion in quantitative analysis, and data were visualised in a GOfER diagram. Probiotic and prebiotic products are safe for use during pregnancy and lactation. One study reported increased risk of vaginal discharge and changes in stool consistency (Relative Risk [95% CI]: 3.67 [1.04, 13.0]) when administering Lactobacillus rhamnosus and L. reuteri. Adverse effects associated with probiotic and prebiotic use do not pose any serious health concerns to mother or infant. Our findings and knowledge translation visualisations provide healthcare professionals and consumers with information to make evidence-informed decisions about the use of pre- and probiotics.","An outstanding mystery in biology is why some species, such as the axolotl, can scarlessly heal and regenerate tissues while most mammals cannot. Here, we demonstrate that rapid activation of protein synthesis is a unique, and previously uncharacterized, feature of the injury response critical for limb regeneration in the axolotl (A. mexicanum). By applying polysome sequencing, we identify hundreds of transcripts, including antioxidants and ribosome components, which do not change in their overall mRNA abundance but are selectively activated at the level of translation from pre-existing mRNAs in response to injury. In contrast, we show that protein synthesis is not activated in response to digit amputation in the non-regenerative mouse. We further identify the mTORC1 pathway as a key upstream signal that mediates this regenerative translation response in the axolotl. Inhibition of this pathway is sufficient to suppress translation and axolotl regeneration. Surprisingly, although mTOR is highly evolutionarily conserved, we discover unappreciated expansions in mTOR protein sequence among urodele amphibians. By engineering an axolotl mTOR in human cells, we demonstrate that this change creates a hypersensitive kinase that may allow axolotls to maintain this pathway in a highly labile state primed for rapid activation. This may underlie metabolic differences and nutrient sensing between regenerative and non-regenerative species that are key to regeneration. Together, these findings highlight the unanticipated impact of the translatome on orchestrating the early steps of wound healing in highly regenerative species and provide a missing link in our understanding of vertebrate regenerative potential.","The intestinal microbiome is implicated as an important modulating factor in multiple inflammatory,1,2 neurologic,3 and neoplastic diseases.4 Recent genome-wide association studies yielded inconsistent, underpowered and rarely replicated results such that the role of human host genetics as a contributing factor to microbiome assembly and structure remains uncertain.5\u201311 Nevertheless, twin-studies clearly suggest host-genetics as driver of microbiome composition.11 In a genome-wide association analysis of 8,956 German individuals, we identified 32 genetic loci to be associated with single bacteria and overall microbiome composition. Further analyses confirm the identified associations of ABO histo-blood groups and FUT2 secretor status with Bacteroides and Faecalibacterium. Mendelian randomization analysis suggests causative and protective effects of gut microbes, with clade-specific effects on inflammatory bowel disease. This holistic investigative approach of the host, its genetics, and its associated microbial communities as a \u2018metaorganism\u2019 broadens our understanding of disease aetiology and emphasizes the potential for implementing microbiota in disease treatment and management.","As humans dispersed out of Africa, they adapted to new environmental challenges including changes in exposure to mutagenic solar radiation. Humans in temperate latitudes have acquired light skin that is relatively transparent to ultraviolet light, and some evidence suggests that their DNA damage response pathways have also experienced local adaptation. This raises the possibility that different populations have experienced different selective pressures affecting genome integrity. Here, I present evidence that the rate of a particular mutation type has recently increased in the European population, rising in frequency by 50% during the 40,000\u201380,000 years since Europeans began diverging from Asians. A comparison of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) private to Africa, Asia, and Europe in the 1000 Genomes data reveals that private European variation is enriched for the transition 5\u2019-TCC-3\u2019\u21925\u2019-TTC-3\u2019. Although it is not clear whether UV played a causal role in the changing the European mutational spectrum, 5\u2019-TCC-3\u2019\u21925\u2019-TTC-3\u2019 is known to be the most common somatic mutation present in melanoma skin cancers, as well as the mutation most frequently induced in vitro by UV. Regardless of its causality, this change indicates that DNA replication fidelity has not remained stable even since the origin of modern humans and might have changed numerous times during our recent evolutionary history.","Pro-inflammatory immune responses are necessary for effective pathogen clearance, but cause severe tissue damage if not shut down in a timely manner1,2. Excessive complement and IFN-\u03b3-associated responses are known drivers of immunopathogenesis3 and are among the most highly induced immune programs in hyper-inflammatory SARS-CoV2 lung infection4. The molecular mechanisms that govern orderly shutdown and retraction of these responses remain poorly understood. Here, we show that complement triggers contraction of IFN-\u03b3 producing CD4+ T helper (Th) 1 cell responses by inducing expression of the vitamin D (VitD) receptor (VDR) and CYP27B1, the enzyme that activates VitD, permitting T cells to both activate and respond to VitD. VitD then initiates the transition from pro-inflammatory IFN-\u03b3+ Th1 cells to suppressive IL-10+ Th1 cells. This process is primed by dynamic changes in the epigenetic landscape of CD4+ T cells, generating superenhancers and recruiting c-JUN and BACH2, a key immunoregulatory transcription factor5\u20137. Accordingly, cells in psoriatic skin treated with VitD increased BACH2 expression, and BACH2 haplo-insufficient CD4+ T cells were defective in IL-10 production. As proof-of-concept, we show that CD4+ T cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of patients with COVID-19 are Th1-skewed and that VDR is among the top regulators of genes induced by SARS-CoV2. Importantly, genes normally down-regulated by VitD were de-repressed in CD4+ BALF T cells of COVID-19, indicating that the VitD-driven shutdown program is impaired in this setting. The active metabolite of VitD, alfacalcidol, and cortico-steroids were among the top predicted pharmaceuticals that could normalize SARS-CoV2 induced genes. These data indicate that adjunct therapy with VitD in the context of other immunomodulatory drugs may be a beneficial strategy to dampen hyperinflammation in severe COVID-19.","An imbalance between extracellular and intracellular fluid osmolality causes osmotic stress and affects cellular homeostasis. Recent research suggests that osmotic stress is also associated with various innate and adaptive immune responses. Here we present the surprising finding that osmolality tightly controls the expression of cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide (CAMP) in human macrophages. CAMP expression is strongly upregulated under hyperosmotic conditions and downregulated under hypoosmotic conditions. We also provide evidence that this osmolality-mediated antimicrobial response is dependent on nuclear factor of activated T-cells 5 (NFAT5) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38. Finally, Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation inhibits osmolality-mediated expression of CAMP in human macrophages, suggesting that this osmolality-dependent regulation of CAMP is more relevant under homeostatic conditions, rather than during acute infections. This study expands our knowledge of the regulation of human antimicrobial peptides and highlights osmolality as an important and independent factor shaping host innate immune homeostasis.","Interest in the genetic basis of variation in skin pigmentation in Native American populations led us to seek indigenous populations of the Western Hemisphere with African and minimal European admixture to study the effect of Native American ancestry on skin color. Admixture analysis from DNA collected from 458 individuals in the Kalinago territory of the Commonwealth of Dominica showed shared ancestry with East Asians at K=3 and 55% Native American, 32% African, and 11% European ancestry at K=6, the highest Native American ancestry of Caribbean populations. Skin pigmentation was 20 to 80 melanin units, averaging 46. Three albino individuals were homozygous for multi-nucleotide polymorphism OCA2NW273KV of African origin, whose population allele frequency was 0.03 and single allele effect size was \u22128 melanin units. Hypopigmenting allele frequencies for SLC24A5A111T and SLC45A2L374F were 0.14 and 0.05, whose single allele effect sizes were \u22126 and \u22123, respectively. Skin color plots of individuals lacking known hypopigmenting alleles suggests that Native American Ancestry reduced pigmentation by more than 20 melanin units (low and high estimates 21.8 and 28.5). Shared ancestry with East Asians at K=3 suggests potential sharing of one or more pigmentation alleles.","Background Tuberculosis, an infectious disease, is one of the top 10 causes of death, and the leading cause from a single infectious agent M. tuberculosis. According to recent WHO estimate report, at least 3100 new TB cases occur every year in Eritrea. However, very little information is available in Eritrea related to area specific prevalence of tuberculosis and risk factors attributed to it. This is a retrospective study aimed to assess the prevalence of tuberculosis disease among patients attending at Nakfa Hospital, Eritrea.","The initiation of lactation challenges the ability of the modern lactating cow to maintain calcium homeostasis, and typically results in a drop in blood calcium levels; leading to mobilization of calcium reserves from skeletal stores. As such, the recommendation to provide supplemental calcium at parturition to older cows has become an industry-standard practice. Mature cows were treated at calving and 12 hours later with either the novel calcium bolus (NB), or a commercially available calcium bolus (CB). Blood was collected from animals at 0, 1, 6, 12, 13, and 24 hours following calving, and the resulting serum samples were analyzed. Overall, there was no statistical difference between the NB and CB groups for blood calcium levels within the first 24 hours following parturition (P = 0.50). Cows in both groups experienced a significant increase in serum calcium by 1 hour after parturition; however, this increase was not sustained through subsequent sampling times. This pilot study demonstrates that both boluses have a similar effect in the elevation of blood calcium.","Background Moderate-to-severe subacute thyroiditis is commonly treated with 6-8 weeks glucocorticoids; however, no studies have described short-term prednisone treatment for subacute thyroiditis. We evaluated the efficacy of this treatment for subacute thyroiditis.","Background Although genome-wide association studies have identified many genomic regions associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), the causal genes and functions remain largely unknown. Many bulk and single-cell expression data have become available for IPF, and there is increasing evidence suggesting a shared genetic basis between IPF and other diseases.","Objectives We examined the influence of the ex vivo combination therapy of metformin (Met, 1,1-dimethylbiguanide hydrochloride) with sodium selenite (Ss, Na2SeO3) on the changes in the production of nitric oxide (NO) and selected cytokines by circulating monocytes (MOs) during T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL).","Objectives To characterize the demographics, comorbidities, symptoms, in-hospital treatments, and health outcomes among children/adolescents diagnosed or hospitalized with COVID-19. Secondly, to describe health outcomes amongst children/adolescents diagnosed with previous seasonal influenza.","Cardiac pathologies are characterized by intense remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) that eventually leads to heart failure. Cardiomyocytes respond to the ensuing biomechanical stress by re-expressing fetal contractile proteins via transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes, like alternative splicing (AS). Here, we demonstrate that the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C (hnRNPC) is upregulated and relocates to the sarcomeric Z-disk upon ECM pathological remodeling. We show that this is an active site of localized translation, where the ribonucleoprotein associates to the translation machinery. Alterations in hnRNPC expression and localization can be mechanically determined and affect the AS of numerous mRNAs involved in mechanotransduction and cardiovascular diseases, like Hippo pathway effector YAP1. We propose that cardiac ECM remodeling serves as a switch in RNA metabolism by impacting an associated regulatory protein of the spliceosome apparatus. These findings offer new insights on the mechanism of mRNAs homeostasis mechanoregulation in pathological conditions.","Maternal nutritional status influences fetal development and long-term risk for adult non-communicable diseases. The underlying mechanisms of these long-term effects remain poorly understood. We examined whether maternal biomarkers for metabolism and inflammation during pregnancy were associated with child biomarkers in the Supplementation with Multiple Micronutrients Intervention Trial (SUMMIT, ISRCTN34151616) in Lombok, Indonesia wherein archived blood specimens and relevant data were available from pregnant women and their children 9-12 years after birth. Forty-four mother-child dyads comprising 132 specimens were analyzed by multiplex microbead immunoassays to quantify vitamin D-binding protein (D), adiponectin (A), retinol-binding protein 4 (R), C-reactive protein (C), and leptin (L). Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed distinct variance patterns, i.e. principal components (PC), for baseline pregnancy bp.pc1.D\u2193A\u2193R\u2193 and bp.pc2.C\u2193L\u2191; combined follow-up and post-partum dp-pp.pc1.D\u2191\u2193A\u2191R\u2191\u2193L\u2193 and dp-pp.pc2.A\u2191C\u2191L\u2191; and children ch.pc1.D\u2191R\u2191C\u2191 and ch.pc2.D\u2193A\u2191L\u2191. Maternal multiple micronutrient (MMN) supplementation modified the association between baseline maternal bp.pc2.C\u2193L\u2191 and post-supplementation maternal dp-pp.pc2.A\u2193C\u2191L\u2191 (p=0.022). Significant associations were found between maternal dp-pp.pc2.A\u2191C\u2191L\u2191 and increased child \u2018s ch.pc1.D\u2191R\u2191C\u2191 (p=0.036), and decreased child \u2018s BMI z-score (BMIZ) (p=0.022); and between maternal dp-pp.pc1.D\u2191\u2193A\u2191R\u2191\u2193L\u2191 and increased child \u2018s BMIZ (p=0.036). Child \u2018s ch.pc1.D\u2191R\u2191C\u2191 was associated with decreased birth weight (p=0.036), and increased child\u2019s BMIZ (p=0.002); and ch.pc2.D\u2193A\u2191L\u2191 was associated with increased child\u2019s BMIZ (p=0.005), decreased maternal height (p=0.030) and girls (p=0.002). Elevated adiponectin and leptin pattern in pregnancy was associated with increased C-reactive protein and vitamin A and D binding proteins pattern in children, suggesting biomarkers acting in concert may be more important than single biomarker effects. Patterns in pregnancy proximal to birth were more associated with child status, and child patterns were most frequently associated with child status, particularly child BMI. Although MMN supplementation and certain maternal biomarker patterns have effects on metabolism and inflammation in pregnancy and in the child, nevertheless, nutrition conditions after birth may have a greater impact.","Background Current TB diagnostic methods available have been developed for adults and development efforts have neglected the differences in disease and sampling that occur between adults and children. Diagnostic challenges are even greater in HIV co-infected children and infants.","Serine/threonine protein kinase C (PKC) is activated by diacylglycerol that is released from membrane lipids by phospholipase C in response to activation of G protein-coupled receptors or receptor tyrosine kinases. PKC isoforms are particularly relevant for proliferation and differentiation of cells including osteoblasts. Osteoblasts/osteocytes produce fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a hormone regulating renal phosphate and vitamin D handling. PKC activates NF\u03baB, a transcription factor complex controlling FGF23 expression. Here, we analyzed the impact of PKC on FGF23 synthesis. Fgf23 expression was analyzed by qRT-PCR in UMR106 osteoblastlike cells and in IDG-SW3 osteocytes. Phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (PMA), a PKC activator, up-regulated Fgf23 expression. In contrast, PKC inhibitors calphostin C, G\u00f66976, sotrastaurin and ruboxistaurin supressed Fgf23 gene expression. NF\u03baB inhibitor withaferin A abolished the stimulatory effect of PMA on Fgf23. PKC is a powerful regulator of FGF23 synthesis, an effect which is at least partly mediated by NF\u03baB.","The complex nature of the transcriptional networks underlying addictive behaviors suggests intricate cooperation between diverse gene regulation mechanisms that go beyond canonical activity-dependent pathways. Here we implicate in this process a novel nuclear receptor transcription factor, Retinoid X Receptor Alpha (RXR\u03b1), which we identified bioinformatically as associated with addiction-like behaviors. In the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of male and female mice, we show that, while its own expression remains unaltered after cocaine exposure, RXR\u03b1 controls plasticity- and addiction-relevant transcriptional programs in both dopamine receptor D1- and D2-expressing medium spiny neurons, which in turn modulate intrinsic excitability and synaptic activity of these NAc cell types. Behaviorally, bidirectional viral and pharmacological manipulation of RXR\u03b1 regulates drug reward sensitivity in both non-operant and operant paradigms. Together, this study demonstrates a key role for NAc RXR\u03b1 in promoting drug addiction, and paves the way for future studies of rexinoid signaling in psychiatric disease states.","Objective The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has spread across the world causing a dramatic number of infections and deaths. No data are available about the effects of an infection in patients affected by celiac disease (CD) in terms of the development of related symptoms and antibodies. We aimed to investigate the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in celiac patients.","Cardiomyocyte (CM) proliferative potential varies considerably across species. While lower vertebrates and neonatal mammals retain robust capacities for CM proliferation, adult mammalian CMs lose proliferative potential due to cell-cycle withdrawal and polyploidization, failing to mount a proliferative response to regenerate lost CMs after cardiac injury. The decline of murine CM proliferative potential occurs in the neonatal period when the endocrine system undergoes drastic changes for adaptation to extrauterine life. We recently demonstrated that thyroid hormone (TH) signaling functions as a primary factor driving CM proliferative potential loss in vertebrates. Whether other hormonal pathways govern this process remains largely unexplored. Here we showed that agonists of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and vitamin D receptor (VDR) suppressed neonatal CM proliferation in vitro. We next examined CM nucleation and proliferation in mutant mice lacking GR or VDR specifically in CMs, but we observed no difference between mutant and control littermates. Additionally, we generated compound mutant mice that lack GR or VDR and express dominant-negative TH receptor alpha in their CMs, and similarly observed no increase in CM proliferative potential compared to dominant-negative TH receptor alpha mice alone. Thus, although GR and VDR activation in cultured CMs is sufficient to inhibit CM proliferation, they seem to be dispensable for CM cell-cycle exit and binucleation in vivo. In addition, given the recent report that VDR activation in zebrafish promotes CM proliferation and tissue regeneration, our results suggest distinct roles of VDR in zebrafish and rodent CM cell-cycle regulation.","Background Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) has a huge negative impact on gait parameters and on many components of biomechanics, including impairment of dynamic lower limb alignment and control of lumbopelvic movement. Specifically addressing these problems in treatment regimens is therefore critical but they must first be studied in detail before they can be used clinically to treat patients with KOA. This study protocol focuses on whether Mulligan joint mobilization with movement demonstrably decreases pain and restores healthy joint biomechanics and whether trunk stabilization exercises improve stability of the trunk, thereby distributing the weight of the body evenly on both feet. Because the treatment effects of neither treatment are conclusive, this study aims to determine their efficacy versus isometric knee strengthening.","Peptide-based inhibitors hold great potential for targeted modulation of intracellular protein-protein interactions (PPIs) by leveraging vast chemical space relative to primary structure via sequence diversity as well as conformationally through varying secondary and tertiary structures. However, the development of peptide therapeutics has been hindered because of their limited conformational stability, proteolytic sensitivity and cell permeability. Several contemporary peptide design strategies address these issues to varying degrees. Strategic macrocyclization through optimally placed chemical braces such as olefinic hydrocarbon crosslinks, commonly referred to as staples, may address these issues by i) restricting conformational freedom to improve target affinities, ii) improving proteolytic resistance, and iii) enhancing cell permeability. Conversely, molecules constructed entirely from D-amino acids are hyper-resistant to proteolytic cleavage, but generally lack conformational stability and membrane permeability. Since neither approach is a complete solution, we have combined these strategies to identify the first examples of all-D \u03b1-helical stapled and stitched peptides. As a template, we used a recently reported all D-linear peptide that is a potent inhibitor of the p53-Mdm2 interaction, but is devoid of cellular activity. To design both stapled and stitched all-D-peptide analogues, we used computational modelling to predict optimal staple placement. The resultant novel macrocyclic all D-peptide was determined to exhibit increased \u03b1-helicity, improved target binding, complete proteolytic stability and, most notably, cellular activity.","Testing for associations in big data faces the problem of multiple comparisons, with true signals buried inside the noise of all associations queried. This is particularly true in genetic association studies where a substantial proportion of the variation of human phenotypes is driven by numerous genetic variants of small effect. The current strategy to improve power to identify these weak associations consists of applying standard marginal statistical approaches and increasing study sample sizes. While successful, this approach does not leverage the environmental and genetic factors shared between the multiple phenotypes collected in contemporary cohorts. Here we develop a method that improves the power of detecting associations when a large number of correlated variables have been measured on the same samples. Our analyses over real and simulated data provide direct support that large sets of correlated variables can be leveraged to achieve dramatic increases in statistical power equivalent to a two or even three folds increase in sample size.","L-DOPA Induced Dyskinesia (LID) is associated with prolonged L-DOPA therapy. Vitamin-D receptor modulation improves motor-cognitive deficit in experimental LID Parkinsonism. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the mechanism underlying the anti-dyskinetic potential of Vitamin D3 (VD3). Dyskinesia was induced by chronic L-DOPA administration in 6-OHDA lesioned male C57BL6 mice. The experimental groups (Dyskinesia, Dyskinesia/VD3, and Dyskinesia/Amantadine) and controls were challenged with L-DOPA to determine the abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) score during 14 days of VD3 (30 mg/kg) or Amantadine (40 mg/kg) treatment. Global behavioral Axial, Limb &amp; Orolingual (ALO) AIMs were scored for 1 min at every 20 mins interval, over a duration of 100 mins on days 1,3,7,11 and 14 of treatment. Thereafter, brain samples were collected and processed for immunoblotting to assess striatal expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), monoamine oxidase (MAO), cathecol-o-methyl transferase (COMT), dopamine decarboxylase (DDC), CD11b, BAX, P47phox, and IL-1\u03b2. VD3 significantly attenuated ALO AIMs only on days 11 &amp; 14, with maximal reduction of 32.7% compared with dyskinetic mice but had no effect on days 1, 3 &amp; 7, while amantadine decreased AIMs all through days 1 to 14 with maximal reduction of 64.5%. TH and MAO-B expression were not significantly different across the groups. DDC was significantly suppressed in dyskinetic mice vs control (p&lt;0.001) but remained unchanged in VD3 mice vs dyskinetic mice. COMT was upregulated in the dyskinetic group vs control (p&lt;0.01) and attenuated in VD3 mice (p&lt;0.05) compared to the dyskinetic group. Interestingly, VD3 inhibited significantly (p&lt;0.01) oxidative stress (p47phox), apoptosis (BAX), inflammation (IL-1\u03b2), and microglial activation (CD11b) in dyskinetic mice. Overall, we find that the anti-dyskinetic effects of VD3 is associated with modulation of striatal oxidative stress, microglial responses, inflammation, and apoptotic signaling.","Background Gut microbiota (GM) composition has been associated with acute Graft-versus-Host Disease (aGvHD), however, current knowledge is insufficient to target the GM.","Background Metals exposures have important health effects in pregnancy. The maternal epigenome may be responsive to these exposures. We tested whether metals are associated with concurrent differential maternal whole blood DNA methylation.","Electron transfer mediated by metalloproteins drives many biological processes. Rubredoxins are ubiquitous iron-containing electron carriers that play important roles in bacterial adaptation to changing environmental conditions. In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, oxidative and acidic stresses as well as iron starvation induce rubredoxin expression. However, their functions during M. tuberculosis infection is unknown. In the present work, we show that rubredoxin B (RubB) supports catalytic activity of mycobacterial cytochrome P450s, CYP124, CYP125, and CYP142, which are important for bacterial viability and pathogenicity. We solved the crystal structure of RubB and characterized the interaction between RubB and CYPs using site-directed mutagenesis. Mutations that neutralized single charge on the surface of RubB did not dramatically decrease activity of studied CYPs, and isothermal calorimetry (ITC) experiments indicated that interactions are transient and not highly specific. Our findings suggest that a switch from ferredoxins to rubredoxins support CYP activity in M. tuberculosis-infected macrophages. Our electrochemical experiments suggest potential applications of RubB in biotechnology.","Background and aim Genetic markers are established as predictive of type 1 diabetes, but unknown early life environment is believed to be involved. Umbilical cord blood may reflect perinatal metabolism and exposures. We studied whether selected polar metabolites in cord blood contribute to prediction of type 1 diabetes.","Objective Characterization of the clinical features of patients with persistent symptoms after mild to moderate COVID-19 infection and exploration of factors associated with the development of Chronic COVID-19 Syndrome (CCS).","Host-derived antimicrobial peptides play an important role in the defense against extracellular bacterial infections. However, the capacity of antimicrobial peptides derived from macrophages as potential antibacterial effectors against intracellular pathogens remains unknown. In this study, we report that normal (wild type, WT) mouse macrophages increased their expression of the cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide (CRAMP) after infection by viable E. coli or stimulation with inactivated E. coli and its product LPS, a process involving activation of NF-\u03baB followed by protease-dependent conversion of CRAMP from an inactive precursor to an active form. The active CRAMP was required by WT macrophages to eliminate phagocytosed E. coli, with participation of autophagy-related proteins ATG5, LC3-II, and LAMP-1 as well as conjugation of the bacteria with p62. The autophagy-mediated elimination of E. coli was impaired in CRAMP\u2212/\u2212 macrophages resulting in retention of intracellular bacteria and fragmentation of macrophages. These results indicate CRAMP as a critical component in autophagy-mediated clearance of intracellular E. coli by macrophages.","The interleukin 7 receptor (IL7R) is strongly associated with increased risk to develop multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system, and this association is likely driven by upregulation of the soluble isoform of IL7R (sIL7R). Expression of sIL7R is determined by exclusion of the alternative exon 6 from IL7R transcripts, and our previous work revealed that the MS risk allele of the SNP rs6897932 within this exon enhances the expression of sIL7R by promoting exclusion of exon 6. sIL7R potentiates the activity of IL7, leading to enhanced expansion of T cells and increased disability in the Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) murine model of MS. This role in modulating T cell-driven immunity positions sIL7R as an attractive therapeutic target whose expression could be reduced for treatment of MS or increased for treatment of cancers. In this study we identified novel antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that effectively control the inclusion (anti-sIL7R ASOs) or exclusion (pro-sIL7R ASOs) of this exon in a dose-dependent fashion. These ASOs provided excellent control of exon 6 splicing and sIL7R secretion in human primary CD4+ T cells. Supporting their potential for therapeutic targeting, we showed that lead anti-sIL7R ASOs correct the enhanced exon 6 exclusion imposed by the MS risk allele of rs6897932, whereas lead pro-sIL7R ASOs phenocopy it. The data presented here form the foundation for future pre-clinical studies that will test the therapeutic potential of these ASOs in MS and immuno-oncology.","Viruses and bacteria are the cause of a large number of different human diseases. It is believed that some of them may even contribute to the development of cancer. The present work is dedicated to the identification of mycoplasmas in patients with breast cancer. Mycoplasmas may participate in the development of several human diseases including chronic fatigue syndrome, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, atypical pneumonia, etc. Moreover, there is a reason to believe that mycoplasma can participate in the development of cancer, leukemia and lymphoma.","  Participant level meta-analysis across multiple studies increases the sample\nsize for pooled analyses, thereby improving precision in effect estimates and\nenabling subgroup analyses. For analyses involving biomarker measurements as an\nexposure of interest, investigators must first calibrate the data to address\nmeasurement variability arising from usage of different laboratories and/or\nassays. In practice, the calibration process involves reassaying a random\nsubset of biospecimens from each study at a central laboratory and fitting\nmodels that relate the study-specific \"local\" and central laboratory\nmeasurements. Previous work in this area treats the calibration process from\nthe perspective of measurement error techniques and imputes the estimated\ncentral laboratory value among individuals with only a local laboratory\nmeasurement. In this work, we propose a repeated measures method to calibrate\nbiomarker measurements pooled from multiple studies with study-specific\ncalibration subsets. We account for correlation between measurements made on\nthe same person and between measurements made at the same laboratory. We\ndemonstrate that the repeated measures approach provides valid inference, and\ncompare it to existing calibration approaches grounded in measurement error\ntechniques in an example describing the association between circulating vitamin\nD and stroke.\n","Treg are critical regulators of immune homeostasis, and increasing evidence demonstrates that environment-driven Treg differentiation into effector (e)Treg is crucial for optimal functioning. However, human Treg programming under inflammatory conditions remains poorly understood. Here, we combine transcriptional and epigenetic profiling to identify the human eTreg core signature. Functional autoimmune inflammation-derived Treg display a unique transcriptional profile characterized by upregulation of both a core Treg (FOXP3, CTLA-4, TIGIT) and effector program (GITR, BLIMP-1, BATF). We identified a specific human eTreg signature that includes the vitamin D receptor (VDR) as predicted key-regulator in eTreg differentiation. H3K27ac/H3K4me1 occupancy revealed pronounced changes in the (super-)enhancer landscape, including enrichment of the binding motif for VDR and BATF. The observed Treg profile showed striking overlap with tumor-infiltrating Treg. Our data demonstrate that human inflammation-derived Treg acquire a specific eTreg profile guided by epigenetic changes. The core eTreg profile is conserved, and fine-tuned by environment-specific adaptations.","Introduction Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In humans, a number of genes have been identified as susceptible to pulmonary tuberculosis. The relationship between NRAMP1 polymorphisms and pulmonary tuberculosis has been studied in different populations and has reported contradictory results. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the common polymorphisms of NRAMP1 gene and the susceptibility to pulmonary tuberculosis in the LUR Population of Lorestan province of Iran.","Background It is plausible that maternal pregnancy metabolism influences risk of offspring congenital heart disease (CHD). We sought to explore this through a systematic approach using different methods and data.","Background Storage time influence concentration levels of blood biomarker. This study aimed to assess the effect of water intake prior sampling and storage time on protein concentration, enzyme AChE activity, inhibitor efficacy and to build an efficient inhibitor calibration curve in healthy individuals.","The mouse hairless gene (Hr) encodes a protein of 127 kDa, acting as corepressor of nuclear hormone receptors. The Hairless protein (HR) is involved in the control of the cellular transition to the first hair cycle in adult Mammals. In its absence hair follicles disintegrate leading to a complete and irreversible hair loss with formation of cutaneous cysts. The hairless phenotype is therefore linked to defective proliferation and migration of the hair follicle stem cells apparently unable to respond to various signalling molecules. The Hr gene is expressed at high levels in skin and brain, and hairless transcripts were detected in gonads, thymus and colon. Although the patterns of Hr expression appear to be spatially and temporally regulated, very little is known about the molecular basis of the transcriptional control underlying Hr gene function. In this work we determine the precise transcriptional initiation start site of the mouse Hr gene and identify a new 1,1 kb cis-control element (RE1) that encompasses the promoter region and is able to drive luciferase reporter expression in skin and brain derived cell lines. We performed a deletion analysis and explored functionally regulatory motifs within this fragment to show that the role of this upstream regulatory region is linked to the presence of TRE and VDRE binding sites. We find that a TRE situated at \u2013300 bp from the cap site is essential for gene expression in both skin NIH 3T3 and GHFT1 cells, while a VDRE positioned 94 bp upstream of the TRE modulates reporter expression specifically in skin derived cell lines. In addition, we define a novel cis-regulatory motif UE60, situated at the 5\u2019-end of RE1 and likely to interact with both TRE and VDRE. Our data complete previous results on the possible existence of an autoregulatory pathway, implicated in Hr gene regulation. Taken together these findings reveal a complex molecular network that potentially links several signalling pathways in hair follicle formation. We discuss the organisation of the regulatory modules in the mouse Hr gene upstream DNA sequences in the light of the high homology of this region in mouse, rat and human.","The ancestor of most teleost fishes underwent a whole-genome duplication event three hundred million years ago. Despite its antiquity, the effects of this event are evident both in the structure of teleost genomes and in how those genes still operate to drive form and function. I describe the inference of a set of shared syntenic regions that survive from the teleost genome duplication (TGD) using eight teleost genomes and the outgroup gar genome (which lacks the TGD). I phylogenetically modeled the resolution of the TGD via shared and independent gene losses, concluding that it was likely an allopolyploidy event due to the biased pattern of these gene losses. Duplicate genes surviving from this duplication in zebrafish are less likely to function in early embryo development than are genes that have returned to single copy. As a result, surviving ohnologs function later in development, and the pattern of which tissues these ohnologs are expressed in and their functions lend support to recent suggestions that the TGD was the source of a morphological innovation in the structure of the teleost retina. Surviving duplicates also appear less likely to be essential than singletons, despite the fact that their single-copy orthologs in mouse are no less essential than other genes. Nonetheless, the surviving duplicates occupy central positions in the zebrafish metabolic network.","Introduction The highly heterogenous disease transmission pattern of COVID-19 suggests that the pandemic maybe driven by complex factors, which may include habitat suitability, region specific human mobility, and transmission related to susceptibility. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of different spatial and demographic factors on COVID-19 transmission and case fatality worldwide.","The increase in activity of the two-pore potassium-leak channel Kcnk5b maintains allometric juvenile growth of adult zebrafish appendages. However, it remains unknown how this channel maintains allometric growth and how its bioelectric activity is regulated to scale these anatomical structures. We show the activation of Kcnk5b is sufficient to activate several genes that are part of important development programs. We provide in vivo transplantation evidence that the activation of gene transcription is cell autonomous. We also show that Kcnk5b will induce the expression of different subsets of the tested developmental genes in different cultured mammalian cell lines, which may explain how one electrophysiological stimulus can coordinately regulate the allometric growth of diverse populations of cells in the fin that use different developmental signals. We also provide evidence that the post-translational modification of serine 345 in Kcnk5b by calcineurin regulates channel activity to scale the fin. Thus, we show how an endogenous bioelectric mechanism can be regulated to promote coordinated developmental signaling to generate and scale a vertebrate appendage.","The downregulation of miRNA-22 in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is associated with upregulation of eukaryotic elongation 2 factor kinase (eEF2K) protein, which regulates tumor growth, chemoresistance, and tumor immunosurveillance. Moreover, exogenous administration of miRNA-22, loaded in nanoparticles to prevent degradation and improve tumor delivery (termed miRNA-22 nanotherapy), to suppress eEF2K production has shown potential as an investigational therapeutic agent in vivo. To evaluate the translational potential of miRNA-22 nanotherapy, we developed a multiscale mechanistic model, calibrated to published in vivo data and extrapolated to the human scale, to describe and quantify the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of miRNA-22 in virtual patient populations. Our analysis revealed the dose-response relationship, suggested optimal treatment frequency for miRNA-22 nanotherapy, and highlighted key determinants of therapy response, from which combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors was identified as a candidate strategy for improving treatment outcomes. More importantly, drug synergy was identified between miRNA-22 and standard-of-care drugs for TNBC, providing a basis for rational therapeutic combinations for improved response.","Background Lethality rates of COVID-19 are so different between countries and continents. This lethality seems to be very low in Africa and Asia, but exceedingly high in western Europe and North America. Many factors could have a role in this disparity such as comorbidities. Advanced age, obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer were the most frequently cited in the reported COVID-19 data. The main objective was to analyze and evaluate the association between the COVID-19 mortality and the mentioned factors in 164 countries.","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system with a modest concordance rate in monozygotic twins that strongly argues for involvement of epigenetic factors. We observe in 45 MS discordant monozygotic twins highly similar peripheral blood mononuclear cell-based methylomes. However, a few MS-associated differentially methylated positions (DMP) were identified and validated, including a region in the TMEM232 promoter and ZBTB16 enhancer. In CD4+ T cells we observed an MS-associated differentially methylated region in FIRRE. In addition, many regions showed large methylation differences in individual pairs, but were not clearly associated with MS. Furthermore, epigenetic biomarkers for current interferon-beta treatment were identified, and extensive validation revealed the ZBTB16 DMP as a signature of prior glucocorticoid treatment. Altogether, our study represents an important reference for epigenomic MS studies. It identifies new candidate epigenetic markers, highlights treatment effects and genetic background as major confounders, and argues against some previously reported MS-associated epigenetic candidates.","Canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signalling regulates self-renewal and lineage selection within the mouse epidermis. Although the transcriptional response of keratinocytes that receive a Wnt signal is well characterised, little is known about the mechanism by which keratinocytes in proximity to the Wntreceiving cell are co-opted to undergo a change in cell fate. To address this, we performed single-cell mRNA-Seq on mouse keratinocytes co-cultured with and without the presence of beta-catenin activated neighbouring cells. We identified seven distinct cell states in cultures that had not been exposed to the beta-catenin stimulus and show that the stimulus redistributes wild type subpopulation proportions. Using temporal single-cell analysis we reconstruct the cell fate changes induced by neighbour Wnt activation. Gene expression heterogeneity was reduced in neighbouring cells and this effect was most dramatic for protein synthesis associated genes. The changes in gene expression were accompanied by a shift from a quiescent to a more proliferative stem cell state. By integrating imaging and reconstructed sequential gene expression changes during the state transition we identified transcription factors, including Smad4 and Bcl3, that were responsible for effecting the transition in a contact-dependent manner. Our data indicate that non cell-autonomous Wnt/beta-catenin signalling decreases transcriptional heterogeneity and further our understanding of how epidermal Wnt signalling orchestrates regeneration and self-renewal.","Glucocorticoids (GCs) exert potent anti-inflammatory effects in immune cells through the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Dendritic cells (DCs), central actors for coordinating immune responses, acquire tolerogenic properties in response to GCs. Tolerogenic DCs (tolDCs) have emerged as a potential treatment for various inflammatory diseases. To date, the underlying cell type-specific regulatory mechanisms orchestrating GC-mediated acquisition of immunosuppressive properties remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the transcriptomic and epigenomic remodeling associated with differentiation to DCs in the presence of GCs. Our analysis demonstrates a major role of MAFB in this process, in synergy with GR. GR and MAFB both interact with methylcytosine dioxygenase TET2 and bind to genomic loci that undergo specific demethylation in tolDCs. We also show that the role of MAFB is more extensive, binding to thousands of genomic loci in tolDCs. Finally, MAFB knockdown erases the tolerogenic properties of tolDCs and reverts the specific DNA demethylation and gene upregulation. The preeminent role of MAFB is also demonstrated in vivo for myeloid cells from synovium in rheumatoid arthritis following GC treatment. Our results imply that, once directly activated by GR, MAFB takes over the main roles to orchestrate the epigenomic and transcriptomic remodeling that define the tolerogenic phenotype.","The study sought to investigate how the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 have evolved in the most recent three months across the world, and what insights the trends may provide about the second half of the pandemic\u2019s first year using a situation analysis approach based on national income, temperature, trade intensity with China, and location defined by longitude and latitude. The study confirmed the negative relationship between COVID-19 cases and temperature. It contributed to the resolution of the conflicting results about latitude after organizing it into a categorical variable instead of its continuous form. This approach works because the average temperature in the 15\u00b0S to 15\u00b0N region remains similar to the average temperatures in both the Above 15\u00b0N region and the Below 15\u00b0S region during their summer months because the 15\u00b0S to 15\u00b0N region does not experience the marked seasonal changes in temperature. Given the negative association between temperature and case numbers, this suggests that countries in the 15\u00b0S to 15\u00b0N region might continue exhibiting the low numbers they have thus far exhibited through the second half of this year, even as numbers climb in the Below 15\u00b0S region. To succeed, their policymakers must control importation of the disease by implementing effective testing, quarantining, and contact tracing for people entering their borders. Policymakers in countries Below 15\u00b0S region may manage their inherent risks by applying lessons learned from countries in the Above 15\u00b0N region during these past months. Such preventative measures may allow the world to avoid the drastic lockdown policies and facilitate rapid global economic recovery from this pandemic.","Background A limited set of previous studies suggest musicians may be at higher risk for a unique set of medical and mental health problems. To address the limitations of previous studies, we examined trends in the medical care of musicians in Vanderbilt\u2019s Electronic Health Record research database.","Background Commercial manufacturers have formulated diets to promote not only weight reduction but also to reduce risks of chronic diseases. The objective of this study is to determine if these formulations satisfy requirements for essential nutrients.","Pathway OME (Formerly Pathway Genomics, http://www.pathway.com) has identified a unique set of genetic traits associated with endurance, anxiety and likelihood of hamstring/Achilles injuries in an elite set of marathon runners. To date, this is the largest database of elite marathon athletes to ever have their exomes sequenced. Proprietary SportIQ Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms were developed and used to compare genetic traits in these 1,119 elite marathon runners to a normal population enabling us to develop a \u2018Marathon Runner\u2019 profile to assist athletes in training to compete and achieve their athletic goals. Athlete\u2019s whose genetic profiles differ significantly from the \u201cMarathon Runner\u201d profile will gain additional insights on the specific training necessary to prepare their muscles for the demanding conditions of long distance running.","A novel strain named Meyerozyma guilliermondii GXDK6 was provided in this work, which was confirmed to survive independently under high salt stress (12% NaCl) or co-stress condition of strong acid (pH 3.0) and high salts (10% NaCl) without sterilization. Its survival mechanism under high salt stress was revealed by integrated omics for the first time. Whole-genome analysis showed that 14 genes (e.g., GPD1 and FPS1) of GXDK6 relevant to salt tolerance were annotated and known to belong to various salt-resistant mechanisms (e.g., regulation of cell signal transduction and glycerol metabolism controls). Transcriptome sequencing results indicated that 1220 genes (accounting for 10.15%) of GXDK6 were differentially transcribed (p &lt; 0.05) when GXDK6 growth was under 10% stress for 16 h, including important novel salt-tolerant-related genes (e.g., RTM1 and YHB1). Proteomics analysis demonstrated that 1005 proteins (accounting for 27.26%) of GXDK6 were differentially expressed (p &lt; 0.05) when GXDK6 was stressed by 10% NaCl. Some of the differentially expressed proteins were defined as the novel salt-tolerant related proteins (e.g., sugar transporter STL1 and NADPH-dependent methylglyoxal reductase). Metabolomic analysis results showed that 63 types of metabolites (e.g., D-mannose, glycerol and inositol phosphate) of GXDK6 were up- or downregulated when stressed by 10% NaCl. Among them, D-mannose is one of the important metabolites that could enhance the salt-tolerance survival of GXDK6.","Objective Higher Body Mass Index (BMI) during early life is thought to be a causal risk factor for Multiple Sclerosis (MS). We used longitudinal mendelian randomisation (MR) to determine whether there is a critical window during which BMI influences MS risk.","Although gut microbiota influences osteoporosis risk, the individual species involved, and underlying mechanisms, are unknown. We performed integrative analyses in a Chinese cohort with metagenomics/targeted metabolomics/whole-genome sequencing. Bacteroides vulgatus was found negatively associated with bone mineral density (BMD), this association was validated in US Caucasians. Serum valeric acid was positively associated with BMD, and B.vulgatus causally downregulated it. Ovariectomized mice fed B.vulgatus had decreased bone formation and increased bone resorption, lower BMD and poorer bone micro-structure. Valeric acid suppressed NF-\u03baB p65 protein production (pro-inflammatory), and enhanced IL-10 mRNA expression (anti-inflammatory), leading to suppressed maturation of osteoclast-like cells, and enhanced maturation of osteoblasts in vitro. B.vulgatus and valeric acid represent promising targets for osteoporosis prevention/treatment.","There is a long-standing interest in exploring the relationship between blood-based biomarkers of biological exposures and psychiatric disorders, despite their causal role being difficult to resolve in observational studies. In this study, we leverage genome-wide association study data for a large panel of heritable biochemical traits measured from serum to refine our understanding of causal effect in biochemical-psychiatric trait parings. In accordance with expectation we observed widespread evidence of positive and negative genetic correlation between psychiatric disorders and biochemical traits. We then implemented causal inference to distinguish causation from correlation and found strong evidence that C-reactive protein (CRP) exerts a causal effect on psychiatric disorders, along with other putatively causal relationships involving urate and glucose. Strikingly, these analyses suggested CRP has a protective effect on three disorders including anorexia nervosa, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and schizophrenia, whilst being a risk factor for major depressive disorder. Multivariable models that conditioned CRP effects on interleukin-6 signalling and body mass index suggested that CRP-schizophrenia relationship was not likely mediated by those factors. Collectively, these data suggest that there are shared pathways that influence both biochemical traits and psychiatric illness, including factors such as CRP that are likely to constitute a causal effect and could be targets for therapeutic intervention and precision medicine.","Previous research supports a contribution of early-life immune disturbances in the etiology of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Biomarker studies of the maternal innate (non-adaptive) immune status related to ASD risk have focused on one of the acute phase proteins (APP), C-reactive protein (CRP), with conflicting results. We evaluated levels of eight different APP in maternal serum samples drawn in first trimester, from 318 mothers to ASD-cases and 429 mothers to ASD-unaffected controls, nested within the register-based Stockholm Youth Cohort. Overall, we found no general trend of high levels of maternal APP being associated with increased risk of ASD. In contrast, maternal levels of CRP in the lowest compared to the middle tertile were associated with increased risk of ASD without ID or ADHD in offspring (OR = 2.15, 95 % CI 1.17-3.93). Further, levels of maternal ferritin in the lowest (OR = 1.82, 95 % CI 1.19-2.78) and highest (OR = 1.74, 95 % CI 1.16-2.60) tertiles were associated with increased risk of any ASD diagnosis in offspring, with stronger associations still between the lowest (OR = 3.58, 95 % CI 1.79-7.17) and highest (OR = 3.20, 95 % CI 1.62-6.29) tertiles of ferritin and risk of ASD with ID. The biological interpretation of lower CRP-levels among mothers to ASD-cases is not clear but might be related to the function of the maternal innate immune system. The finding of aberrant levels of ferritin conferring risk of ASD-phenotypes indicates a plausibly important role of iron during neurodevelopment.","Background Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) occurs in the setting of a variety of pathologies including infection and trauma. Some of these patients will further decompensate and require extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) as a palliating maneuver to allow time for recovery of cardiopulmonary function. The molecular mechanisms driving progression from MODS to cardiopulmonary collapse remain incompletely understood, and no biomarkers have been defined to identify those MODS patients at highest risk for progression to requiring ECMO support. We hypothesize that molecular features derived from whole blood transcriptomic profiling either alone or in combination with traditional clinical and laboratory markers can prospectively identify these high risk MODS patients in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU).","The active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D), plays an important immunomodulatory role, regulating transcription of genes in the innate and adaptive immune system. The present study examines patterns of transcriptome-wide response to 1,25D and the bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in primary human monocytes, to elucidate pathways underlying the effects of 1,25D on the immune system. Monocytes obtained from healthy individuals of African-African and European-American ancestry were treated with 1,25D alone or in the presence of LPS, which induced significant up-regulation of genes in the antimicrobial and autophagy pathways, while pro-inflammatory response genes were significantly down-regulated. A joint Bayesian analysis enabled clustering of genes into patterns of shared transcriptional response across treatments. The biological pathways enriched within these expression patterns highlighted several mechanisms through which 1,25D could exert its immunomodulatory role. Pathways such as mTOR signaling, EIF2 signaling, IL-8 signaling and Tec Kinase signaling were enriched among genes with opposite transcriptional responses to 1,25D and LPS, respectively, highlighting the important roles of these pathways in mediating the immunomodulatory activity of 1,25D. Furthermore, a subset of genes with evidence of inter-ethnic differences in transcriptional response was also identified, suggesting that in addition to the well-established inter-ethnic variation in circulating levels of vitamin D, the intensity of transcriptional response to 1,25D and LPS also varies between ethnic groups. We propose that dysregulation of the pathways identified in this study could contribute to immune-mediated disease risk.","  A clear linear correlation of covid-19 surge date with country latitude was\nobserved last autumn 2020, but not with temperature, nor with humidity,\npointing the seasonal vitamin D status decline as a contributor factor. Well\nvaccinated European countries are this autumn 2021 repeating explosive surges.\nWe aim to evaluate the potential link between surge date, country latitude and\npopulation vaccination rate. Only a weak correlation was observed this autumn.\nHowever, after shifting the country latitude towards the south proportionally\nto its vaccination rate, a clear linear correlation was retrieved. This\nobservation, joined to other ones, supports that vitamin D deficiency could\nreduce the vaccination efficiency. There is no objective benefit to hold a\nvitamin D deficiency. Thus, while European populations are undergoing the\nseasonal autumn-winter vitamin D status decline, it already makes sense to\nscreen the elder people vitamin D status and fix individual deficiencies.\n","The germicidal properties of short wavelength ultraviolet C (UVC) light are well established and used to inactivate many viruses and other microbes. However, much less is known about germicidal effects of terrestrial solar UV light, confined exclusively to wavelengths in the UVA and UVB regions. Here, we have explored the sensitivity of the human coronaviruses HCoV-NL63 and SARS-CoV-2 to solar-simulated full spectrum ultraviolet light (sUV) delivered at environmentally relevant doses. First, HCoV-NL63 coronavirus inactivation by sUV-exposure was confirmed employing (i) viral plaque assays, (ii) RT-qPCR detection of viral genome replication, and (iii) infection-induced stress response gene expression array analysis. Next, a detailed dose-response relationship of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus inactivation by sUV was elucidated, suggesting a half maximal suppression of viral infectivity at low sUV doses. Likewise, extended sUV exposure of SARS-CoV-2 blocked cellular infection as revealed by plaque assay and stress response gene expression array analysis. Moreover, comparative (HCoV-NL63 versus SARS-CoV-2) single gene expression analysis by RT-qPCR confirmed that sUV exposure blocks coronavirus-induced redox, inflammatory, and proteotoxic stress responses. Based on our findings, we estimate that solar ground level full spectrum UV light impairs coronavirus infectivity at environmentally relevant doses. Given the urgency and global scale of the unfolding SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, these prototype data suggest feasibility of solar UV-induced viral inactivation, an observation deserving further molecular exploration in more relevant exposure models.","Objective Limited evidence suggests integration of pharmacists into the general practice team could improve medicines management for patients, particularly those with multimorbidity and polypharmacy. This study aimed to develop and assess the feasibility of an intervention involving pharmacists, working within general practices, to optimise prescribing in Ireland.","Using real-world data and past vaccination data, we conducted a large-scale experiment to quantify bias, precision and timeliness of different study designs to estimate historical background (expected) compared to post-vaccination (observed) rates of safety events for several vaccines. We used negative (not causally related) and positive control outcomes. The latter were synthetically generated true safety signals with incident rate ratios ranging from 1.5 to 4.","Background The past decade has seen a substantial rise in the employment of modern data-driven methods to study atopic dermatitis (AD) / eczema.","Dietary supplements (DSs) have been widely used in the U.S. and evaluated in clinical trials as potential interventions for various diseases. However, many clinical trials face challenges in recruiting enough eligible patients in a timely fashion, causing delays or even early termination. Using electronic health records to find eligible patients who meet clinical trial eligibility criteria has been shown as a promising way to assess recruitment feasibility and accelerate the recruitment process. In this study, we analyzed the eligibility criteria of 100 randomly selected DS clinical trials and identified both computable and non-computable criteria. We mapped annotated entities to OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) with novel entities (e.g., DS). We also evaluated a deep learning model (Bi-LSTM-CRF) for extracting these entities on CLAMP platform, with an average F1 measure of 0.601. This study shows the feasibility of automatic parsing of the eligibility criteria following OMOP CDM for future cohort identification.","Genome-wide association studies have identified hundreds of signals for type 2 diabetes (T2D), most of which confer risk through effects on gene expression. We previously identified the transcription factor ZMIZ1 as a probable effector transcript in human islets, but how altered ZMIZ1  expression impacts T2D risk is unknown. We now show that islets from carriers of the T2D-risk alleles have reduced islet insulin content and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. To elucidate the mechanism for islet-cell dysfunction, we generated \u03b2-cell-specific Zmiz1 knockout (Zmiz1\u03b2KO) mice. Male and female Zmiz1\u03b2KO mice were glucose intolerant with impaired insulin secretion, compared with control littermates. Transcriptomic profiling of Zmiz1\u03b2KO islets identified over 500 differentially expressed genes including those involved in \u03b2-cell function and maturity which we confirmed at the protein level. After high fat feeding, Zmiz1\u03b2KO mice fail to expand \u03b2-cell mass and become severely diabetic. Thus, Zmiz1 is required for normal glucose homeostasis and may contribute to T2D risk by maintaining a mature \u03b2-cell state and allowing islet mass expansion upon metabolic stress.","Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME) /Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is a severely debilitating and complex illness of uncertain aetiology, affecting the lives of millions and characterised by prolonged fatigue. The initiating factors and mechanisms leading to chronic debilitating muscle fatigue in ME/CFS are unknown and are complicated by the time required for diagnosis. Both mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation have been proposed to be central to the pathogenesis of ME/CFS. This original and extensive study demonstrated that although there was little dysfunction evident in the muscle mitochondria of patients with ME/CFS, particular blood plasma and skeletal muscle cytokines, when adjusted for age, gender and cytokine interactions could predict both diagnosis and a number of measures common to patients with ME/CFS. These included MVC and perceived fatigue as well as cognitive indices such as pattern and verbal reaction times. We employed advanced multivariate analyses to cytokine profiles that leverages covariation and intrinsic redundancy to identify patterns of immune signaling that can be evaluated for their predictions of disease phenotype. The current study identified discriminatory cytokine profiles that can be sufficiently used to distinguish HCs from patients with ME/CFS and provides compelling evidence that a limited number of cytokines are associated with diagnosis and fatigue. Moreover, this study demonstrates significant potential of using multiplex cytokine profiles and bioinformatics as diagnostic tools for ME/CFS, potentiating the possibility of not only diagnosis, but also being able to individually personalise therapies.","Purpose Genome sequencing (GS) is potentially the most suitable diagnostic tools for fetal CNS structural anomalies. However, its efficacy hasn\u2019t been proved in large cohort of fetal CNS structural anomalies.","Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) is a rare disease caused by the obliteration of the pulmonary arterioles, increasing pulmonary vascular resistance and eventually causing right heart failure. Endothelin-1 is a vasoconstrictor peptide whose levels are indicators of disease progression and its pathway is one of the commonest targeted by current treatments.","Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common degenerative joint disease, and joint injury increases the risk of OA by 10-fold. Although the injury event itself damages joint tissues, a substantial amount of secondary damage is mediated by the cellular responses to the injury. Cellular responses include the production and activation of proteases (MMPs, ADAMTSs, Cathepsins), the production of inflammatory cytokines, and we hypothesize, changes to the joint metabolome. The trajectory of cellular responses is driven by the transcriptional activation of early response genes, which requires Cdk9-dependent RNA Polymerase II phosphorylation. Flavopiridol is a potent and selective inhibitor of Cdk9 kinase activity, which prevents the transcriptional activation of early response genes. To model post-traumatic osteoarthritis, we subjected mice to non-invasive ACL-rupture joint injury. Following injury, mice were treated with flavopiridol to inhibit Cdk9-dependent transcriptional activation, or vehicle control. Global joint metabolomics were analyzed 1 hour after injury. We found that injury induced metabolomic changes, including increases in Vitamin D3 metabolism and others. Importantly, we found that inhibition of primary response gene activation at the time of injury largely prevented the global changes in the metabolomics profiles. Cluster analysis of joint metabolomes identified groups of injury-induced and drug-responsive metabolites, which may offer novel targets for cell-mediated secondary joint damage. Metabolomic profiling provides an instantaneous snapshot of biochemical activity representing cellular responses, and these data demonstrate the potential for inhibition of early response genes to alter the trajectory of cell-mediated degenerative changes following joint injury.","Links between solar UV exposure and immunity date back to the ancient Greeks with the development of heliotherapy. Skin contains several UV-sensitive chromophores and exposure to sunlight can produce molecules, such as vitamin D3, that act in an endocrine manner. We investigated whether the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), an environmental sensor and ligand-regulated transcription factor activated by numerous planar compounds of dietary or environmental origin, could be the target of endocrine photoproducts produced by cutaneous UV exposure. 15-to 30-minute exposure of cells to a minimal erythemal dose of UVB irradiation in vitro induced translocation of the AHR to the nucleus, rapidly inducing site-specific DNA binding and target gene regulation. Importantly, ex vivo studies with Ahr wild-type or null fibroblasts showed that serum from mice whose skin was exposed to a 15 min UVB dose, but not control serum, contained agonist activity within 30 min of UV irradiation, inducing AHR-dependent gene expression. Moreover, a 15-min cutaneous UVB exposure induced AHR site-specific DNA binding and target gene regulation in vivo within 3-6 hr post-irradiation in blood and in peripheral tissues, including intestine. These results show that cutaneous exposure of mice to a single minimal erythemic dose of UVB induces rapid AHR signaling in multiple peripheral organs, providing compelling evidence that moderate sun exposure can exert endocrine control of immunity through the AHR.","Background Currently, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common chronic liver diseases in the world. Forecasting the short-term, up to 2025, NASH due to fibrosis is one of the leading causes of liver transplantation. Cohort studies revealed that non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) has a higher risk of fibrosis progression among NAFLD patients. Identifying differentially expressed genes helps to determine NASH pathogenic pathways, make more accurate diagnoses, and prescribe appropriate treatment.","With the evolution of multicellularity, communication among cells in different organs/tissues became pivotal to life. Molecular basis of such communication has long been studied, but genome-wide screens for biomolecules/genes mediating tissue-tissue signaling are lacking. To systematically identify inter-tissue mediators, we present a novel computational approach MultiCens (Multilayer/Multi-tissue network Centrality measures). Unlike single-layer network methods, MultiCens can distinguish within- vs. across-layer connectivity to quantify the \u201cinfluence\u201d of any gene in a tissue on a query set of genes of interest in another tissue. MultiCens enjoys theoretical guarantees on convergence and decomposability, and excels on synthetic benchmarks. On human multi-tissue datasets, MultiCens predicts known and novel genes linked to hormones. MultiCens further reveals shifts in gene network architecture among four brain regions in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. MultiCens-prioritized hypotheses from these two diverse applications, and potential future ones like \u201cMulti-tissue-expanded Gene Ontology\u201d analysis, can enable whole-body yet molecular-level investigations in humans.","We recently reported genetic variants associated with birth weight and their effect on future cardiometabolic risk in Europeans. Despite a higher burden of low birth weight and cardiometabolic disorders, such studies are lacking in South Asians. We generated fetal and maternal genetic scores (fGS and mGS) from 196 birth weight-associated variants identified in Europeans and conducted association analysis with various birth measures and serially measured anthropometric and cardiometabolic traits from seven Indian and Bangladeshi cohorts. Although fGS and mGS were comparable to Europeans, birth weight was substantially smaller suggesting strong environmental constraints on fetal growth in South Asians. Birth weight increased by 50.7g and 33.6g per standard deviation fGS (P=9.1\u00d710\u221211) and mGS (P=0.003) in South Asians. The fGS was further associated with childhood body size and head circumference, fasting glucose, and triglycerides in adults (P&lt;0.01). Our study supports a common genetic mechanism partly explaining associations between early development and later cardiometabolic health in different populations, despite phenotypic and environmental differences.","Articular cartilage has only very limited regenerative capacities in humans. Tissue engineering techniques for cartilage damage repair are limited in the production of hyaline cartilage. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) are multipotent stem cells and can be differentiated into mature cartilage cells, chondrocytes, which could be used for repairing damaged cartilage. Chondrogenesis is a highly complex, relatively inefficient process lasting over 3 weeks in vitro. In order to better understand chondrogenic differentiation, especially the commitment phase, we have performed transcriptional profiling of MSC differentiation into chondrocytes from early timepoints starting 15 minutes after induction to 16 hours and fully differentiated chondrocytes at 21 days. Transcriptional gene regulatory networks (GRN) were identified using time-course clustering and upstream-regulator predictions which revealed that cells start epigenetic reprogramming as early as 2 hours after induction and commit to differentiation within 4-6 hours. After that they adapt their gene expression to cater for differentiation specific protein production. These results suggest that interventions to improve the frequency and efficiency of differentiation should target early processes.","Colonoid cultures were established from histologically-normal human colon tissue and maintained in a low-calcium (0.25 mM) medium or in medium supplemented with an amount of calcium (1.5 - 3.0 mM) that was shown in a previous study to induce differentiation in colonoids derived from large adenomas. Calcium alone was compared to Aquamin, a multi-mineral natural product that contains magnesium and detectable levels of 72 additional trace elements in addition to calcium. Unlike the previously-studied tumor-derived colonoids (which remained un-differentiated in the absence of calcium-supplementation), normal tissue colonoids underwent differentiation as indicated by gross and microscopic appearance, a low proliferative index and high-level expression of cytokeratin 20 (CK20) in the absence of intervention. Only modest additional changes were seen in these parameters with either calcium alone or Aquamin (providing up to 3.0 mM calcium). In spite of this, proteomic analysis and immunohistochemistry revealed that both interventions induced strong up-regulation of proteins that promote cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesive functions, barrier formation and tissue integrity. Transmission electron microscopy revealed an increase in desmosomes in response to intervention. These findings demonstrate that histologically normal human colonoids can undergo differentiation in the presence of a low ambient calcium concentration. However, higher calcium levels can induce elaboration of proteins that promote cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion. These changes could lead to improved barrier function and improved colon tissue health.","Osteocyte produced fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is the key regulator of serum phosphate (Pi) homeostasis. The interplay between parathyroid hormone (PTH), FGF23 and other proteins that regulate FGF23 production and serum Pi levels is complex and incompletely characterised. Evidence suggests that the protein product of the SOST gene, sclerostin (SCL), also a PTH target and also produced by osteocytes, plays a role in FGF23 expression, however the mechanism for this effect is unclear. Part of the problem of understanding the interplay of these mediators is the complex multi-organ system that achieves Pi homeostasis in vivo. In the current study, we sought to address this using a unique cell line model of the osteocyte, IDG-SW3, known to express FGF23 at both the mRNA and protein levels. In cultures of differentiated IDG-SW3 cells, both PTH1-34 and recombinant human (rh) SCL remarkably induced Fgf23 mRNA expression dose-dependently within 3 hours. Both rhPTH1-34 and rhSCL also strongly induced C-terminal FGF23 protein secretion. Secreted intact FGF23 levels remained unchanged, consistent with constitutive post-translational cleavage of FGF23 in this cell model. Both rhPTH1-34 and rhSCL treatments significantly suppressed mRNA levels of Phex, Dmp1 and Enpp1 mRNA, encoding putative negative regulators of FGF23 levels, and induced Galnt3 mRNA expression, encoding N-acetylgalactosaminyl-transferase 3 (GalNAc-T3), which protects FGF23 from furin-like proprotein convertase-mediated cleavage. The effect of both rhPTH1-34 and rhSCL was antagonised by pre-treatment with the NF-\u03ba\u03b2 signalling inhibitors, BAY11 and TPCK. RhSCL also stimulated FGF23 mRNA expression in ex vivo cultures of human bone. These findings provide evidence for the direct regulation of FGF23 expression by sclerostin. Locally expressed sclerostin via the induction of FGF23 in osteocytes thus has the potential to contribute to the regulation of Pi homeostasis.","REV-ERB\u03b1 is a nuclear hormone receptor that plays important role in the regulation of many physiological processes such as circadian clock regulation, inflammation, and metabolism. Despite its importance, few chemical tools are available to study this receptor. In addition, there is no available X-ray crystal structures of REV-ERB bound with synthetic ligands, hampering the development of targeted therapeutics. SR8278 is the only identified synthetic antagonist of REV-ERB. We have performed Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (GaMD) simulations to sample the binding pathway of SR8278 and associated conformational changes to REV-ERB\u03b1. The simulations revealed a novel and more energetically favorable conformational state than the starting conformation. The new conformation allows ligand binding to the orthosteric binding site in a specific orientation. This state is reached after a tryptophan (Trp436) rotameric switch coupled with H3-H6 distance change. We used the newly identified GaMD conformational state in structure-based virtual screening of one million compounds library which led to the identification of novel REV-ERB\u03b1 antagonist. This study is the first that demonstrates a synthetic ligand binding pathway to REV-ERB\u03b1, which provided important insights into the REV-ERB\u03b1 functional mechanism and lead to the discovery of novel REV-ERB\u03b1 antagonists. This study further emphasizes the power of computational chemistry methods in advancing drug discovery research.","Hematopoiesis changes over life to meet the demands of maturation and aging. Here, we find that the definitive hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) compartment is remodeled from gestation into adulthood, a process regulated by the heterochronic Lin28b/let-7 axis. Native fetal and neonatal HSPCs distribute with a pro-lymphoid/erythroid bias with a shift toward myeloid output in adulthood. By mining transcriptomic data comparing juvenile and adult HSPCs and reconstructing coordinately activated gene regulatory networks, we uncover the Polycomb repressor complex 1 (PRC1) component Cbx2 as an effector of Lin28b/let-7\u2019s control of hematopoietic maturation. We find that juvenile Cbx2-/- hematopoietic tissues show impairment of B-lymphopoiesis and a precocious adult-like myeloid bias and that Cbx2/PRC1 regulates developmental timing of expression of key hematopoietic transcription factors. These findings define a novel mechanism of epigenetic regulation of HSPC output as a function of age with potential impact on age-biased pediatric and adult blood disorders.","Mediator of Cell Motility 1 (MEMO1) is an ubiquitously expressed modulator of cellular responses to growth factors including FGF23 signaling, and Memo1-deficient mice share some phenotypic traits with Fgf23- or Klotho-deficient mouse models. Here, we tested whether Memo1 gene expression is regulated by calciotropic hormones or by changing the dietary mineral load.","The present study presents a view on exploring the relationship pattern between COVID 19 daily cases with weather parameters and air pollutants in mainland India. We consider mean temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, rainfall, wind speed, PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2 and CO as independent variable and daily COVID 19 cases as dependent variable for 18 states during 18th march to 30th April, 2020.After dividing the dataset for 0 to 10 day, 10 to 25 days and 0 to 44 days, the current study applied Akaike s Information Criteria (AIC) and Generalized Additive Model (GAM) to examine the kind of relationship between independent variables with COVID 19 cases. Initially GAM model result shows variables like temperature and solar radiation has positive relation (p&lt;0.05) in 0 to 10 days study with daily cases. In 25 days dataset it significantly shows that temperature has positive relation above 23 degree centigrade, SO2 has a negative relationship and relative humidity has negative (between 30% to 45% and &gt; 60%) and a positive relationship (45% to 60%) with COVID 19 cases (p=0.05). 44 days dataset has six parameters includes temperature as positive, relative humidity as negative (between 0 to 45%) and then positive (after &gt;45%), NO2 as Positive (0 to 35 microgram/m3) followed by negative trend (after &gt; 40 microgram/m3), SO2 and rainfall as negative relation. After sensitive analysis, it is found that weather variables like relative humidity, solar radiation and rainfall are more sensitive than temperature and wind speed. Whereas pollutants like NO2, PM2.5, PM10 and CO are more sensitive variables than SO2 in this study. In summary this study finds temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, wind speed, SO2, PM2.5, and CO may be important factors associated with COVID 19 pandemic.","Behavioral genetics and cultural evolution have both revolutionized our understanding of human behavior, but largely independently of each other. Here we reconcile these two fields using a dual inheritance approach, which offers a more nuanced understanding of the interaction between genes and culture, and a resolution to several long-standing puzzles. For example, by neglecting how human environments are extensively shaped by cultural dynamics, behavioral genetic approaches systematically inflate heritability estimates and thereby overestimate the genetic basis of human behavior. A WEIRD (Western, educated, industrialized, rich, democratic) gene problem obscures this inflation. Considering both genetic and cultural evolutionary forces, heritability scores become less a property of a trait and more a moving target that responds to cultural and social changes. Ignoring cultural evolutionary forces leads to an over-simplified model of gene-to-phenotype causality. When cumulative culture functionally overlaps with genes, genetic effects become masked, or even reversed, and the causal effect of an identified gene is confounded with features of the cultural environment, specific to a particular society at a particular time. This framework helps explain why it is easier to discover genes for deficiencies than genes for abilities. With this framework, we predict the ways in which heritability should differ between societies, between socioeconomic levels within some societies but not others, and over the life course. An integrated cultural evolutionary behavioral genetics cuts through the nature\u2013nurture debate and elucidates controversial topics such as general intelligence.","Multifactorial metabolic diseases, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, are a major burden of modern societies and frequently present with no clearly defined molecular biomarkers. Herein we used systems medicine approaches to decipher signatures of liver fibrosis in mouse models with malfunction in genes from unrelated biological pathways. Enrichment analyses of KEGG, Reactome and TRANSFAC databases complemented with genome-scale metabolic modelling revealed fibrotic signatures highly similar to liver pathologies in humans. The diverse genetic models of liver fibrosis exposed a common transcriptional programme with activated ER\u03b1 signalling, and a network of interactions between regulators of lipid metabolism and transcription factors from cancer pathways and immune system. The novel hallmarks of fibrosis are downregulated lipid pathways, including fatty acid, bile acid, and steroid hormone metabolism. Moreover, distinct metabolic subtypes of liver fibrosis were proposed, supported by unique enrichment of transcription factors based on the type of insult, disease stage, or sex.","Background Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) of human fecal samples to germ-free (GF) mice is useful for establishing causal relationships between gut microbiota and human phenotypes. However, due to intrinsic differences between human and mouse intestines and distinct diets between the two organisms, replicating human phenotypes in mouse through FMT is not guaranteed; similarly, treatments that are effective in mouse models do not guarantee their success in human either.","Background Sleep apnoea is a disorder characterised by periods of halted breathing during sleep. Despite its association with severe health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, liver problems and metabolic syndrome, the aetiology of sleep apnoea remain understudied, and previous genetic analyses have not identified many robustly associated genetic risk variants.","Dysregulation of Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling may contribute to multiple Down syndrome-associated phenotypes, including cerebellar hypoplasia, congenital heart defects, craniofacial and skeletal dysmorphologies, and Hirschsprung disease. Granule cell precursors isolated from the developing cerebellum of Ts65Dn mice are less responsive to the mitogenic effects of SHH than euploid cells, and a single postnatal dose of the SHH pathway agonist SAG rescues cerebellar morphology and performance on learning and memory tasks in Ts65Dn mice. SAG treatment also normalizes expression levels of OLIG2 in neural progenitor cells derived from human trisomy 21 iPSCs. However, despite evidence that activating SHH signaling can ameliorate some Down syndrome-associated phenotypes, chromosome 21 does not encode any components of the canonical SHH pathway. Here, we screened 163 chromosome 21 cDNAs in a series of SHH-responsive cell lines to identify chromosome 21 genes that modulate SHH signaling. We confirmed overexpression of trisomic candidate genes using RNA-seq in Ts65Dn and TcMAC21 cerebellum. Our study indicates that some chromosome 21 genes, including DYRK1A, upregulate SHH signaling while others, such as HMGN1 and MIS18A, inhibit SHH signaling. Overexpression of genes involved in chromatin structure and mitosis, but not genes previously implicated in ciliogenesis, regulate the SHH pathway. Our data suggest that cerebellar hypoplasia and other phenotypes related to aberrant SHH signaling arise from the net effect of trisomy for multiple chromosome 21 genes rather than the overexpression of a single trisomic gene. Identifying which chromosome 21 genes modulate SHH signaling may suggest new therapeutic avenues for ameliorating Down syndrome phenotypes.","Transcription factors (TFs) are crucial for regulating cell differentiation during the development of the immune system. However, the key TFs for orchestrating the specification of distinct immune cells are not fully understood. Here, we integrated the transcriptomic and epigenomic measurements in 73 mouse and 61 human primary cell types, respectively, that span the immune cell differentiation pathways. We constructed the cell-type-specific transcriptional regulatory network and assessed the global importance of TFs based on the Taiji framework, which is a method we have previously developed that can infer the global impact of TFs using integrated transcriptomic and epigenetic data. Integrative analysis across cell types revealed putative driver TFs in cell lineage-specific differentiation in both mouse and human systems. We have also identified TF combinations that play important roles in specific developmental stages. Furthermore, we validated the functions of predicted novel TFs in murine CD8+ T cell differentiation and showed the importance of Elf1 and Prdm9 in the effector versus memory T cell fate specification and Kdm2b and Tet3 in promoting differentiation of CD8+ tissue resident memory (Trm) cells, validating the approach. Thus, we have developed a bioinformatic approach that provides a global picture of the regulatory mechanisms that govern cellular differentiation in the immune system and aids the discovery of novel mechanisms in cell fate decisions.","The virus causing COVID-19 has spread rapidly worldwide and threatens millions of lives. It remains unknown if summer weather will reduce its continued spread, thereby alleviating strains on hospitals and providing time for vaccine development. Early insights from laboratory studies of related coronaviruses predicted that COVID-19 would decline at higher temperatures, humidity, and ultraviolet light. Using current, fine-scaled weather data and global reports of infection we developed a model that explained 36% of variation in early growth rates before intervention, with 17% based on weather or demography and 19% based on country-specific effects. We found that ultraviolet light was most strongly associated with lower COVID-19 growth rates. Projections suggest that, in the absence of intervention, COVID-19 will decrease temporarily during summer, rebound by autumn, and peak next winter. However, uncertainty remains high and the probability of a weekly doubling rate remained &gt;20% throughout the summer in the absence of control. Consequently, aggressive policy interventions will likely be needed in spite of seasonal trends.","Psychiatric disorders are complex, heritable, and highly polygenic. Supported by findings of abnormalities in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) based measures of brain connectivity, current theoretical and empirical accounts have conceptualized them as disorders of brain connectivity and dysfunctional integration of brain signaling, however, the extent to which these findings reflect common genetic factors remains unclear. Here, we performed a multivariate genome-wide association analysis of fMRI-based functional brain connectivity in a sample of 30,701 individuals from the UK Biobank and investigated the shared genetic determinants with seven major psychiatric disorders. The analysis revealed significant genetic overlap between functional brain connectivity and schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, anxiety, and major depression, adding further genetic support for the dysconnectivity hypothesis of psychiatric disorders and identifying potential genetic and functional targets for future studies.","Aim To investigate the difference in both numbers and acuity of presentations to the Paediatric Emergency Department (PED) during the peak time period of the current global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Rationale Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) has a devastating impact on global health. Mtb is the causative agent of human pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), which claims 1.4 million lives per annum. During infection, differentially culturable bacilli (DCB) that fail to produce colonies on solid media but grow in liquid media supplemented with resuscitation-promoting factor (Rpf) proteins are formed. These Rpf-dependent mycobacteria are a major barrier to developing improved TB treatments and diagnostic tools.","Human Angiotensin I Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) that acts as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry is highly expressed in human type II pneumocytes and enterocytes and similarly in other mammals and zebrafish (Danio rerio). The zebrafish genome has a highly conserved, one-to-one ortholog of ACE2, i.e., ace2, whose expression profile however has not yet been studied during development or in pathologies relevant to COVID-19. Herein, we identified significant development-, tissue- and gender-specific modulations in ace2 expression based on meta-analysis of zebrafish Affymetrix transcriptomics datasets (ndatasets=107, GPL1319 in GEO database). Co-expression network analysis of ace2 revealed distinct positively correlated (carboxypeptidase activity and fibrin clot formation), and negatively correlated (cilia biogenesis/transport and chromatin modifications) STRING network modules. Using additional transcriptomics datasets, we showed zebrafish embryos before 3 days post fertilization (dpf) exhibited low levels of ace2 that increased significantly until 4 dpf implicating a role for ace2 in organogenesis. Re-analysis of RNA-seq datasets from zebrafish adult tissues demonstrated ace2 was expressed highly in intestines, variably in liver, and at lower levels in other organs. In addition, zebrafish females and males showed significant dimorphism in their age-dependent expression of ace2, and between ovary and testis where the latter had higher levels. Moreover, we demonstrated ace2 expression was significantly modulated under different physiological and pathological conditions associated with development, diet, infection, and inflammation. Our findings implicate a novel translational role for zebrafish ace2 in differentiation and pathologies predominantly found in intestines and liver, in which the effects of SARS-CoV-2 could be detrimental.","A significant portion of bone fractures fail to heal properly, increasing healthcare costs. Advances in fracture management have slowed because translational barriers have limited generation of mechanism-based explanations for the healing process. When uncertainties are numerous, analogical modeling can be an effective strategy for developing plausible explanations of complex phenomena. We demonstrate the feasibility of engineering analogical models in software to provide plausible biomimetic explanations for how fracture healing may progress. Concrete analogical models \u2013 Callus Analogs \u2013 were created using the MASON simulation toolkit. We designated a Target Region initial state within a characteristic tissue section of mouse tibia fracture at day-7 and posited a corresponding day-10 Target Region final state. The goal was to discover a coarse-grain analog mechanism that would enable the discretized initial state to transform itself into the corresponding Target Region final state, thereby providing a new way to study the healing process. One of nine quasi-autonomous Tissue Unit types is assigned to each grid space, which maps to an 80\u00d780 \u00b5m region of the tissue section. All Tissue Units have an opportunity each time step to act based on individualized logic, probabilities, and information about adjacent neighbors. Action causes transition from one Tissue Unit type to another, and simulation through several thousand time steps generates a coarse-grain analog \u2013 a theory \u2013 of the healing process. We prespecified a minimum measure of success: simulated and actual Target Region states achieve \u2265 70% Similarity. We used an iterative protocol to explore many combinations of Tissue Unit logic and action constraints. Workflows progressed through four stages of analog mechanisms. Similarities of 73-90% were achieved for Mechanisms 2-4. The range of Upper-Level similarities increased to 83-94% when we allowed for uncertainty about two Tissue Unit designations. We have demonstrated how Callus Analog experiments provide domain experts with a new medium and tools for thinking about and understanding the fracture healing process.","Highly pathogenic respiratory viruses such as 1918 influenza (HIN1) and coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) induce significant lung injury with diffuse alveolar damage, capillary leak, and extensive cell death resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Direct effects of the virus, as well as host immune response such as proinflammatory cytokine production, contribute to programmed cell death or apoptosis. Alveolar lung epithelial type II (AT2) cells play a major role in the clearance of respiratory viruses, secretion of surfactant proteins and antimicrobial substances into the bronchoalveolar fluid as well as repair of lung injury. Gene expression in AT2 cells is regulated in a tissue and cell-specific manner and in a temporal fashion. The availability of tissue and cell-specific RNA datasets in Human Protein Atlas led to the identification of localized expression patterns of BCL-2 family members such as BCL2 related protein A1 (BCL2A1) in AT2 cells and immune cells of the lung. BCL2A1 expression was regulated by multiple stimuli including Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands, interferons (IFNs), inflammatory cytokines, and inhibited by the steroid dexamethasone. In this study, regulation of BCL2A1 gene expression in human lung epithelial cells by several respiratory viruses and type I interferon signaling was investigated. SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly induced BCL2A1 expression in human lung epithelial cells within 24 hours that required the expression of Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). BCL2A1 mRNA induction by SARS-CoV-2 was correlated with the induced expression of IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-regulated transcription factor mRNA. BCL2A1 was induced by IFN-\u03b2 treatment or by infection with influenza virus lacking the non-structural protein1(NS1) in NHBE cells. Furthermore, bioinformatics revealed that a subset of BCL-2 family members involved in the control of apoptosis and transcription such as BCL2A1, BCL2L14, BCL3, and BCL6 were regulated in the lung epithelial cells by coronaviruses and in the lung tissue samples of COVID-19 patients. Transcriptomic data also suggested that these genes were differentially regulated by the steroid drug dexamethasone.","Despite advances in cancer treatments, early detection of cancer is still the most promising way to improve outcomes. Without homeostatic control, urine reflects early changes in the body and can potentially be used for early cancer diagnosis. In this study, a Walker 256 tumor rat model was established by subcutaneous injection of Walker 256 tumor cells. To identify urinary proteome changes during cancer development, urine samples from Walker 256 tumor-bearing rats were collected at five time points corresponding to before cancer cell implantation, before tumor mass palpability, at tumor mass appearance, during rapid tumor growth, and at cachexia. The urinary protein patterns changed significantly as the tumors progressed, as measured using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The urinary proteome of tumor-bearing rats was identified using Fusion Lumos mass spectrometry with label-free quantification. Then, 30 dynamically changed urinary proteins during cancer progression were selected as more reliable cancer biomarkers, and they were validated by targeted proteomics. Combined with the results of label-free and targeted proteome quantification, a total of 10 urinary proteins (HPT, APOA4, CO4, B2MG, A1AG, CATC, VCAM1, CALB1, CSPG4, and VTDB) changed significantly even before a tumor mass was palpable, and these early changes in urine could also be identified with differential abundance at late stages of cancer. Our study indicated that urine is a sensitive biomarker source for early detection of cancer.","Calorie restriction (CR) slows aging and increases healthy lifespan in model organisms. We tested if CR slowed biological aging in humans using DNA methylation analysis of blood samples from N=197 participants in the Comprehensive Assessment of Long-term Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy (CALERIE\u2122) randomized controlled trial. We quantified CR effects on biological aging by comparing change scores for six epigenetic-clock and Pace-of-Aging measures between n=128 CR-group and n=69 ad-libitum-control-group participants at 12- and 24-month follow-ups. CR effects were strongest for DunedinPACE Pace of Aging (12-month Cohen\u2019s d=0.3; 24-month Cohen\u2019s d=0.2, p&lt;0.01 for both), followed by DunedinPoAm and the GrimAge epigenetic clock, although effects for these measures were not statistically different from zero (p&gt;0.08). CR effects for other epigenetic clocks were in the opposite direction (all p&gt;0.15). CALERIE intervention slowed Pace of Aging but showed minimal effect on epigenetic clocks hypothesized to reflect longer term accumulation of aging burden.","Murine models describe a defined host/pathogen interaction for urinary tract infection, but human cell studies are scant. Although recent human urothelial organoid models are promising, none demonstrate long-term tolerance to urine, the natural substrate of the tissue and of the uropathogens that live there. We developed a novel human organoid from progenitor cells which demonstrates key structural hallmarks and biomarkers of the urothelium. After three weeks of transwell culture with 100% urine at the apical interface, the organoid stratified into multiple layers. The apical surface differentiated into enlarged and flattened umbrella-like cells bearing characteristic tight junctions, structures resembling asymmetric unit membrane plaques, and a glycosaminoglycan layer. The apical cells also expressed apical cytokeratin-20, a spatial feature of the mammalian urothelium. Urine itself was necessary for full development, and undifferentiated cells were urine-tolerant despite the lack of membrane plaques and a glycosaminoglycan layer. Infection with Enterococcus faecalis revealed the expected invasive outcome, including urothelial sloughing and the formation of intracellular colonies similar to those previously observed in patient cells. This new biomimetic model could help illuminate invasive behaviours of uropathogens, and serve as a reproducible test bed for disease formation, treatment and resolution in patients.","Age-related frailty is a significant health and social care burden, however treatment options are limited. There is currently a lack of suitable cell culture model for screening large numbers of test compounds to identifying those which can potentially promote healthy skeletal muscle function. This paper describes the characterization of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) signalling changes in young and aged myoblasts and myotubes using the C2C12 cell line, and the application of aged myoblast and myotube cultures to assess the effect of dietary polyphenols on RONS signalling. Aged myoblasts and myotubes were observed to have significantly increased reactive oxygen species levels (p&lt;0.01 and p&lt;0.001 respectively), increases in nitric oxide levels (p&lt;0.05 for myoblasts and myotubes), and lipid peroxidation markers (p&lt;0.05 for myoblasts and myotubes). A panel of nine polyphenols were assessed in aged myoblasts and myotubes using concentrations and incubation times consistent with known pharmacokinetic parameters for these compounds. Of these, although several polyphenols were seen to reduce single markers of RONS signalling, only kaempferol and resveratrol consistently reduced multiple markers of RONS signalling with statistical significance in both cell models. Modulation of cellular enzymatic antioxidant activities (superoxide and catalase) was assessed as a possible mechanism of action for these polyphenols, and although both superoxide and catalase activities were significantly reduced in aged (versus young) myotubes (p&lt;0.01 and p&lt;0.05 respectively), no effect of polyphenol treatment on these enzyme activities were observed. Overall, this research has shown the utility of the C2C12 model, as both myoblasts and myotubes, as a suitable cell model for screening compounds for modulating RONS signalling in aged muscle, and that resveratrol and kaempferol (using pharmacokinetically-informed exposures) can modulate RONS signalling in skeletal muscle cells after an acute exposure.","Staphylococcus aureus infections pose a potential threat to livestock production and public health. A novel strategy is needed to control S. aureus infection due to its adaptive evolution to antibiotics. Autophagy plays a key role in degrading bacteria for innate immune cells. In order to promote S. aureus clearance via TLR induced autophagy pathway, the domain fusion TLR2-4 with the extracellular domain of TLR2, specific recognizing S. aureus, and transmembrane and intracellular domains of TLR4 is assembled, then the goats expressing TLR2-4 is generated. TLR2-4 substantially augments the removal of S. aureus within macrophages by elevating autophagy level. Phosphorylated JNK/ERK1/2 promote LC3- puncta in TLR2-4 macrophages during S. aureus-induced autophagy via MyD88-mediated the TAK1 signaling cascade. Meantime, the TRIF-dependent TBK1-TFEB-OPTN signaling is involved in TLR2-4-triggered autophagy after S. aureus challenge. Moreover, the transcript of ATG5 and ATG12 is significantly increased via cAMP-PKA-NF-\u03baB signaling, which facilitates S. aureus-induced autophagy in TLR2-4 macrophages. Overall, the novel receptor TLR2-4 enhances the autophagy-dependent clearance of S. aureus in macrophages via TAK1/TBK1-JNK/ERK, TBK1-TFEB-OPTN and cAMP-PKA-NF-\u03baB-ATGs signaling pathways, which provide an alternative approach to resistant against S. aureus infection.","Introduction Emerging evidence suggests that fast-track and enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) targeting modifiable risk factors reduce complications after total hip (THR) and knee replacement (TKR). However, what constitutes an effective preoperative optimisation protocol for THR and TKR remains unclear. The aims are to: (1) describe pre-operative optimisation protocols for THR and TKR; (2) evaluate the effects of pre-operative optimisation protocols for THR and TKR on morbidity, and patient-reported outcomes.","Background Epithermal instrumental neutron activation analysis (EINAA) technique is used for the determination and estimation of the concentration levels of micronutrients such as Sodium (Na), Magnesium (Mg), Potassium (K), Calcium (Ca), Manganese (Mn), Copper (Cu) and Iodine (I) in breastmilk.","Many aquatically respiring animals inhabiting low pH waters can suffer acute inhibition of ion uptake and loss of branchial (gill) epithelial integrity, culminating in a fatal, rapid loss of body Na+. Environmental calcium levels ([Ca2+]e) are pivotal in maintaining branchial junction integrity, with supplemental Ca2+ reversing the negative effects of low pH in some animals. Tolerance of some naturally acidic environments by aquatic animals is further complicated by low [Ca2+]e, yet many of these environments are surprisingly biodiverse. How these animals overcome the combined damaging actions of low pH and low environmental Ca2+ remains unknown. Here, we examined the effects of [Ca2+]e on the response to low pH in larvae of the highly acid tolerant frog Limnodynastes terraereginae. Acute exposure to low pH water in the presence of low [Ca2+]e increased net Na+ efflux. Provision of additional [Ca2+]e reduced net Na+ efflux, but the effect was saturable. Acclimation to both low and high [Ca2+]e improved the resistance of larvae to Na+ efflux at low pH. Inhibition of apical Ca2+ uptake by ruthenium red resulted in an abrupt loss of tolerance to low pH in larvae acclimated to low pH water. Acclimation to acidic water increased branchial gene expression of the intracellular Ca2+ transport protein calbindin, consistent with a role for increased transcellular Ca2+ trafficking in the tolerance of acidic water. This study confirmed the physiological challenge of low [Ca2+]e on branchial integrity in acidic waters and highlighted a potential role for maintenance of transcellular Ca2+ uptake in the acid tolerance of L. terraereginae.","The report provides an up-to-date review of the global effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in care homes. We used a mixed methods approach to assess care home mortality by country, how the deaths compared with previous periods, and how excess deaths may be explained. We retrieved national datasets for 25 countries on mortality, 17 cohort studies assessing deaths compared to a previous period, and 16 cohort studies reporting interventions or factors associated with excess mortality.","Stratified medicine requires discretisation of disease populations for targeted treatments. We have developed and applied a discrete Morse theory clustering algorithm to a Topological Data Analysis (TDA) network model of 498 gene expression profiles of peripheral blood from asthma and healthy participants. The Morse clustering algorithm defined nine clusters, BC1-9, representing molecular phenotypes with discrete phenotypes including Type-1, 2 &amp; 17 cytokine inflammatory pathways. The TDA network model and clusters were also characterised by activity of glucocorticoid receptor signalling associated with different expression profiles of glucocorticoid receptor (GR), according to microarray probesets targeted to the start or end of the GR mRNA\u2019s 3\u2019 UTR; suggesting differential GR mRNA processing as a possible driver of asthma phenotypes including steroid insensitivity.","Objective Evidence on the association between the gut microbiome and metabolic conditions has been increasing during the past decades. Unlike the straightforward identification of beneficial non-pathogenic bacteria as a potential probiotic for clinical use, the analysis of gut microbiome diversity is more complex and required a better understanding of various measures. We aim to summarize an elaborated list of gut microbiome diversity measures.","Background Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) and Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) lead to unemployment, poverty, increased mortality, and decreased quality of life in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). Telemedicine is increasingly facilitating access to healthcare, in LMICs. This prospective cohort intervention study aims to investigate feasibility and acceptability of telerehabilitation to provide long-term follow-up of individuals with SCI and ABI, in Nepal, post-discharge from hospital.","Background Numerous interventions for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been investigated by randomized controlled trials (RCTs). This systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) aim to provide a comprehensive evaluation of efficacy of available treatments for COVID-19.","Background The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is evolving differently in Africa compared to other regions, with lower transmission and milder clinical presentation. Reasons for this are not fully understood. Recent data from Eastern and Southern Africa suggest that transmission may be higher than measured. Detailed epidemiological data in different African settings is urgently needed.","In March of 2020, the World Health Organization declared a pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The pandemic led to a shortage of N95-grade filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs), especially for protection of healthcare professionals against airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We and others have previously reported promising decontamination methods that may be applied to the recycling and reuse of FFRs. In this study we tested disinfection of three viruses including SARS-CoV-2, dried on a piece of meltblown fabric, the principal component responsible for filtering of fine particles in N95-level FFRs, under a range of temperatures (60-95\u00b0C) at ambient or 100% relative humidity (RH) in conjunction with filtration efficiency testing. We found that heat treatments of 75\u00b0C for 30 min or 85\u00b0C for 20 min at 100% RH resulted in efficient decontamination from the fabric of SARS-CoV-2, human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), and another enveloped RNA virus, chikungunya virus vaccine strain 181 (CHIKV-181), without lowering the meltblown fabric\u2019s filtration efficiency.","Main risk factors of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) include both genetic and non-genetic factors, especially prenatal and perinatal events. Newborn screening dried blood spot (DBS) samples have great potential for the study of early biochemical markers of disease. To study DBS strengths and limitations in the context of ASD research, we analyzed the metabolomic profiles of newborns later diagnosed with ASD. We performed LC-MS/MS-based untargeted metabolomics on DBS from 37 case-control pairs randomly selected from the iPsych sample. After preprocessing using MZmine 2.41.2, metabolites were putatively annotated using mzCloud, GNPS feature-based molecular networking and MolNetEnhancer. 4360 mass spectral features were detected, of which 150 could be putatively annotated at a high confidence level. Chemical structure information at a broad level could be retrieved for 1009 metabolites, covering 31 chemical classes. Although no clear distinction between cases and controls was revealed, our method covered many metabolites previously associated with ASD, suggesting that biochemical markers of ASD are present at birth and may be monitored during newborn screening. Additionally, we observed that gestational age, age at sampling and month of birth influence the metabolomic profiles of newborn DBS, which informs us on the important confounders to address in future studies.","Tuberculosis (TB) patients present dysregulated immunity, iron metabolism and anaemia of inflammation. In this study, circulatory cytokines, trace metals, and iron-related proteins (hepcidin, ferroportin, transferrin, DMT1, Nramp1, ferritin, ceruloplasmin, hemojuvelin, aconitase, transferring receptor) were monitored in case (active tuberculosis patients: ATB) and control (non-tuberculosis: NTB and healthy) study populations (n=72, male, 42.94 mean age (16-83)). Using serum elemental and cytokine levels, a partial least square discriminate analysis model (PLS-DA) was built and variables with a VIP score of &gt;0.6 were selected as important markers. A biosignature of IL-13, IL-12(p70), IFN-\u03b3, IL-10, IL-5, IL-18, IL-4, Selenium, and Aluminium clustered ATB away from controls. Interestingly, low iron and selenium levels, while high copper and aluminum levels were observed in ATB subjects. All the important serum cytokines were positively correlated in ATB subjects. A low abundance of transferrin, ferroportin, and hemojuvelin, while higher ferritin and ceruloplasmin levels explained an altered iron metabolism in ATB subjects which partially resolved upon completion of treatment. Further, the identified biosignature in TB patients, that explained anemia of inflammation, along with perturbed iron homeostasis could be useful targets for the development of host-directed adjunct therapeutics.","Background VirtUaL ChIP-seq Analysis through Networks (VULCAN) infers regulatory interactions of transcription factors by overlaying networks generated from publicly available tumor expression data onto ChIP-seq data. We applied our method to dissect the regulation of Estrogen Receptor-alpha (ER) activation in breast cancer to identify potential coregulators of the ER\u2019s transcriptional response.","Introduction Seroprevalence studies can provide a measure of cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but a better understanding of antibody dynamics following infection is needed to assess longevity of detectability. Infection is characterised by detection of spike (anti-S) and nucleocapsid (anti-N) antibodies, whereas vaccination only stimulates anti-S. Consequently, in the context of a highly vaccinated population, presence of anti-N can be used as a marker of previous infection but waning over time may limit its use.","Blood biomarkers include disease intervention targets that may interact with genetic and environmental factors resulting in subgroups of individuals who respond differently to treatment. Such interactions may be observed in genetic effects on trait variance. Variance prioritisation is an approach to identify genetic loci with interaction effects by estimating their association with trait variance, even where the modifier is unknown or unmeasured. Here, we develop and evaluate a regression-based Brown-Forsythe test and variance effect estimate to detect such interactions. We provide scalable open-source software (varGWAS) for genome-wide association analysis of SNP-variance effects (https://github.com/MRCIEU/varGWAS) and apply our software to 30 blood biomarkers in UK Biobank. We find 468 variance quantitative trait loci across 24 biomarkers and follow up findings to detect 82 gene-environment and six gene-gene interactions independent of strong scale or phantom effects. Our results replicate existing findings and identify novel epistatic effects of TREH rs12225548 x FUT2 rs281379 and TREH rs12225548 x ABO rs635634 on alkaline phosphatase and ZNF827 rs4835265 x NEDD4L rs4503880 on gamma glutamyltransferase. These data could be used to discover possible subgroup effects for a given biomarker during preclinical drug development.","Bourbon virus (BRBV) was first discovered in 2014 in a fatal human case. Since then it has been detected in the Amblyomma americanum tick in the states of Missouri and Kansas in the United States. Despite the high prevalence of BRBV in ticks in these states, very few human cases have been reported, and the true infection burden of BRBV in the community is unknown. Here, we developed two virus neutralization assays, a VSV-BRBV pseudotyped rapid assay, and a BRBV focus reduction neutralization assay, to assess the seroprevalence of BRBV neutralizing antibodies in human sera collected in 2020 in St. Louis, Missouri. Out of 440 human serum samples tested, three (0.7%) were able to potently neutralize both VSV-BRBV and wild type BRBV. These findings suggest that human infections with BRBV are more common than previously recognized.","Cytokine storms and hyperinflammation, potentially controlled by glucocorticoids, occur in COVID-19; the roles of lipid mediators and acetylcholine (ACh) and how glucocorticoid therapy affects their release in Covid-19 remain unclear. Blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples from SARS-CoV-2- and non-SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects were collected for metabolomic/lipidomic, cytokines, soluble CD14 (sCD14), and ACh, and CD14 and CD36-expressing monocyte/macrophage subpopulation analyses. Transcriptome reanalysis of pulmonary biopsies was performed by assessing coexpression, differential expression, and biological networks. Correlations of lipid mediators, sCD14, and ACh with glucocorticoid treatment were evaluated. This study enrolled 190 participants with Covid-19 at different disease stages, 13 hospitalized non-Covid-19 patients, and 39 healthy-participants. SARS-CoV-2 infection increased blood levels of arachidonic acid (AA), 5-HETE, 11-HETE, sCD14, and ACh but decreased monocyte CD14 and CD36 expression. 5-HETE, 11-HETE, cytokines, ACh, and neutrophils were higher in BAL than in circulation (fold-change for 5-HETE 389.0; 11-HETE 13.6; ACh 18.7, neutrophil 177.5, respectively). Only AA was higher in circulation than in BAL samples (fold-change 7.7). Results were considered significant at P&lt;0.05, 95%CI. Transcriptome data revealed a unique gene expression profile associated with AA, 5-HETE, 11-HETE, ACh, and their receptors in Covid-19. Glucocorticoid treatment in severe/critical cases lowered ACh without impacting disease outcome. We first report that pulmonary inflammation and the worst outcomes in Covid-19 are associated with high levels of ACh and lipid mediators. Glucocorticoid therapy only reduced ACh, and we suggest that treatment may be started early, in combination with AA metabolism inhibitors, to better benefit severe/critical patients.","Aim To assess the role of occupation in the spread of COVID-19 among immigrants in Norway.","Objective Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease that may play a role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic vascular diseases. We conducted this systematic review to investigate the association between psoriasis and the risk of aortic aneurysm.","Defects in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) have been reported in COVID-19 patients, but the timing and organs affected vary among reports. Here, we reveal the dynamics of COVID-19 through transcription profiles in nasopharyngeal and autopsy samples from patients and infected rodent models. While mitochondrial bioenergetics is repressed in the viral nasopharyngeal portal of entry, it is up regulated in autopsy lung tissues from deceased patients. In most disease stages and organs, discrete OXPHOS functions are blocked by the virus, and this is countered by the host broadly up regulating unblocked OXPHOS functions. No such rebound is seen in autopsy heart, results in severe repression of genes across all OXPHOS modules. Hence, targeted enhancement of mitochondrial gene expression may mitigate the pathogenesis of COVID-19.","Data posted in the COVID 19 tracking website for RT-PCR (PCR) results and hospital admissions are used to estimate the time course of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the United States (1) and individual states. Hospital admissions mitigate positive sampling bias in PCR tests since these were limited in numbers initially. Additionally, their intent was as a diagnostic rather than a surveying tool.","Background Higher stress during pregnancy associates with negative outcomes and elevated inflammation. The gut microbiota reflects the environment, lifestyle, and the perinatal period. The gut microbiota, alongside host immune responses, has the potential to aid in identifying when stress is excessive.","Background Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) when used isolated or combined with static magnetic field (PBMT-sMF) has been proven benefits on skeletal muscle increasing performance and reducing fatigue, increasing oxygen saturation, and modulating inflammatory process. However, it is unknown whether the effects observed with this therapy on respiratory muscles will be similar to the effects previously observed on skeletal muscles.","The aim of this study was to provide support for the performance, localization and expression of the epithelial calcium transporter channels, calbindin-D28k (Calb) and TRPV6, and of the morphology of the digestive and reproductive system of laying quails under heat stress, and with methionine supplementation. Therefore, the present study characterized the positivity (immunohistochemistry) and expression (real-time PCR) of calcium channels (Calb and TRPV6) in the kidneys, intestine and uterus of 504 laying quails that were submitted to different methionine supplementation (100, 110 and 120%) and temperatures (20, 24, 28 and 32\u00b0C). The animals under thermal stress had lower villus height, villus:crypt ratio, and goblet cell index in the duodenum and jejunum, fewer secondary and tertiary uterine folds, smaller hepatic steatosis, and increased number of distal convoluted renal tubules (CT) positive to Calb (protein), and increased positivity in proximal CTs. The deleterious effects of heat stress were minimized with methionine supplementation for the following variables: duodenal crypts, number of goblet cells of the jejunum, number of uterine folds, decreased Calb positivity in intestines and kidney, increased positivity of Calb in the uterus and increased TRPV6 gene expression in the kidney. Calcium transporters were altered due to less need for calcium absorption and reabsorption due to more calcium available with the supplementation, increasing egg production and quality. Methionine supplementation further increased intestinal villus absorption area and height, increased steatosis, decreased Calb positivity in the intestine and kidney, increased uterine positivity and Calb expression, and increased TRPV6 expression in the uterus under thermoneutrality. This is the first study that describes the gene and protein expression of calcium transporters in the intestine, kidney and uterus of laying quails, and concludes that the use of methionine supplementation is justifiable in order to partially reverse the deleterious effects of thermal stress on the production.","Colorectal cancer (CRC) is characterised by heritable risk that is not well understood. Heritable, genetic variation at 11q23.1 is associated with increased colorectal cancer (CRC) risk, demonstrating eQTL effects on 3 cis- and 23 trans-eQTL targets. We sought to determine the relationship between 11q23.1 cis- and trans-eQTL target expression and test for potential cell-specificity. scRNAseq from 32,361 healthy colonic epithelial cells was aggregated and subject to weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). One module (blue) included 19 trans-eQTL targets and was correlated with C11orf53 expression only. Following unsupervised clustering of single cells, the expression of 19 trans-eQTL targets was greatest and most variable in cluster number 11, which transcriptionally resembled tuft cells. 14 trans-eQTL targets were found to demarcate this cluster, 11 of which were corroborated in a second dataset. Intra-cluster WGCNA and module preservation analysis then identified twelve 11q23.1 trans-eQTL targets to comprise a network that was specific to cluster 11. Finally, linear modelling and differential abundance testing showed 11q23.1 trans-eQTL target expression was predictive of cluster 11 abundance. Our findings suggest 11q23.1 trans-eQTL targets comprise a C11orf53-related network that is likely tuft cell-specific and reduced expression of these genes correlates with reduced tuft cell abundance in silico.","Pioglitazone, a PPAR\u03b3 agonist, is used to treat type 2 diabetes (T2D). PPAR\u03b3 is highly expressed in adipose tissue (AT), however the effects of pioglitazone to improve insulin sensitivity are also evident in other tissues. We hypothesized that pioglitazone modifies the cargo of circulating AT-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) to alter interorgan crosstalk. We tested this in a 3-month trial in which 24 subjects with T2D who were well-controlled with diet/exercise or metformin were randomized to treatment with either pioglitazone 45 mg/day or placebo (NCT00656864). Levels of 42 adipocyte-derived EV-miRNAs were measured in plasma EVs. Levels of 5 miRNAs (i.e., miR-7-5p, miR-20a-5p, miR-92a-3p, miR-195-5p, and miR-374b-5p) were significantly downregulated in EVs in response to pioglitazone treatment relative to placebo. However, the opposite occurred for miR-195-5p in subcutaneous AT from the same participants. Changes in miRNA expression in EVs and AT correlated with changes in suppression of lipolysis and improved insulin sensitivity, among others. DICER was downregulated and exosomal miRNA sorting-related genes YBX1 and hnRNPA2B1 displayed a trend toward downregulation in AT. Furthermore, analysis of EV-miRNA targeted genes identified a network of overtargeted transcripts that changed in a coordinated manner in AT. Collectively, our results suggest that some beneficial pharmacologic effects of PIO are mediated by adipose-specific miRNA regulation and exosomal/EV trafficking.","The diagnosis of mitochondrial disorders remains a challenging and often unmet need. We sought to investigate a sibling pair with suspected mitochondrial disease and a clinical presentation notable for global developmental delay, poor growth, sensorineural hearing loss, and brain MRI abnormalities, both with early death. Following uninformative exome and genome sequencing of the family quartet, RNA sequencing was pursued as an orthogonal testing strategy. RNA sequencing of fibroblasts from the older sibling identified the presence of a cryptic exon in intron 1 of NDUFB10, that included an in-frame stop codon. NDUFB10 encodes a subunit of mitochondrial OXPHOS complex I. Differential expression analysis relative to control samples suggested significantly decreased expression. The cryptic exon was found to contain a rare intronic variant, NM_004548.3:c.131-442G&gt;C, that was homozygous in both affected siblings and absent from population allele frequency databases. Immunoblot and quantitative proteomic analysis of fibroblasts from the older sibling revealed decreased abundance of complex I subunits associated with NDUFB10, providing evidence of isolated complex I deficiency. Biallelic variants in NDUFB10 have previously been reported in a single individual with infantile-onset mitochondrial disease. We present data implicating a deep intronic variant in NDUFB10 as the cause of mitochondrial disease in two further individuals. This variant results in loss of expression and overall destabilization of mitochondrial OXPHOS complex I and highlights the importance of RNA sequencing as a complementary diagnostic tool in patients undergoing genome-wide diagnostic evaluation.","Background Coping strategies and their efficacy vary greatly in patients suffering from fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS).","Parathyroid hormone (PTH) regulates calcium metabolism and bone strength. Chronic kidney disease leads to secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHP) which increases morbidity and mortality. In experimental SHP, the increased PTH gene expression is due to enhanced PTH mRNA stability, mediated by changes in its interaction with stabilizing AUF1 and destabilizing KSRP. Pin1 isomerizes target proteins and leads to KSRP dephosphorylation. In SHP, Pin1 isomerase activity is decreased and phosphorylated KSRP fails to bind PTH mRNA, resulting in high PTH mRNA stability and levels. However, the up- and down-stream mechanisms by which kidney failure stimulates the parathyroid remain elusive. We now reveal a pathway where kidney failure induces parathyroid Pin1 phosphorylation, linking Pin1, KSRP and PTH mRNA stability as key players for the high PTH expression in SHP. We identified by mass-spectrometry, changes in rat parathyroid proteome and phosphoproteome profiles induced by impaired renal function, including KSRP phosphorylation at Pin1 target sites. Furthermore, both acute and chronic kidney failure led to parathyroid-specific Pin1 Ser16 and Ser71 phosphorylation, which disrupts Pin1 activity. Accordingly, pharmacologic Pin1 inhibition, that mimics the decreased Pin1 activity in SHP, increased PTH expression ex-vivo in parathyroid organ cultures and in transfected cells, through the PTH mRNA protein-interacting element and KSRP phosphorylation at potential Pin1-binding motifs. Therefore, kidney failure leads to loss of parathyroid Pin1 activity by inducing Pin1 phosphorylation. This predisposes parathyroids to increase PTH production through impaired PTH mRNA decay that is dependent on KSRP phosphorylation. Pin1 and KSRP phosphorylation and the Pin1-KSRP-PTH mRNA axis thus drive SHP.","It has been recently shown that the adjunct use of corticosteroids in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia shorten the time taken to reach clinical stability (time to clinical stability) in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Considering the hyperglycemic effects of corticosteroids, there are concerns about the efficacy and safety of this therapy for children with CAP. Our objective is to evaluate the influence of recent advances in adjunct corticosteroid use and/or aerosolized antibiotic administration on admission to hospital with our main outcome being duration of fever and hospital stay, and additional outcomes as the time to clinical stability therapeutic efficacy, C-reactive protein and defervescence at 24, 48, and 72 hours after starting treatment in a well-defined cohort of children with community-acquired pneumonia. Therapeutic efficacy is defined as the rate of achieving clinical recovery with no fever, improvement or disappearance of cough, and improved or normal laboratory values. Five academic literature databases will be searched using Boolean keyword searches. Articles eligible for inclusion are those that present original research with the study topic as CAP, the study was designed as a randomized controlled trial (RCT) or clinical trial (CT) or an observational study with controls. The review will result in a narrative synthesis that summarizes the effectiveness of corticosteroid use in children.","Human epidermal Langerhans cells (LCs) can coordinate both immunogenic and tolerogenic immune responses, creating an attractive opportunity for immunomodulation strategies. To investigate transcriptional determinants of human primary LC tolerance we applied single cells RNA-sequencing combined with transcriptional network modelling and functional analysis. Unsupervised clustering of single cell transcriptomes revealed that steady-state LCs exist in immature and immunocompetent states, and become fully immunocompetent on migration. Interestingly, LC migration, which has been shown to result in upregulation of the transcription factor IRF4, led in parallel to increased expression of a tolerogenic gene module including IDO1, LGALS1, LAMTOR1 and IL10RA, which translated to efficient induction of regulatory T cells in co-culture assays by immunocompetent LCs. Using protein expression analysis and perturbation with inhibitors, we confirmed the role of IDO1 as a mediator of LC tolerogenic responses induced during LC migration. Computational analysis of regulons and Partial Information Decomposition analyses identified IRF4 as a key driver for LC tolerogenic programmes. The predicted IRF4-regulated genes were confirmed by analysis of CRISPR-Cas9 edited LCs. These findings suggest that efficient priming of tolerogenic responses by LCs requires upregulation of a migration-coupled maturation program which is superimposed with a tolerance-inducing genomic module.","Background The D-Health Trial aims to determine whether monthly high-dose vitamin D supplementation can reduce the mortality rate and prevent cancer. We did not have adequate statistical power for subgroup analyses, so could not justify the high cost of collecting blood samples at baseline. To enable future exploratory analyses stratified by baseline vitamin D status, we developed a model to predict baseline serum 25 hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration.","COVID-19 is a deadly pulmonary disease with unique clinical features. A thorough understanding of the molecular and histological correlates of the disease is still missing, especially because post-mortem analysis of COVID-19-affected organs has been so far scant and often anecdotical. Here we report the results of the systematic analysis of 41 consecutive post-mortem samples from individuals who died of COVID-19. We found that the disease is characterized by extensive alveolar damage and thrombosis of the lung micro- and macro-vasculature. Thrombi were in different stages of organization, consistent with an ongoing, endogenous thrombotic process. In all the analyzed samples, in situ RNA hybridization showed that pneumocytes and vascular endothelial cells had massive presence of viral RNA even at the later stages of the disease. An additional feature of the disease was the presence, in the vast majority of patients, of a large number of dysmorphic pneumocytes, often forming large syncytial elements, a consequence of the fusogenic activity of the viral Spike protein, detected with specific antibodies. Despite occasional presence of virus-positive cells in the heart, no overt signs of viral infection were detected in other organs, which showed common alterations compatible with prolonged hypoxia, multifocal organ disease or previous comorbidities. In summary, COVID-19 is a unique interstitial pneumonia with extensive lung thrombosis, long-term persistence of viral replication in pneumocytes and endothelial cells, along with the presence of infected cellular syncytia in the lung. We propose that several of the COVID-19 disease features are due to the persistence of virus-infected cells in the lungs of the infected individuals for the duration of the disease.","Solar UV-C photons do not reach Earth\u2019s surface, but are known to be endowed with germicidal properties that are also effective on viruses. The effect of softer UV-B and UV-A photons, which copiously reach the Earth\u2019s surface, on viruses are instead little studied, particularly on single-stranded RNA viruses.","Objectives To evaluate a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI) method for the detection of malignant skin lesions from dermoscopic images.","The study \u201cSex- and gender-sensitive prevention of cardiovascular and metabolic disease in older adults in Germany\u201d, the GendAge study, focusses on major risk factors for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases and on the development of major outcomes from intermediate phenotypes in the context of biological sex and gender differences. It is based on a re-investigation of participants of the Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II). The Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II) is aiming at identifying factors that distinguish healthy from unhealthy ageing and completed baseline assessments in 2,200 adult volunteers (1,600 participants aged 60\u201380 years and 600 participants aged 20\u201335 years) in 2014. The BASE-II follow-up assessments of 1,100 men and women aged 65\u201394 years in 2018\u20132020 were part of GendAge. In addition to re-assessing most baseline measures (geriatrics, internal medicine, immunology and psychology) we implemented a comprehensive gender questionnaire covering socio-cultural gender characteristics and added high-quality echocardiography.","To investigate cross-ancestry genetics of complex traits, we conducted a phenome-wide analysis of loci with heterogeneous effects across African, Admixed-American, Central/South Asian, East Asian, European, and Middle Eastern participants of UK Biobank (N=441,331). Testing 843 phenotypes, we identified 82 independent genomic regions mapping variants showing genome-wide significant (GWS) associations (p&lt;5\u00d710\u22128) in the trans-ancestry meta-analysis and GWS heterogeneity among the ancestry-specific effects. These included: i) loci with GWS association in one ancestry and concordant but heterogeneous effects among the other ancestries; ii) loci with a GWS association in one ancestry group and an experiment-wide significant discordant effect (p&lt;6.1\u00d710\u22124) in at least another ancestry. Since the trans-ancestry GWS associations were mostly driven by the European-ancestry sample size, we investigated the differences of allele frequency (\u0394AF) and linkage-disequilibrium regulome tagging (\u0394LD) between European populations and the other ancestries. Within loci with concordant effects, the degree of heterogeneity was associated with European \u2013 Middle Eastern \u0394AF (p=9.04\u00d710\u22126) and \u0394LD of European populations with respect to African, Admixed-American, and Central/South Asian groups (p=8.21\u00d710\u22124, p=7.17\u00d710\u22124, and p=2.16\u00d710\u22123, respectively). Within loci with discordant effects, \u0394AF and \u0394LD of European populations with respect to African and Central/South Asian ancestries was associated with the degree of heterogeneity (\u0394AF: p=7.69\u00d710\u22123 and p=5.31\u00d710\u22123, \u0394LD: p=0.016 and p=2.65\u00d710\u22124, respectively). Considering the traits associated with cross-ancestry heterogeneous loci, we observed enrichments for blood biomarkers (p=5.7\u00d710\u221235) and physical appearance (p=1.38\u00d710\u22124). This suggests that these specific phenotypic domains may present considerable cross-ancestry heterogeneity due to large allele frequency and LD variation among worldwide populations.","There is a need to develop identification tests for Metabolism Disrupting Chemicals (MDCs) with diabetogenic activity. Here we used the human EndoC-\u03b2H1 \u03b2-cell line, the rat \u03b2-cell line INS-1E and dispersed mouse islet cells to assess the effects of endocrine disruptors on cell viability and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). We tested six chemicals at concentrations within human exposure (from 0.1 pM to 1 \u03bcM). Bisphenol-A (BPA) and tributyltin (TBT) were used as controls while four other chemicals, namely perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), triphenylphosphate (TPP), triclosan (TCS) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), were used as \u201cunknowns\u201d. Regarding cell viability, BPA and TBT increased cell death as previously observed. Their mode of action involved the activation of estrogen receptors and PPAR\u03b3, respectively. ROS production was a consistent key event in BPA- and TBT-treated cells. None of the other MDCs tested modified viability or ROS production. Concerning GSIS, TBT increased insulin secretion while BPA produced no effects. PFOA decreased GSIS, suggesting that this chemical could be a \u201cnew\u201d diabetogenic agent. Our results indicate that the EndoC-\u03b2H1 cell line is a suitable human \u03b2-cell model for testing diabetogenic MDCs. Optimization of the test methods proposed here could be incorporated into tier protocols for the identification of MDCs.","Accumulating research suggests the structure of psychopathology is best represented by continuous higher-order dimensions, including a general dimension, p-factor, and more specific dimensions, e.g., residualized externalizing and internalizing factors. Here, we aimed to 1) replicate p in early childhood; 2) externally validate the factors with key constructs of psychological functioning; 3) examine stability and change of genetic and environmental influences on the psychopathology factors from early-to mid-childhood; 4) examine the factors\u2019 predictive utility; and 5) test whether the factors can be predicted by early life measures (e.g., neonatal complications). The Longitudinal Israeli Study of Twins from age 3 to 9 was used for the analyses. Mothers reported on developmental problems, pregnancy and neonatal conditions, and filled in questionnaires on each twin\u2019s externalizing and internalizing symptoms. Cognitive ability was assessed in the lab at age 6.5 and personality traits, self-esteem, and life satisfaction were self-reported by the twins at ages 11-13. A bifactor model that included p and externalizing and internalizing factors fit the data best and associations between p, cognitive ability, and personality were replicated. Longitudinal twin analyses indicated that p is highly heritable (64-73%) with a substantial proportion of the genetic influences stable from age 3. The residualized internalizing and externalizing factors were also highly heritable. Higher p predicted developmental problems at age 8-9 and lower self-esteem at age 11. Early life measures were not strongly associated with psychopathology. Our results show that p is discernible in early childhood, highly heritable, and prospectively associated with negative outcomes.","The role of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure in the pathology of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) has been debated for decades with epidemiological evidence failing to find a clear consensus for or against it playing a role. A key reason for this is a lack of foundational research into the response of living retinal tissue to UVR in regard to AMD-specific parameters of tissue function. We therefore explored the response of cultured retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE), the loss of which heralds advanced AMD, to specific wavelengths of UVR across the UV-B and UV-A bands found in natural sunlight.","The steroid hormone, Glucocorticoid (GC) is a well-known immunosuppressant that controls T cell-mediated adaptive immune response. In this work, we have developed a minimal kinetic network model of T-cell regulation connecting relevant experimental and clinical studies to quantitatively understand the long-term effects of GC on pro-inflammatory T-cell (Tpro) and anti-inflammatory T-cell (Tanti) dynamics. Due to the antagonistic relation between these two types of T-cells, their long-term steady-state population ratio helps us to characterize three classified immune-regulations: (i) weak ([Tpro]&gt;[Tanti]); (ii) strong ([Tpro]&lt;[Tanti]), and (iii) moderate ([Tpro] \u223c [Tanti]); holding the characteristic bistability). In addition to the differences in their long-term steady-state outcome, each immune-regulation shows distinct dynamical phases. In the pre-steady, a characteristic intermediate stationary phase is observed to develop only in the moderate regulation regime. In the medicinal field, the resting time in this stationary phase is distinguished as a clinical latent period. GC dose-dependent steady-state analysis shows an optimal level of GC to drive a phase-transition from the weak/auto-immune prone to the moderate regulation regime. Subsequently, the pre-steady state clinical latent period tends to diverge near that optimal GC level where [Tpro]: [Tanti] is highly balanced. The GC-optimized elongated stationary phase explains the rationale behind the requirement of long-term immune diagnostics, especially when long-term GC-based chemotherapeutics and other immunosuppressive drugs are administrated. Moreover, our study reveals GC sensitivity of clinical latent period which might serve as an early warning signal in the diagnosis of different immune phases and determining immune phase-wise steroid treatment.","The innate and adaptive immune response are regulated by biological clocks, and circulating lymphocytes are lowest at sunrise. Accordingly, severity of disease in mouse models is highly dependent on the time of day of viral infection. Here, we explore whether circadian immunity contributes significantly to seasonality of respiratory viruses, including influenza and SARS-CoV-2. Susceptibility-Infection-Recovery-Susceptibility (SIRS) models of influenza and SIRS-derived models of COVID-19 suggest that local sunrise time is a better predictor of the basic reproductive number (R0) than climate, even when day length is taken into account. Moreover, these models predict a window of susceptibility when local sunrise time corresponds to the morning commute and contact rate is expected to be high. Counterfactual modeling suggests that retaining daylight savings time in the fall would reduce the length of this window, and substantially reduce seasonal waves of respiratory infections.","Phenotypes extracted from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are increasingly prevalent in genetic studies. EHRs contain hundreds of distinct clinical laboratory test results, providing a trove of health data beyond diagnoses. Such lab data is complex and lacks a ubiquitous coding scheme, making it more challenging than diagnosis data. Here we describe the first large-scale cross-health system genome-wide association study (GWAS) of EHR-based quantitative lab measurements. We meta-analyzed 70 labs matched between the BioVU cohort from the Vanderbilt University Health System and the Michigan Genomics Initiative (MGI) cohort from Michigan Medicine. We show high replication of known association for these labs, validating EHR-based measurements as high-quality phenotypes for genetic analysis. Notably, our analysis provides the first replication for 700 previous GWAS associations across 46 different labs. We discovered 31 novel associations at genome-wide significance for 22 distinct labs, including the first reported associations for two labs. We replicated 22 of these novel associations in an independent tranche of BioVU samples. The summary statistics for all association tests are available through an interactive webtool to benefit other researchers. Finally, we performed mirrored analyses in BioVU and MGI to assess competing analytic practices for lab data. We find that using the mean of all available lab measurements provides a robust summary value, but alternate summarizations can improve power in certain labs. This study provides a proof-of-principle for cross health system GWAS and is a framework for future studies of quantitative traits in EHRs.","Purpose Determining the triggering factor of the sudden surge of the daily new COVID-19 cases arising in most European countries during 2020 Autumn.","Introduction Hansen\u2019s disease, or leprosy, is a major public health problem in developing countries, caused by Mycobacterium leprae, and affecting the skin and peripheral nerves. However, M. leprae can also affect bone tissue, mucous membranes, liver, eyes, and testicles, producing a variety of clinical phenotypes. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been expressed in the various clinical forms of leprosy and could potentially be used for its diagnosis.","Dendritic cells (DCs) play an important role in anti-tumor immunity by inducing T cell differentiation. Herein, we found that the mechanical sensor Piezo1 expressed by DCs integrates innate inflammatory stimuli and stiffness signals and directs the reciprocal differentiation of TH1 and regulatory T (Treg) cells in cancer. Genetic deletion of Piezo1 in DCs inhibited the generation of TH1 cells while driving the development of Treg cells in promoting cancer growth. Mechanistically, Piezo1-deficient DCs regulated the secretion of the polarizing cytokines TGF\u03b21 and IL-12, leading to increased TGF\u03b2R2-p-Smad3 activity and decreased IL-12R\u03b22-p-STAT4 activity while inducing the reciprocal differentiation of Treg and TH1 cells. In addition, Piezo1 integrated the SIRT1-hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF1\u03b1)-dependent metabolic pathway and calcium-calcineurin-NFAT signaling pathway to orchestrate reciprocal TH1 and Treg lineage commitment through DC-derived IL-12 and TGF\u03b21. Our studies provide critical insight for understanding the role of the DC-based mechanical regulation of immunopathology in directing T cell lineage commitment in tumor microenvironments.","The statistical relationships of total COVID-19 Cases and Deaths per million populations in 45 countries, where 85.8% of the world\u2019s population lives with 10 demographic, economic and social indicators were studied. Data for 28 May 2020 were used in the main calculations. The relationship of Deaths per million population and total Cases per million population is very close and reaches correlation coefficient R = 0.926. It is interesting that the close correlations were found of Cases and Deaths per 1 million with a purely economic index like GDP PPP per capita, where R = 0.687 and R = 0.660, respectively. Even more close correlations were found of Cases and Deaths per 1 million with a composite index HDI, where the correlation coefficients reach 0.724 and 0.680, respectively. The main reason for these paradoxical results is the underestimation of pandemic restrictions in the form of masks, social distance and disinfection in most of these countries. Other indicators (excluding Gini index and Population Density) also show statistically significant correlations with Cases and Deaths per 1 million with correlation coefficients from 0.432 to 0.634. The statistical significance of the found correlations determined using Student\u2019s t-test was p &lt;0.0001. Surprisingly, there was no statistically significant correlation between Cases and Deaths with Population Density. To check whether there is a change in the correlations with the development of the pandemic, a statistical analysis was made for four different dates \u2013 9 April, 28 May, 7 August and 30 November 2020. It was found that the correlation coefficients of COVID-19 cases and Deaths with the rest indicators decrease during the pandemic.","Yetmezlik kiriklarinda klinik ve radyografik bulgular her zaman belirgin olmayabilir ya da doktoru yanlis yonlendirebilir. Biz burada hareketle artan bel agrisi ve sabah tutuklugu nedeni ile basvuran ve ilk etapta spondiloartropati lehine degerlendirilen bir hastayi sunuyoruz. Yapilan manyetik rezonans goruntuleme (MRG) ile sakrum ve bilateral iliak kanatta yetmezlik kiriklari saptanan hastada sonucta laboratuvar ve goruntuleme bulgulari isiginda hiperparatiroidizme neden olan bir paratiroid adenomu tesbit edildi ve cerrahi olarak cikarildi.","The rollout of COVID-19 vaccines has begun to at-risk populations around the world. It is currently unclear whether rejection of the vaccine will pose challenges for achieving herd/community immunity either through large-scale rejection or localised pockets. Here we predict uptake of the vaccine at unprecedented spatial resolution across the UK using a large-scale survey of over 17,000 individuals. Although the majority of the UK population would likely take the vaccine, there is substantial heterogeneity in uptake intent across the UK. Large urban areas, including London and North West England, females, Black or Black British ethnicities, and Polish-speakers are among the least accepting. This study helps identify areas and socio-demographic groups where vaccination levels may not reach those levels required for herd immunity. Identifying clusters of non-vaccinators is extremely important in the context of achieving herd immunity as vaccination \u201ccold-spots\u201d can amplify epidemic spread and disproportionately increase vaccination levels required for herd protection.","The translational potential of MR-based connectivity modelling is limited by the need for advanced diffusion imaging, which is not part of clinical protocols for many diseases. In addition, where diffusion data is available, brain connectivity analyses rely on tractography algorithms which imply two major limitations. First, tracking algorithms are known to be sensitive to the presence of white matter lesions and therefore leading to interpretation pitfalls and poor inter-subject comparability in clinical applications such as multiple sclerosis. Second, tractography quality is highly dependent on the acquisition parameters of diffusion sequences, leading to a trade-off between acquisition time and tractography precision.","Chronic wounds impose a significant healthcare burden to a broad patient population. Cell based therapies, while having shown benefits for the treatment of chronic wounds, have not achieved widespread adoption into clinical practice. Here, we developed a novel CRISPR/Cas9 approach to precisely edit dendritic cells (DCs) to enhance their therapeutic potential for healing chronic wounds. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of tolerogenic DCs, we discover N-myc downregulated gene 2 (Ndrg2), which marks a specific population of DC progenitors, as a promising target for CRISPR knockout (KO). Ndrg2-KO alters the transcriptomic profile of DCs and preserves an immature cell state with a strong, pro-angiogenic and regenerative capacity. We then incorporated our CRISPR-based cell engineering within a hydrogel technology for in vivo cell delivery and developed a highly effective translational approach for DC based immunotherapy that accelerated healing of full-thickness wounds in both non-diabetic and diabetic mouse models. These findings could open the door to future clinical trials using safe gene editing in DCs for treating various types of chronic wounds.","BACKGROUND The efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma (CCP) for preventing infection in exposed, uninfected individuals is unknown. We hypothesized that CCP might prevent infection when administered before symptoms or laboratory evidence of infection.","Background Parathyroid Ca2+-sensing receptor (CaSR) activation inhibits parathyroid hormone (PTH) release, while activation of CaSRs in kidneys and intestine attenuates local transepithelial Ca2+ transport. In patients with autosomal dominant hypocalcemia 1 (ADH1) due to activating CASR mutations, treatment of symptomatic hypocalcemia can be complicated by treatment-induced hypercalciuria, resulting in nephrocalcinosis and renal insufficiency. Although CaSRs throughout the body are activated by increased extracellular Ca2+ concentrations, it is not understood why some ADH1 patients have reduced PTH, but not hypercalciuria at presentation, despite CaSR expression in both kidney and parathyroid.","Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is an arterivirus which causes significant economic losses to the swine industry worldwide. Here, we use ribosome profiling (RiboSeq) and parallel RNA sequencing (RNASeq) to characterise the transcriptome and translatome of both species of PRRSV and analyse the host response to infection. We quantified viral gene expression over a timecourse of infection, and calculated the efficiency of programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) at both sites on the viral genome. At the nsp2 frameshift site (a rare example of protein-stimulated frameshifting), \u22122 PRF efficiency increases over time, likely facilitated by accumulation of the PRF- stimulatory viral protein (nsp1\u03b2) during infection. This marks arteriviruses as the second example of temporally regulated PRF. Surprisingly, we also found PRF efficiency at the canonical ORF1ab frameshift site increases over time, in apparent contradiction of the common assumption that RNA structure-directed frameshift sites operate at a fixed efficiency. This has potential implications for the numerous other viruses with canonical PRF sites. Furthermore, we discovered several highly translated additional viral ORFs, the translation of which may be facilitated by multiple novel viral transcripts. For example, we found a 125-codon ORF overlapping nsp12, which is expressed as highly as nsp12 itself at late stages of replication, and is likely translated from novel subgenomic (sg) RNA transcripts that overlap the 3\u2032 end of ORF1b. Similar transcripts were discovered for both PRRSV-1 and PRRSV- 2, suggesting a potential conserved mechanism for temporal regulation of expression of the 3\u2032-proximal region of ORF1b. In addition, we identified a highly translated, short upstream ORF (uORF) in the 5\u2032 UTR, the presence of which is highly conserved amongst PRRSV-2 isolates. This is the first application of RiboSeq to arterivirus-infected cells, and reveals new features which add to the complexity of gene expression programmes in this important family of nidoviruses.","Background Many foods have an antioxidant activity, and nutrition may mitigate COVID-19. To test the potential role of vegetables in COVID-19 mortality in Europe, we performed an ecological study.","Trinucleotide repeat (TNR) expansions in the genome cause a number of degenerative diseases. A prominent TNR expansion involves the triplet CAG in the huntingtin (HTT) gene responsible for Huntington\u2019s disease (HD). Pathology is caused by protein and RNA generated from the TNR regions including small siRNA-sized repeat fragments. An inverse correlation between the length of the repeats in HTT and cancer incidence has been reported for HD patients. We now show that siRNAs based on the CAG TNR are toxic to cancer cells by targeting genes that contain long reverse complimentary TNRs in their open reading frames. Of the 60 siRNAs based on the different TNRs, the 6 members in the CAG/CUG family of related TNRs are the most toxic to both human and mouse cancer cells. siCAG/CUG TNR-based siRNAs induce cell death in vitro in all tested cancer cell lines and slow down tumor growth in a preclinical mouse model of ovarian cancer with no signs of toxicity to the mice. We propose to explore TNR-based siRNAs as a novel form of anti-cancer reagents.","Sequencing of whole cancer genomes has revealed an abundance of recurrent mutations in gene-regulatory promoter regions, in particular in melanoma where strong mutation hotspots are observed adjacent to ETS-family transcription factor (TF) binding sites. While sometimes interpreted as functional driver events, these mutations have also been suggested to be due to locally inhibited DNA repair or, alternatively, locally increased propensity for UV damage. Here, we provide evidence that base-specific elevations in the efficacy of UV lesion formation underlie these mutations. First, we find that low-dose UV light induces mutations preferably at a known ETS promoter hotspot in cultured cells even in the absence of global or transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (NER), ruling out inhibited repair. Further, by genome-wide mapping of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) shortly after UV exposure and thus before DNA repair, we find that ETS-related mutation hotspots exhibit a strong base-specific increase in CPD formation frequency. Analysis of a large whole genome cohort illustrates the widespread contribution of this effect to recurrent mutations in melanoma. While inhibited NER underlies a general increase in somatic mutation burden in regulatory regions, we conclude that the most recurrently mutated individual DNA bases arise instead due to locally favorable conditions for UV damage formation, thus explaining a key phenomenon in whole-genome cancer analyses.","HIV infection affects up to 30% of children presenting with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in Africa and is associated with increased mortality. Children with SAM are treated similarly regardless of HIV status, although mechanisms of nutritional recovery in HIV and/or SAM are not well understood. We performed a secondary analysis of a clinical trial and plasma proteomics data among children with complicated SAM in Kenya and Malawi. Compared to children with SAM without HIV (n = 113), HIV-infected children (n = 54) had evidence (false discovery rate (FDR) corrected p&lt;0.05) of metabolic stress, including enriched pathways related to inflammation and lipid metabolism. Moreover, we observed reduced plasma levels of zinc-\u03b1-2-glycoprotein, butyrylcholinesterase, and increased levels of complement C2 resembling findings in metabolic syndrome, diabetes and other non-communicable diseases. HIV was also associated (FDR corrected p&lt;0.05) with higher plasma levels of inflammatory chemokines. Considering evidence of biomarkers of metabolic stress, it is of potential concern that our current treatment strategy for SAM regardless of HIV status involves a high-fat therapeutic diet. The results of this study suggest a need for clinical trials of therapeutic foods that meet the specific metabolic needs of children with HIV and SAM.","Background The Melanoma Genomics Managing Your Risk Study is a randomised controlled trial that aims to evaluate the efficacy of providing information on personal genomic risk of melanoma in reducing ultraviolet radiation (UV) exposure, stratified by traditional risk group (low or high phenotypic risk) in the general population. The primary outcome is objectively measured total daily Standard Erythemal Doses at 12 months. Secondary outcomes include UV exposure at specific time periods, self-reported sun protection and skin-examination behaviors, psychosocial outcomes, and ethical considerations surrounding offering genomic testing at a population level. A within-trial and modelled economic evaluation will be undertaken from an Australian health system perspective to assess the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.","Background: Epigenetic age, a robust marker of biological aging, has been associated with obesity, low-grade inflammation and metabolic diseases. However, few studies have examined associations between different epigenetic age measures and risk of lung cancer, despite great interest in finding biomarkers to assist in risk stratification for lung cancer screening. \nMethods: A nested case-control study of lung cancer from the CLUE II cohort study was conducted using incidence density sampling with 1:1 matching of controls to lung cancer cases (n=208 matched pairs). Prediagnostic blood samples were collected in 1989 (CLUE II study baseline) and stored at -70 degrees Celsius. DNA was extracted from buffy coat and DNA methylation levels were measured using Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip Arrays. Three epigenetic age acceleration (i.e., biological age is greater than chronological age) measurements (Horvath, Hannum and PhenoAge) were examined in relation to lung cancer risk using conditional logistic regression.\nResults: We did not observe associations between the three epigenetic age acceleration measurements and risk of lung cancer overall; however, inverse associations for the two Hannum age acceleration measures (intrinsic and extrinsic) were observed in men and among younger participants, but not in women or older participants. We did not observe effect modification by time from blood draw to diagnosis.  \nConclusion: Findings from this study do not support a positive association between three different biological age acceleration measures and risk of lung cancer. Additional studies are needed to address whether epigenetic age is associated with lung cancer in never smokers.","Infection with the human-tropic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a strong risk factor for multiple sclerosis (MS), though the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To investigate EBV infection directly, we induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in immunocompromised mice humanized with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from individuals with or without a history of EBV infection and/or diagnosis of relapsing MS. HuPBMC EAE mice generated from EBV seronegative healthy donors (HD) were less susceptible to developing severe clinical symptoms than EBV seropositive cohorts. Donor EBV seropositivity and RRMS diagnosis led to a significant incremental increase in the human Th1:Treg CD4+ T cell ratio in the brain and spinal cord, as well as increased human cytotoxic CD8+ T cell and murine macrophage infiltration and demyelination. The data indicate that a history of EBV infection, further compounded by a diagnosis of RRMS, promotes Th1-mediated disease in a novel humanized mouse model of MS.","The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is rising worldwide and 10-15% of the global population currently suffers from CKD and its complications. Given the increasing prevalence of CKD there is an urgent need to find novel treatment options. The American black bear (Ursus americanus) copes with months of lowered kidney function and metabolism during hibernation without the devastating effects on metabolism and other consequences observed in humans. In a biomimetic approach to better understand kidney adaptations and physiology in hibernating black bears, we established a high-quality genome assembly. Subsequent RNA-Seq analysis of kidneys comparing gene expression profiles in black bears entering (late fall) and emerging (early spring) from hibernation identified 169 protein-coding genes that were differentially expressed. Of these, 101 genes were downregulated and 68 genes were upregulated after hibernation. Fold changes ranged from 1.8-fold downregulation (RTN4RL2) to 2.4-fold upregulation (CISH). Most notable was the upregulation of cytokine suppression genes (SOCS2, CISH, and SERPINC1) and the lack of increased expression of cytokines and genes involved in inflammation. The identification of these differences in gene expression in the black bear kidney may provide new insights in the prevention and treatment of CKD.","Background Since December 2019, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has massively spread, with overwhelming of health care systems and numerous deaths worldwide. To remedy this, several countries, including France, have taken strict lockdown measures, requiring the closure of all but essential places. This unprecedented disruption of daily routines has a strong potential for disrupting nutritional behaviours. Nutrition being one of the main modifiable risk factors for chronic disease risk, this may have further consequences for public health. Our objective was therefore to describe nutritional behaviours during the lockdown period and to put them in light of individual characteristics.","Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with a wide range of divergent pathologies, and risk of severe disease is reported to be increased by a similarly broad range of co-morbidities. The present study investigated blood metabolites in order to elucidate how infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 can lead to such a variety of pathologies and what common ground they share. COVID-19 patient blood samples were taken at hospital admission in two Belgian patient cohorts, and a third cohort that included longitudinal samples was used for additional validation (total n=581). A total of 251 blood metabolite measures and ratios were assessed using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and tested for association to disease severity. In line with the varied effects of severe COVID-19, the range of severity-associated biomarkers was equally broad and included increased inflammatory markers (glycoprotein acetylation), amino acid concentrations (increased leucine and phenylalanine), increased lipoprotein particle concentrations (except those of very low density lipoprotein, VLDL), decreased cholesterol levels (except in large HDL and VLDL), increased triglyceride levels (only in IDL and LDL), fatty acid levels (decreased poly-unsaturated fatty acid, increased mono-unsaturated fatty acid) and decreased choline concentration, with association sizes comparable to those of routine clinical chemistry metrics of acute inflammation. Our results point to systemic metabolic biomarkers for COVID-19 severity that make strong targets for further fundamental research into its pathology (e.g. phenylalanine and omega-6 fatty acids).","The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that was most recently discovered, quickly evolved into a global pandemic. Studies suggested that obesity was a major risk factor for its hospitalization and severity of symptoms. This study investigated the associations between obesity prevalence with overall COVID-19 cases and related deaths across states in the United States. General regression and Chi-square tests were used to examine those associations. The analyses indicated that obesity prevalence (%) across states were negatively associated with COVID-19 cases (p = 0.0448) and related deaths (p = 0.0181), with a decrease of 158 cases/100K population and 13 deaths/100K for every 5% increase of the obesity prevalence. When the states were divided based on the median of obesity prevalence (30.9%) into a group of states with low obesity prevalence and a group with high obesity prevalence, both the cases (671 vs 416 cases/100k population) and deaths (39 vs 21 deaths/100k population) were significantly different (p &lt; 0.001) across groups. These findings provided important information for the relationship between the dual pandemic threats of obesity and COVID-19. These results should not currently be considered as an indication that obesity is a protective factor for COVID-19, and would rather be used as a warning of the public advice that obese people is more vulnerable to COVID-19 infection, which may lead to a false safety message probably given to people with normal body weight.","Background The parasitic trematode Fasciola hepatica evades host immune defenses through secretion of various immunomodulatory molecules. Fatty Acid Binding Proteins (fhFABPs) are among the main excreted/secreted proteins and have been shown to display anti-inflammatory properties. However, little is currently known regarding their impact on dendritic cells (DCs) and their subsequent capacity to prime specific CD4+ T cell subsets.","The aim of the present study was study changes in antidepressant-like responses to Vitamin D3 (VD3) supplementation in three different doses (1.0, 2.5, and 5.0 mg/kg, s.c.) in long-term ovariectomized (OVX) rats treated with low dose of 17\u03b2-E2 (0.5 \u03bcg/rat, s.c.) during chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). Sucrose preference (SPT), forced swimming (FST), and open-field (OFT) tests were administered to measure depression-like behavior. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and serotonine (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) levels in the hippocampus were measured by ELISA, western blotting analysis, and by using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), respectively.","Clinical activity of 3740 de-identified COVID-19 positive patients treated at NYU Langone Health (NYULH) were collected between January and August 2020. XGBoost model trained on clinical data from the final 24 hours excelled at predicting mortality (AUC=0.92, specificity=86% and sensitivity=85%). Respiration rate was the most important feature, followed by SpO2 and age 75+. Performance of this model to predict the deceased outcome extended 5 days prior with AUC=0.81, specificity=70%, sensitivity=75%. When only using clinical data from the first 24 hours, AUCs of 0.79, 0.80, and 0.77 were obtained for deceased, ventilated, or ICU admitted, respectively. Although respiration rate and SpO2 levels offered the highest feature importance, other canonical markers including diabetic history, age and temperature offered minimal gain. When lab values were incorporated, prediction of mortality benefited the most from blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Features predictive of morbidity included LDH, calcium, glucose, and C-reactive protein (CRP). Together this work summarizes efforts to systematically examine the importance of a wide range of features across different endpoint outcomes and at different hospitalization time points.","Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) mortality in hospitalized patients is strongly associated with old age, nursing home residence, male sex and obesity, with a more controversial association with ethnicity and chronic diseases, in particular diabetes mellitus. Further complicating the evaluation of the independent impacts of these risk factors is the failure to control for frailty in published studies thus far.","Although hyaline cartilage is widely distributed in various invertebrate groups such as sabellid polychaetes, molluscs (cephalopods, gastropods) and a chelicerate arthropod group (horseshoe crabs), the enigmatic relationship and distribution of cartilage in taxonomic groups remains to be explained. It can be interpreted as a convergent trait in animal evolution and thus does not seem to be a vertebrate invention. Due to the poor fossil record of cartilaginous structures, occurrences of mineralized fossil cartilages are important for evolutionary biology and paleontology. Although the biochemical composition of recent cephalopod cartilage differs from vertebrate cartilage, histologically the cartilages of these animal groups resemble one another remarkably. In this study we present fossil material from the late Triassic Polzberg Konservat-Lagerst\u00e4tte near Lunz am See (Lower Austria, Northern Calcareous Alps). A rich Carnian fauna is preserved here, whereby a morphogroup (often associated with coleoid remains) of black, amorphous appearing fossils still remained undetermined. These multi-elemental, mirroring fossils show remarkable similarities to recent cephalopod cartilage. We examined the conspicuous micro- and ultrastructure of these enigmatic fossils by thin-sectioning and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The geochemical composition analyzed by Microprobe and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) revealed carbonisation as the taphonomic pathway for this fossil group. 3D preservation of this otherwise degradable soft tissue can be explained by the mineralization processes that may take place in particular environments. Fifty-nine specimens from the Polzberg locality and five specimens from Cave del Predil (formerly Raibl, Julian Alps, Italy) underwent extensive studies. The detected grooves are interpreted to be muscular attachment areas, and the preserved branched system of canaliculi is comparable to a channel system that is also present in recent coleoid cartilage. The new findings on these long-known enigmatic structures strongly point to the preservation of cranial cartilage belonging to the belemnoid Phragmoteuthis bisinuata.","Background Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) are the main side effects of statins. Currently, there are no effective biomarkers for accurate clinical diagnosis. Urine is not subject to homeostatic control and therefore accumulates early changes, making it an ideal biomarker source. We therefore examined urine proteome changes associated with SAMS in an animal model.","In the last decade, genome-scale metabolic models have been increasingly used to study plant metabolic behavior at the tissue and multi-tissue level under different environmental conditions. Quercus suber, also known as the cork oak tree, is one of the most important forest communities of the Mediterranean/Iberian region. In this work, we present the genome-scale metabolic model of the Q. suber (iEC7871), the first of a woody plant. The metabolic model comprises 7871 genes, 6231 reactions, and 6481 metabolites across eight compartments. Transcriptomics data was integrated into the model to obtain tissue-specific models for the leaf, inner bark, and phellogen, with specific biomass compositions. The tissue-specific models were merged into a diel multi-tissue metabolic model to predict interactions among the three tissues at the light and dark phases. The metabolic models were also used to analyze the pathways associated with the synthesis of suberin monomers. Nevertheless, the models developed in this work can provide insights into other aspects of the metabolism of Q. suber, such as its secondary metabolism and cork formation.","Previous therapeutic attempts to deplete cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) or inhibit their proliferation in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) were not successful in mice or patients. Thus, CAFs may be tumor suppressive or heterogeneous, with distinct cancer-restraining and -promoting CAFs (rCAFs and pCAFs, respectively). Here, we show that induced expression of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein Meflin, a rCAF-specific marker, in CAFs by genetic and pharmacological approaches improved the chemosensitivity of mouse PDAC. A chemical library screen identified Am80, a synthetic, non-natural retinoid, as a reagent that effectively induced Meflin expression in CAFs. Am80 administration improved the sensitivity of PDAC to chemotherapeutics, accompanied by increases in tumor vessel area and intratumoral drug delivery. Mechanistically, Meflin was involved in the suppression of tissue stiffening by interacting with lysyl oxidase to inhibit its collagen crosslinking activity. These data suggested that modulation of CAF heterogeneity may represent a strategy for PDAC treatment.","Monocyte to macrophage differentiation is an extremely essential cellular and immunological process aimed to combat the assault of foreign pathogens as well as this process has immense importance in the maintenance of physiological homeostasis. Differentiated macrophage, serving as specialized phagocytes is an indispensable component of innate immunity. Besides this, being a well-documented antigen-presenting cell (APC) macrophages also function as a key regulator of both humoral and cell-mediated immunity: the two integral components of adaptive immunity. Bacterial hopanoids are a primitive analogous of eukaryotic sterols that are established as a prominent immunomodulator. In this study, we have demonstrated the isolation protocol of neutral lipid fractions from different Gram-negative bacteria, and adopting several analytical approaches we proposed that the extracted lipid fractions may contain hopanoid as an active component. We have delved deeper into the biological effect of these probable hopanoids like compounds. Here, by considering the several structural and functional attributes like altered phenotype, expression of macrophage-specific markers, increased intracellular organelles, acquirement of enhanced phagocytic and inflammatory property, induction of autophagy, etc we have established hopanoids as a potential inducer of monocyte to macrophage differentiation. Thus, our study has unraveled a new immunomodulator present in Gram-negative bacteria and would undoubtedly help to understand the intricacies of host-pathogen interaction in a better and conclusive manner.","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated, neuroinflammatory disease of the central nervous system and in industrialised countries is the most common cause of progressive neurological disability in working age persons. However, there is significant inter-individual heterogeneity in disease activity and response to treatment. Currently, the ability to predict at diagnosis who will have a benign, intermediate, or aggressive disease course is very limited. There is therefore a need for integrated predictive tools to inform individualised treatment decision-making. FutureMS is a nationally representative, prospective observation cohort study comprising of 440 participants with a new diagnosis of relapsing remitting MS living in Scotland between May 2016 and March 2019. Established with the aim of addressing this need for individualised predictive tools, the cohort is designed to combine detailed clinical phenotyping with imaging, genetic and biomarker metrics of disease activity and progression. Recruitment, baseline assessment and follow up at year one is complete and longer term follow up is planned, beginning at five years after first visit. The study aims to explore the pathobiology and determinants of disease heterogeneity in MS. Here we describe the cohort design and present a profile of the participants at baseline and one year of follow up.","We present a compartment model that explains melanoma cell response and resistance to mono and combination therapies. Model parameters were estimated by utilizing an optimization algorithm to identify parameters that minimized the difference between predicted cell populations and experimentally measured cell numbers. The model was then validated with in vitro experimental data. Our simulations show that although a specific timing of the combination therapy is effective in controlling tumor cell populations over an extended period of time, the treatment eventually fails. We subsequently predict a more optimal combination therapy that incorporates an additional drug at the right moment.","Despite its major role in complex human behaviours across the lifespan, including memory formation and decline, navigation and emotions, much of the genetic architecture of the hippocampal formation is currently unexplored. Here, through multivariate genome-wide association analysis in volumetric data from 35,411 individuals, we revealed 173 unique genetic loci with distributed associations across the hippocampal formation. We identified profound genetic overlap with eight major developmental and degenerative brain disorders, where common genes suggest partly age- and disorder-independent mechanisms underlying hippocampal pathology.","Determining the contribution of elevated ultraviolet-B radiation (UVBR; 280 \u2013 315 nm) to amphibian population declines is being hindered by a lack of knowledge about how different acute UVBR exposure regimes during early life history stages might affect post-metamorphic stages via long-term carryover effects. We acutely exposed tadpoles of the Australian green tree frog (Litoria caerulea) to a combination of different UVBR irradiances and doses in a multi-factorial experiment, and then reared them to metamorphosis in the absence of UVBR to assess carryover effects in subsequent juvenile frogs. Dose and irradiance of acute UVBR exposure influenced carryover effects into metamorphosis in somewhat opposing manners. Higher doses of UVBR exposure in larvae yielded improved rates of metamorphosis. However, exposure at a high irradiance resulted in frogs metamorphosing smaller in size and in poorer condition than frogs exposed to low and medium irradiance UVBR as larvae. We also demonstrate some of the first empirical evidence of UVBR-induced telomere shortening in vivo, which is one possible mechanism for life-history trade-offs impacting condition post-metamorphosis. These findings contribute to our understanding of how acute UVBR exposure regimes in early life affect later life-history stages, which has implications for how this stressor may shape population dynamics.","Background Physical fitness (PF) is a powerful marker of health throughout the lifespan. In pregnant women, higher PF is associated with better maternal and fetal health, better delivery outcomes and earlier postpartum recovery. The assessment of PF during pregnancy requires special considerations to preserve fetal and maternal health; thus, providing a compilation of the most frequently used fitness tests, and assessing their validity, reliability, and association with maternal and neonatal health-related outcomes is of scientific and clinical interest.","Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have been recently developed for the estimation of Biological Age (BA), the hypothetical underlying age of an organism, which can differ from its chronological age (CA). Although promising, these population-specific algorithms warrant further characterization and validation, since their biological, clinical and environmental correlates remain largely unexplored.","Vitamin D functions as a potent immunomodulator by interacting with many immune cells however, its role in regulating inflammation in the epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is unclear. In the EAT of atherosclerotic microswine that were fed with deficient, sufficient or supplemented levels of vitamin D, we evaluated the phenotype of the macrophages. Vitamin D treatment was continued for 12 months and serum 25(OH)D levels were measured regularly. Infiltration of M1/M2 macrophage was investigated by immunostaining for CCR7 and CD206, respectively in conjunction with a pan macrophage marker CD14. Significant difference in the number of CCR7+ cells was observed in the EAT from vitamin D-deficient swine compared to vitamin D-sufficient or -supplemented swine. Expression of CD206 correlated with high levels of serum 25(OH)D indicating a significant increase in M2 macrophages in the EAT of vitamin D-supplemented compared to -deficient swine. These findings suggest that vitamin D-deficiency exacerbates inflammation by increasing pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages, while vitamin D-supplementation attenuates the inflammatory cytokines and promotes M2 macrophages in EAT. This study demonstrates the significance of vitamin D mediated inhibition of macrophage mediated inflammation in the EAT during coronary intervention in addition to its immunomodulatory role. However, additional studies are required to identify the cellular mechanisms that transduce signals between macrophages and smooth muscle cells during restenosis in the presence and absence of vitamin D.","Acquiring gait parameters from usual walking is important to predict clinical outcomes, including life expectancy, risk of fall, and neurocognitive performance, in older people. For comprehensive gait analysis, instruments such as marker-based motion analysis systems and walkways with pressure sensor arrays are necessary. Traditional instruments are bulky, complex, expensive, and intrinsically intrusive. Requirements of dedicated spaces for installation and specialized staff make it difficult to utilize traditional gait analysis instruments in most outpatient clinics. We present a novel gait analysis tool that is small, highly accurate, easy-to-use, and non-intrusive and is based on two-dimensional light detection and ranging technology. Using an object-tracking algorithm, we conducted a validation study of spatiotemporal tracking of ankle locations of subjects by comparing our tool with a gold standard modality. Our tool showed successful acquisition of gait parameters from usual walking motions and trackability with multiple targets in noisy conditions, including typical clinical environments.","Background Concerns have been expressed about a number of drugs that potentially worsen outcomes in patients with COVID-19. We sought to identify all potentially deleterious drug groups in COVID-19 and critically assess the underpinning strength of evidence pertaining to the harmful effects of these drugs.","Objectives The cultural beliefs, practices and experiences of ethnic minority groups, alongside structural inequalities and the political economy play a critical, but overlooked role in health promotion. The current study aims to address this deficit; understanding how these groups conceptualise COVID-19, and how this influences engagement in testing, with the future aim of developing targeted communications to address the challenges of testing uptake.","BACKGROUND Juvenile-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (JSLE) is an autoimmune disorder characterised by immune dysregulation, chronic inflammation and increased cardiovascular risk (CVR). Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in JSLE patients not attributable to disease flares. However, it is not possible to predict those patients at greatest risk using traditional CVR factors.","Unesterified cholesterol accumulation in the late endosomal/lysosomal (LE/LY) compartment is the cellular hallmark of Niemann-Pick C (NPC) disease, caused by defects in the genes encoding NPC1 or NPC2. We previously reported the dramatic stimulation of NPC2 cholesterol transport rates by the LE/LY phospholipid lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA) and in these studies sought to determine their functional relationship in normal LE/LY cholesterol egress. Here we demonstrate that NPC2 interacts directly with LBPA and identify the NPC2 hydrophobic knob domain as the site of interaction. Using its precursor phosphatidylglycerol (PG), we show that PG-induced LBPA enrichment results in clearance of accumulated cholesterol from NPC1-deficient cells but is ineffective in cells lacking functional NPC2. Together these studies reveal a heretofore unknown aspect of intracellular cholesterol trafficking, in which NPC2 and LBPA function together in an obligate step of sterol egress from the LE/LY compartment, which appears to be independent of NPC1.","Cholesterol is a critical component of membranes and a precursor for hormones and other signaling molecules. Previously, we showed that unlike astrocytes, glioblastoma cells do not downregulate cholesterol synthesis when plated at high density. In this report, we show that high cell density induces ABCA1 expression in glioblastoma cells, enabling them to get rid of excess cholesterol generated by an activated cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Because oxysterols are agonists for Liver X Receptors (LXRs), we investigated whether increased cholesterol activates LXRs to maintain cholesterol homeostasis in highly-dense glioblastoma cells. We observed that dense cells had increased oxysterols, which activated LXR\u03b2 to upregulate ABCA1. Cells with CRISPR-mediated knockdown of LXR\u03b2, but not ABCA1, had decreased cell cycle progression and cell survival, and decreased feedback repression of the mevalonate pathway in densely-plated glioma cells. LXR\u03b2 gene expression poorly correlates with ABCA1 in glioblastoma patients, and expression of each gene correlates with poor patient prognosis in different prognostic subtypes. Finally, gene expression and lipidomics analyses of crLXR\u03b2 cells revealed that LXR\u03b2 regulates the expression of immune response gene sets and lipids known to be involved in immune modulation. Thus, therapeutic targeting of LXR\u03b2 in glioblastoma might be effective through diverse mechanisms.","Seasonality of respiratory diseases has been linked, among other factors, to low outdoor absolute humidity and low relative humidity in indoor environments, which increase evaporation of water in the mucosal layer lining the respiratory tract. We demonstrate that normal breathing results in an absorption-desorption cycle inside facemasks, where super-saturated air is absorbed by the mask fibers during expiration, followed by evaporation during inspiration of dry environmental air. For double-layered cotton masks, which have considerable heat capacity, the temperature of inspired air rises above room temperature, and the effective increase in relative humidity can exceed 100%. We propose that the recently reported, disease-attenuating effect of generic facemasks is dominated by the strong humidity increase of inspired air.","OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to describe the frequency, causes, factors, and costs associated with right heart failure encounters.","Inter-chemical correlations in metabolomics and exposomics datasets provide valuable information for studying relationships among reported chemicals measured in human specimens. With an increase in the size of these datasets, a network graph analysis and visualization of the correlation structure is difficult to interpret. While co-regulatory genes databases have been developed, a similar database for metabolites and chemicals have not been developed yet. We have developed the Integrated Data Science Laboratory for Metabolomics and Exposomics - Chemical Correlation Database (IDSL.CCDB), as a systematic catalogue of inter-chemical correlation in publicly available metabolomics and exposomics studies. The database has been provided via an online interface to create single compound-centric views that are clear, readable and meaningful. We have demonstrated various applications of the database to explore: 1) the chemicals from a chemical class such as Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), phthalates and tobacco smoke related metabolites; 2) xenobiotic metabolites such as caffeine and acetaminophen; 3) endogenous metabolites (acyl-carnitines); and 4) unannotated peaks for PFAS. The database has a rich collection of 36 human studies, including the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and high-quality untargeted metabolomics datasets. IDSL.CCDB is supported by a simple, interactive and user-friendly web-interface to retrieve and visualize the inter-chemical correlation data. The IDSL.CCDB has the potential to be a key computational resource in metabolomics and exposomics facilitating the expansion of our understanding about biological and chemical relationships among metabolites and chemical exposures in the human body. The database is available at www.ccdb.idsl.me site.","Early predictions by computer simulation of 7 billion infections and 40 million deaths by COVID-19 during 2020 alone if lock-downs and other confining measures were not enforced may have justified restrictive policies mandated by governments of 165 countries. A main objective of the present study was to determine differences between the infection and death rate in countries that established early, nation-wide curfews, state-at-home orders, or lock-downs versus countries that did not mandate lock-downs to deal with the COVID-19 crisis.","Background Dermal fibrosis occurs in many human diseases, particularly systemic sclerosis (SSc) where persistent inflammation leads to collagen deposition and fiber formation in skin and multiple organs. The family of protein kinase D (PKD) has been linked to inflammatory responses in various pathological conditions, however, its role in inflammation-induced dermal fibrosis has not been well defined. Here, using a murine fibrosis model that gives rise to dermal lesions similar to those in SSc, we investigated the role of PKD in dermal fibrosis in mice lacking PKD2 activity.","Performance of systems used for patient cohort identification with electronic health record (EHR) data is not well-characterized. The objective of this research was to evaluate factors that might affect information retrieval (IR) methods and to investigate the interplay between commonly used IR approaches and the characteristics of the cohort definition structure.","Trans-ancestral variations exist for various anthropometric traits. These traits, including cardiovascular traits, are likely associated with different loci in individuals of different ancestry groups. We assessed the difference in systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate and maximum heart rate among African and European ancestry individuals. Furthermore, we conducted a genome-wide association study of cardiovascular traits in 383,471 Europeans and 5,978 Africans represented in the UK Biobank. Here, we report 2 and 1,202 variants associated with cardiovascular traits in Africans and Europeans, respectively. We identify 2 novel variants in Africans, including rs9388010 located in the GJA1 gene previously associated with numerous cardiomyopathies. Remarkably, we find the associated variants are primarily unique to each ancestry group and map to largely different genes. Through integrative enrichment analyses we find that gene sets within each ancestral group are significantly enriched for pathways and phenotypes related to cardiovascular physiology and disease. Our discoveries provide a better understanding of variations in cardiovascular traits and the different associated variants in Africans and Europeans.","The human kidney is composed of over 26 cell types that actively coordinate with each other to form higher-order structures, such as the nephron. It is not yet understood how these structures vary throughout a single organ or amongst the same organs within the human population. We have developed an extensive lipid and cellular atlas of the human kidney consisting of over 3 million cells comprising 75,000 functional tissue units (i.e., glomeruli, proximal tubules, distal tubules, and collecting ducts) from 13 human subjects. This atlas was developed using spatially registered and integrated technologies consisting of imaging mass spectrometry, multiplexed immunofluorescence, stained microscopy, and autofluorescence microscopy, to comprehensively probe large (i.e., centimeter-sized) areas of tissue. The cellular organization and lipid profiles of glomeruli, proximal tubules, distal tubules, and collecting ducts were discovered through these multimodal imaging data as well as their intra- and inter-subject variance. Relating the lipid profiles obtained from imaging mass spectrometry to distinct cell types obtained from immunofluorescence allowed us to hypothesize the functional role of specific phospholipids that have not previously been described. These hypotheses include subject characteristics, such as BMI and sex. The integrated data from the aforementioned datasets provide a valuable reference for kidney researchers, are publicly available through the NIH Human Biomolecular Atlas Program (https://portal.hubmapconsortium.org/), and discussed below.","The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has made a serious public health threat globally. To discover key molecular changes in COVID-19 and its secondary complications, we analyzed next-generation sequencing (NGS) data of COVID-19. NGS data (GSE163151) was screened and downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the present study, using DESeq2 package in R programming software. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis were performed, and the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, module analysis, miRNA-hub gene regulatory network and TF-hub gene regulatory network were established. Subsequently, receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was used to validate the diagonostics valuesof the hub genes. Firstly, 954 DEGs (477 up regulated and 477 down regulated) were identified from the four NGS dataset. GO enrichment analysis revealed enrichment of DEGs in genes related to the immune system process and multicellular organismal process, and REACTOME pathway enrichment analysis showed enrichment of DEGs in the immune system and formation of the cornified envelope. Hub genes were identified from the PPI network, module analysis, miRNA-hub gene regulatory network and TF-hub gene regulatory network. Furthermore, the ROC analysis indicate that COVID-19 and its secondary complications with following hub genes, namely, RPL10, FYN, FLNA, EEF1A1, UBA52, BMI1, ACTN2, CRMP1, TRIM42 and PTCH1, had good diagnostics values. This study identified several genes associated with COVID-19 and its secondary complications, which improves our knowledge of the disease mechanism.","Background and Objectives Many studies have examined the relation between PD and environmental variables serially --- one candidate association at a time. In the real world however, both environmental exposures and patients are much more complex, including correlated environmental exposures, polypharmacy, and complex comorbidities. Here we begin to characterize a holistic view of environmental, health, and pharmacological traits linked to patients with PD.","Progressive reduction in glutamatergic transmission has been proposed as an important component of the illness trajectory of schizophrenia. Despite its popularity, to date, this notion has not been convincingly tested in patients in early stages schizophrenia. In a longitudinal 7T magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS), we quantified glutamate at the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex in 21 participants with a median lifetime antipsychotic exposure of less than 3 days and followed them up after 6 months of treatment. Healthy controls were also scanned at two time points. While patients had significantly lower overall glutamate levels than healthy controls (F(1,27) = 5.23, p = 0.03), we did not observe a progressive change of glutamate concentration in patients (F(1,18) = 0.47, p = 0.50), and the group by time interaction was not significant (F(1,27) = 0.86, p = 0.36). On average, patients with early psychosis receiving treatment showed a 0.02 mM/year increase, while healthy controls showed a 0.06 mM/year reduction of MRS glutamate levels. Bayesian analysis of our observations does not support early, post-onset glutamate loss in schizophrenia. Interestingly, it provides evidence in favour of a lack of progressive glutamate change in our schizophrenia sample \u2013 indicating that the glutamatergic level at the onset of illness was the best predictor of the levels 6 months after treatment. A more nuanced view of glutamatergic physiology, linked to early cortical maturation, may be required to understand glutamatergic dynamics in schizophrenia.","Recent studies have indicated that extracellular vesicles (EV) may play a role in the pathogenesis of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). EV have been identified as potential biomarkers of disease severity and prognosis in other pulmonary diseases. We sought to characterize the EV phenotype within ARDS patient broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BAL), and to determine whether BAL EV could be utilized as a potential biomarker in ARDS. BAL was collected from sepsis patients with and without ARDS, and from esophagectomy patients post-operatively (of whom a subset later developed ARDS during hospital admission). BAL EV were characterized with regards to size, number and cell of origin. Sepsis patients with ARDS had significantly higher numbers of CD14+/CD81+ monocyte-derived BAL EV than sepsis patients without ARDS (p=0.015). However, the converse was observed in esophagectomy patients who later developed ARDS (p=0.003). Esophagectomy patients who developed ARDS also had elevated CD31+/CD63+ and CD31+/CD81+ endothelial-derived BAL EV (p\u22640.02) compared to esophagectomy patients who did not develop ARDS. Further studies are required to determine whether CD31+ BAL EV may be a predictive biomarker for ARDS in esophagectomy patients. CD14+/CD81+ BAL EV numbers were significantly higher in those patients with sepsis-related ARDS who died during the 30 days following ICU admission (p=0.027). Thus, CD14+/CD81+ BAL EV are a potential biomarker for disease severity and mortality in sepsis-related ARDS. These findings provide the impetus to further elucidate the contribution of these EV to ARDS pathogenesis.","The extent to which genetic influences on complex traits and disease are mediated by changes in DNA methylation levels has not been systematically explored. We developed an analytical framework that integrates genetic fine mapping and Mendelian randomization with epigenome-wide association studies to evaluate the causal relationships between methylation levels and 14 cardiovascular disease traits.","Mineral amount in bovine muscle affect meat quality, growth, health and reproductive traits in beef cattle. To better understand the genetic basis of this phenotype, we implemented new applications of use for two complementary algorithms: the partial correlation and information theory (PCIT) and the regulatory impact factor (RIF), by including GEBVs as part of the input. We used PCIT to determine putative regulatory relationships based on significant associations between gene expression and mineral amount. Then, RIF was used to determine the regulatory impact of genes and miRNA expression over mineral amount. We also investigated over-represented pathways, as well as evidences from previous studies carried in the same population, to determine regulatory genes for mineral amount e.g. NOX1, whose expression was positively correlated to Zn and was described as regulated by this mineral in humans. With this methodology, we were able to identify genes, miRNAs and pathways not yet described as important for mineral amount. The results support the hypothesis that extracellular matrix interactions are the core regulator of mineral amount in muscle cells. Putative regulators described here add information to this hypothesis, expanding the molecular relationships between gene expression and minerals.","Longitudinal bone growth occurs through endochondral ossification (EO), controlled by various signaling molecules. Retinoid X Receptor (RXR) is a nuclear receptor with important roles in cell death, development, and metabolism. However, little is known about its role in EO. In this study, the agonist SR11237 was used to evaluate RXR activation on EO.","Steroidogenesis is strictly regulated at multiple levels, as produced steroid hormones are crucial to maintain physiological functions. Cytochrome P450 enzymes are key players in adrenal steroid hormone biosynthesis and function within short redox-chains in mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. However, mechanisms regulating supply of reducing equivalents in the mitochondrial CYP-dependent system are not fully understood. In the present work, we aimed to estimate how the specific steroids, substrates, intermediates and products of multistep reactions modulate protein-protein interactions between adrenodoxin (Adx) and mitochondrial CYP11s. Using the SPR technology we determined that steroid substrates affect affinity and stability of CYP11s \u2013 Adx complexes in an isoform-specific mode. In particular, cholesterol induces a 4-fold increase in the rate of CYP11A1 \u2013 Adx complex formation without significant effect on dissociation (koff decreased ~1.5-fold), overall increasing complex affinity. At the same time steroid substrates decrease the affinity of both CYP11B1 \u2013 Adx and CYP11B2 \u2013 Adx complexes, predominantly reducing their stability (4-7 fold). This finding reveals differentiation of protein-protein interactions within the mitochondrial pool of CYPs, which have the same electron donor. The regulation of electron supply by the substrates might affect the overall steroid hormones production. Our experimental data provide further insight into protein-protein interactions within CYP-dependent redox chains involved in steroidogenesis.","Fine-mapping aims to identify causal variants impacting complex traits. Several recent methods improve fine-mapping accuracy by prioritizing variants in enriched functional annotations. However, these methods can only use information at genome-wide significant loci (or a small number of functional annotations), severely limiting the benefit of functional data. We propose PolyFun, a computationally scalable framework to improve fine-mapping accuracy using genome-wide functional data for a broad set of coding, conserved, regulatory and LD-related annotations. PolyFun prioritizes variants in enriched functional annotations by specifying prior causal probabilities for fine-mapping methods such as SuSiE or FINEMAP, employing special procedures to ensure robustness to model misspecification and winner\u2019s curse. In simulations with in-sample LD, PolyFun + SuSiE and PolyFun + FINEMAP were well-calibrated and identified &gt;20% more variants with posterior causal probability &gt;0.95 than their non-functionally informed counterparts (and &gt;33% more fine-mapped variants than previous functionally-informed fine-mapping methods). In simulations with mismatched reference LD, PolyFun + SuSiE remained well-calibrated when reducing the maximum number of assumed causal SNPs per locus, which reduces absolute power but still produces large relative improvements. In analyses of 49 UK Biobank traits (average N=318K) with in-sample LD, PolyFun + SuSiE identified 3,025 fine-mapped variant-trait pairs with posterior causal probability &gt;0.95, a &gt;32% improvement vs. SuSiE; 223 variants were fine-mapped for multiple genetically uncorrelated traits, indicating pervasive pleiotropy. We used posterior mean per-SNP heritabilities from PolyFun + SuSiE to perform polygenic localization, constructing minimal sets of common SNPs causally explaining 50% of common SNP heritability; these sets ranged in size from 28 (hair color) to 3,400 (height) to 2 million (number of children). In conclusion, PolyFun prioritizes variants for functional follow-up and provides insights into complex trait architectures.","The ionotropic glutamate delta receptor GluD1, encoded by the GRID1 gene, is involved in synapse formation, function, and plasticity. GluD1 does not bind glutamate, but instead cerebellin and D-serine, which allow the formation of trans-synaptic bridges, and trigger transmembrane signaling. Despite wide expression in the nervous system, pathogenic GRID1 variants have not been characterized in humans so far. We report homozygous missense GRID1 variants in five individuals from two unrelated consanguineous families presenting with intellectual disability and spastic paraplegia, without (p.Thr752Met) or with (p.Arg161His) diagnosis of glaucoma, a threefold phenotypic association whose genetic bases had not been elucidated previously. Molecular modeling indicated that Arg161His and Thr752Met mutations alter the hinge between GluD1 cerebellin and D-serine binding domains and the stiffness of this latter domain, respectively. Expression, trafficking, physical interaction with metabotropic glutamate receptor mGlu1, and cerebellin binding of GluD1 mutants were not conspicuously altered. Conversely, we found that both GluD1 mutants hampered signaling of metabotropic glutamate receptor mGlu1/5 via the ERK pathway in neurons of primary cortical culture. Moreover, both mutants impaired dendrite morphology and excitatory synapse density in neurons of primary hippocampal culture. These results show that the clinical phenotypes are distinct entities segregating in the families as an autosomal recessive trait, and caused by pathophysiological effects of GluD1 mutants involving metabotropic glutamate receptor signaling and neuronal connectivity. Our findings unravel the importance of the GluD1 receptor signaling in sensory, cognitive and motor functions of the human nervous system.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread across the globe with its consequent human and economic challenges. To achieve effective control of the pandemic, efforts need to be holistic and global. Understanding patients\u2019 demographics and clinical characteristics will assist in the control of the infection. However, there is a paucity of studies on the clinical presentation of COVID-19 patients from Nigeria and indeed Africa. Thus, this retrospective case series evaluated the medical records of COVID-19 patients admitted in a tertiary hospital in Nigeria. Patients\u2019 demographics, and other clinical variables were assessed and presented. Data of 14 patients with complete records were included in the study. Most of the patients (78.6%) were males and the mean age of the study participants is 63.5 years (SD; 11.5). The commonest presenting symptoms were fever (93%), cough (71.4%), and dyspnoea (57.1%). At presentation, 13 patients had coexisting diseases while 8 (57.0%) patients had moderate disease and the remaining 6 (43.0%) had severe cases. After management, 1 patient died, two were referred and 11 recovered and were discharged alive. Thus, this study has identified advanced age, male gender, and comorbidity as increased risk factors for hospitalisation. The patient survival outcome in this study was also good.","Importance Repurposing Ivermectin, a known anti-parasitic agent, for treating COVID-19 has demonstrated positive results in several studies. We aim to evaluate the benefit and risk of Ivermectin in COVID-19.","The dissection of factors that contribute to COVID-19 infection and severity has overwhelmed the scientific community for almost 2 years. Current reports highlight the role of in disease incidence, progression, and severity. Here, we aimed to confirm the presence of previously reported genetic variants in an admixed population. Allele frequencies were assessed and compared between the general population (N=3079) for which at least 30% have not been infected with SARS-CoV2 as per July 2021 versus COVID-19 patients (N=106).","Background In Kuwait, prior to the first case of COVID-19 being reported in the country, mass screening of incoming travelers from countries with known outbreaks was performed and resulted in the first identified cases in the country. All COVID-19 cases at the time and subsequently after, were transferred to a single center, Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Hospital, where the patients received standardized investigations and treatments. The objective of this study was to characterize the demographics, clinical manifestations and outcomes in this unique patient population.","COVID-19 is still placing a heavy health and financial burden worldwide. Impairments in patient screening and risk management play a fundamental role on how governments and authorities are directing resources, planning reopening, as well as sanitary countermeasures, especially in regions where poverty is a major component in the equation. An efficient diagnostic method must be highly accurate, while having a cost-effective profile.","Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a life-threatening disease occurring several weeks after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. MIS-C has overlapping clinical features with Kawasaki Disease (KD), a rare childhood vasculitis. MIS-C therapy is largely based on KD treatment protocols but whether these diseases share underpinning immunological perturbations is unknown. We performed deep immune profiling on blood samples from healthy children and patients with MIS-C or KD. Acute MIS-C patients had highly activated neutrophils, classical monocytes and memory CD8+ T-cells; increased frequencies of B-cell plasmablasts and CD27-IgD-double-negative B-cells; and increased levels of pro-inflammatory (IL6, IL18, IP10, MCP1) but also anti-inflammatory (IL-10, IL1-RA, sTNFR1, sTNFR2) cytokines. Increased neutrophil count correlated with inflammation,cardiac dysfunction and disease severity. Two days after intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment, MIS-C patients had increased CD163 expression on monocytes, expansion of a novel population of immature neutrophils, and decreased levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the blood accompanied by a transient increase in arginase in some patients. Our data show MIS-C and KD share substantial immunopathology and identify potential new mechanisms of action for IVIG, a widely used anti-inflammatory drug used to treat MIS-C, KD and other inflammatory diseases.","Background Several circulating biomarkers are reported to be associated with diabetic retinopathy (DR). However, their relative contributions to DR compared to known risk factors, such as hyperglycemia, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, remain unclear. In this data driven study, we used novel models to evaluate the associations of over 400 laboratory parameters with DR.","A meta-analysis showed a significant association between activated immune-inflammatory and nitro-oxidative (IO&amp;NS) pathways and suicide attempts (SA). There is no data on whether suicidal ideation (SI) is accompanied by activated IO&amp;NS pathways and whether there are differences between SA and SI. The current study searched PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science, for articles published from inception until May 10, 2021, and systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed the association between recent SA/SI (&lt; 3 months) and IO&amp;NS biomarkers. We included studies which compared psychiatric patients with and without SA and SI and controls (either healthy controls or patients without SA or SI) and used meta-analysis (random-effect model with restricted maximum-likelihood) to delineate effect sizes with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Our search included 59 studies comprising 4.034 SA/SI cases and 12.377 controls. Patients with SA/SI showed activated IO&amp;NS pathways (SMD: 0.299; CI: 0.200; 0.397) when compared to controls. The immune profiles were more strongly associated with SA than with SI, particularly when compared to healthy controls, as evidenced by activated IO&amp;NS (SMD: 0.796; CI: 0.503; 1.089), immune (SMD: 1.409; CI: 0.637; 1.462), inflammatory (SMD: 1.200; CI: 0.584; 1.816), and neurotoxic (SMD: 0.904; CI: 0.431; 1.378) pathways. The effects sizes of the IO&amp;NS, immune and inflammatory profiles were significantly greater in SA than in SI. In conclusion: increased neurotoxicity due to inflammation and nitro-oxidative stress and lowered neuroprotection explains at least in part why psychiatric patients show increased SA and SI. The IO&amp;NS pathways are more pronounced in recent SA than in SI.","Several studies have identified biomarkers for tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis based on blood cell transcriptomics. Here, we instead studied epigenomics in the lung compartment by obtaining induced sputum from subjects included in a TB contact tracing. CD3- and HLA-DR-positive cells were isolated from the collected sputum and DNA methylome analyses performed. Unsupervised cluster analysis revealed that DNA methylomes of cells from TB-exposed individuals and controls appeared as separate clusters and the numerous genes that were differentially methylated were functionally connected. The enriched pathways were strongly correlated to data from published work on protective heterologous immunity to TB. Taken together, our results demonstrate that epigenetic changes related to trained immunity occurs in the pulmonary immune cells of TB-exposed individuals and that a DNA methylation signature can be derived from the DNA methylome. Such a signature can be further developed for clinical use as a marker of TB exposure.","The metabolic signaling pathways that drive pathologic tissue inflammation and damage in humans with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) are not well understood. Using combined methods in plasma high-resolution metabolomics, lipidomics and cytokine profiling from a multicohort study of humans with pulmonary TB disease, we discovered that IL-1\u03b2-mediated inflammatory signaling was closely associated with TCA cycle remodeling, characterized by accumulation of the pro-inflammatory metabolite succinate and decreased concentrations of the anti-inflammatory metabolite itaconate. This inflammatory metabolic response was particularly active in persons with multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB that received 2 months of ineffective treatment and was only reversed after 1 year of appropriate anti-TB chemotherapy. Both succinate and IL-1\u03b2 were significantly associated with proinflammatory lipid signaling, including increases in the products of phospholipase A2, increased arachidonic acid formation, and metabolism of arachidonic acid to proinflammatory eicosanoids. Together, these results indicate that decreased itaconate and accumulation of succinate and other TCA cycle intermediates are important drivers of IL-1\u03b2-mediated proinflammatory eicosanoid signaling in humans with pulmonary TB disease. Host-directed therapies that mitigate such metabolic reprograming have potential to limit pulmonary inflammation and tissue damage.","Most colorectal cancers (CRCs) develop from either adenomas (ADs) or sessile serrated lesions (SSLs). The origins and molecular landscapes of these histologically distinct pre-cancerous polyps remain incompletely understood. Here, we present an atlas at single-cell resolution of sporadic conventional tubular/tubulovillous ADs, SSLs, hyperplastic polyps (HPs), microsatellite stable (MSS) and unstable (MSI-H) CRC, and normal colonic mucosa. Using single-cell transcriptomics and multiplex imaging, we studied 69 datasets from 33 participants. We also examined separate sets of 66 and 274 polyps for RNA and targeted gene sequencing, respectively. We performed multiplex imaging on a tissue microarray of 14 ADs and 15 CRCs, and we integrated pre-cancer polyp data with published single-cell and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) bulk CRC data to establish potential polyp-cancer relationships. Striking differences were observed between ADs and SSLs that extended to MSS and MSI-H CRCs, respectively, reflecting their distinct origins and trajectories. ADs arose from WNT pathway dysregulation in stem cells, which aberrantly expanded and expressed a Hippo and ASCL2 regenerative program. In marked contrast, SSLs were depleted of stem cell-like populations and instead exhibited a program of gastric metaplasia in the setting of elevated cytotoxic inflammation. Using subtype-specific gene regulatory networks and shared genetic variant analysis, we implicated serrated polyps, including some HPs conventionally considered benign, as arising from a metaplastic program in committed absorptive cells. ADs and SSLs displayed distinct patterns of immune cell infiltration that may influence their natural history. Our multi-omic atlas provides novel insights into the malignant potential of colorectal polyps and serves as a framework for precision surveillance and prevention of sporadic CRC.","Evolutionary trends may underlie some aspects of the risk for common, non-communicable disorders, including psychiatric disease. We analyzed whole exome sequencing data from 80 unique individuals from India coming from families with two or more individuals with severe mental illness. We used Population Branch Statistics (PBS) to identify variants and genes under positive selection and identified 75 genes as candidates for positive selection. Of these, 20 were previously associated with Schizophrenia, Alzheimer\u2019s disease and cognitive abilities in genome wide association studies. We then checked whether any of these 75 genes were involved in common biological pathways or related to specific cellular or molecular functions. We found that immune related pathways and functions related to innate immunity such as antigen binding were over-represented. We also evaluated for the presence of Neanderthal introgressed segments in these genes and found Neanderthal introgression in a single gene out of the 75 candidate genes. However, the introgression pattern indicates the region is unlikely to be the source for selection. Our findings hint at how selection pressures in individuals from families with a history of severe mental illness may diverge from the general population. Further, it also provides insights into the genetic architecture of severe mental illness, such as schizophrenia and its link to immune factors.","Despite decades of research and advancements in diagnostics and treatment, tuberculosis remains a major public health concern, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. New bioinformatics and computational methods are needed to interrogate the intersection of host- and bacterial genomes and identify novel targets for anti-tuberculosis drugs. Host genotype datum and paired infecting bacterial isolate information were analysed for associations using a multinomial logistic regression framework implemented in SNPTest. Two geographically distinct cohorts were evaluated: a cohort of 947 participants self-identifying as belonging to a five-way admixed South African population and a Ghanaian cohort consisting of 3 311 participants. We report potential associations between host genetic variants and multiple members of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC). Although none of the variants analyzed in the South African cohort passed the GWAS cut-off for significance, 32 single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified in the Ghanaian cohort as being statistically significantly associated with risk for infection with strains of different members of the MTBC. Further analysis revealed that two of these SNPs were directly genotyped, and the rest were imputed using the 1000 Genomes Phase 3 reference panel. The availability of paired host-pathogen data is imperative for investigating strain-specific interactions between MTBC and its host. As demonstrated by this study, the implementation of a multinomial logistic regression using paired host-pathogen data may prove valuable for further research investigating the complex relationships driving infectious disease.","Backgrounds and aims: Transfer RNA (tRNA) is the most extensively modified RNA in cells. Queuosine (Q)-modification is a fundamental process for fidelity and efficiency of translation from RNA to proteins. In eukaryotes, tRNA-Q-modification relies on the intestinal microbial product queuine. However, the roles and potential mechanisms of Q-tRNA modifications in IBD are unknown. Methods: We explored the Q-tRNA modifications and expression of Q tRNA ribosyltransferase catalytic subunit 1 (QTRT1) in patients with IBD by investigating human biopsies and reanalyzing datasets. We used colitis models, organoids, and cultured cells for loss- and gain-of-function studies to investigate the molecular mechanisms of Q-tRNA modifications in the intestinal inflammation. Results: QTRT1 expression was significantly downregulated in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease patients. The four Q-tRNA-related tRNA synthetases (asparaginyl-, aspartyl-, histidyl-, and tyrosyl- tRNA synthetase) were decreased in IBD patients. This reduction was further confirmed in DSS-induced colitis and IL10-deficient mice. Reduced QTRT1 was significantly correlated with cell proliferation and intestinal junctions, including downregulated beta-catenin and Claudin-5 and upregulated Claudin-2. These alterations were confirmed in vitro by deleting QTRT1 from cells. Queuine treatment significantly enhanced cell proliferation and junction functions in cell lines and human colonoids. Queuine treatment also reduced inflammation in epithelial cells. Moreover, altered QTRT1-related metabolites were found in human IBD. Conclusion: tRNA modifications play an unexplored novel role in the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation by altering epithelial proliferation and junctions. Investigations on tRNA modification will uncover novel molecular mechanisms for potential prevention and therapy for IBD.","Vitamin D deficiency is a candidate risk factor for a range of adverse health outcomes. In a genome-wide association study of 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentration in 417,580 Europeans we identified 143 independent loci in 112 1-Mb regions providing new insights into the physiology of vitamin D and implicating genes involved in (a) lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, (b) dermal tissue properties, and (c) the sulphonation and glucuronidation of 25OHD. Mendelian randomization models found no robust evidence that 25OHD concentration had causal effects on candidate phenotypes (e.g. BMI, psychiatric disorders), but many phenotypes had (direct or indirect) causal effects on 25OHD concentration, clarifying the relationship between 25OHD status and health.","Mycobacterium tuberculosis when phagocytosed by macrophages is not cleared completely and many of the bacteria remain in phagosomes indefinitely. In this study we considered abnormal retention of filamentous actin on early phagosomes contributing to defective phagosome acidification. Phosphocofilin1, the inactive form of actin depolymerizing protein cofilin1, which leads to retention of filamentous actin, and the total filamentous actin itself were found upregulated in macrophages infected with virulent M. tuberculosis. Over expression of constitutively active cofilin1 in macrophages was found to increase phagosome acidification when infected with virulent M. tuberculosis. The anticancer drug sorafenib which activates cofilin1 in PI3K dependent manner was also found to increase phagosome acidification. Cofilin1, known to be positively regulated by superoxide was found to be downregulated by ESAT-6 of M. tuberculosis where the latter is known to reduce ROS in macrophages. Ectopic expression of ESAT-6 in macrophages was found to increase filamentous actin and to transform the macrophages more spindle shaped. ESAT-6 was also found to decrease phagosome acidification in macrophages infected with an avirulent M. tuberculosis strain. Finally, this study proposes a role for the amino acid methionine in resisting ROS by creating M93 mutants of ESAT-6.","","Host innate immune cells, including alveolar macrophages, have been identified as key players in the early eradication of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and in the maintenance of an anti-mycobacterial immune memory, which is believed to be induced through epigenetic changes. The aim of the study was to elucidate whether exposure to M. tuberculosis induced a different DNA methylation pattern of alveolar macrophages and pulmonary T lymphocytes.","Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecological malignancy in women, and it is likely to metastasize and has a poor prognosis. The early and reliable diagnosis and monitoring of ovarian cancer is very important. Without a homeostasis mechanism, urine can reflect early systemic changes in the body and has a great potential to be used for the early detection of cancer. This study tested whether early changes could be detected in two ovarian cancer rat models. Two rat models were established by either intraperitoneal (i.p.) or orthotopic (o.t.) injection of NuTu-19 ovarian cancer cells in female Fischer344 rats. Urine samples from ovarian cancer rats were collected at five time points during cancer development, and urinary proteins from the rats were profiled by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Compared with pre-injection samples, 49 differential proteins that have human orthologues were significantly changed in the orthotopically injected model. Among them, 24 of the differential proteins have previously been reported to be associated with ovarian cancer, six of which were reported to be biomarkers of ovarian cancer. On the 7th day after orthotopic injection, four differential proteins (APOA1, OX2G, CHMP5, HEXB) were identified before obvious metastases appeared. In the intraperitoneal injection model, 76 differential proteins were changed during the course of ovarian cancer development. The results show that urine proteins could enable the early detection and monitoring of ovarian cancer progression and could lay a foundation for further exploration of the biomarkers of ovarian cancer.","The role of individual factors in the progressing of degenerative and dystrophic changes of articular cartilage as the focus of pathologic changes in posttraumatic osteoarthrosis (PTOA) has been studied comprehensively. However, no single concept of pathogenetic mechanisms leading to the formation of permanent changes in the affected joint has been represented yet. Therefore, the investigation of lipid peroxidation and skeletal tissues metabolism in animals with simulated PTOA is a challenging and important issue.","Background Adults at high risk of fragility fracture should be offered pharmacological treatment when not contraindicated, however under-treatment is common.","Literature on adolescent depression is not only rich in content and diverse in form, but also scattered and complex in structure. However, there is no dynamic development analysis and evolution analysis related to the topic. Therefore, this study drew a topic landscape map and predicted the prevalence of topics in the future.","Background The amount of published in vivo studies and the speed researchers are publishing them make it virtually impossible to follow the recent development in the field. Systematic review emerged as a method to summarise and analyse the studies quantitatively and critically but it is often out-of-date due to its lengthy process.","Mushrooms are versatile materials with applications including but not limited to food, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical industries. In this work, the potential of the common button mushroom, Agaricus bisporus, as a protective agent against ultraviolet exposure was assessed. The assessment was done by investigating the radical scavenging activity, sun protecting capability, and tyrosinase inhibiting properties of Agaricus bisporus ethanolic extract. The extraction was carried out using absolute ethanol as its solvent at low to room temperatures. The bioactive components of the ethanolic extract were analysed for its phenolic and flavonoid contents quantitatively, while other phytochemical agents were analysed qualitatively. The Agaricus bisporus ethanolic extract was found exhibit varying degree of activity in all of the assessment. We found low radical scavenging ability with %RSA IC50 of \u223c5456 \u03bcg/mL, low to moderate sun protecting factor of \u223c5.355 at 5000 ppm concentration, and high tyrosinase inhibition property with IC50 of \u223c2 \u03bcg/mL. The high tyrosinase inhibition property was found to correlate with relatively high total phenolic content of \u223c1143 mg GAE/100g for Agaricus bisporus and the presence of terpenoid in the ethanolic extract.","Very-long chain omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA) have anti-inflammatory properties that may help reduce morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 infection. We conducted a pilot study in 100 patients to test the hypothesis that RBC EPA+DHA levels (the Omega-3 Index, O3I) would be inversely associated with risk for death by analyzing the O3I in banked blood samples drawn at hospital admission. To have adequate power (&gt;80%) in this pilot study, we pre-specified a significance level of 0.10. Fourteen patients died, one of 25 in quartile 4 (Q4) (O3I \u22655.7%) and 13 of 75 in Q1-3. After adjusting for age and sex, the odds ratio for death in patients with an O3I in Q4 vs Q1-3 was 0.25, p=0.07. Thus, we have suggestive evidence that the risk for death from COVID-19 was lower in those with the highest O3I levels. These preliminary findings need to be confirmed in larger studies.","SARS-CoV-2 infection has a high transmission level. At the present time there is not a specific treatment approved but it is known that, in vitro, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine can inhibit the coronavirus.","Background Current form of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is inadequate to accurately explain the genetics of complex traits due to the lack of sufficient statistical power. It explores each variant individually, but current studies show that multiple variants with varying effect sizes actually act in a concerted way to develop a complex disease. To address this issue, we have developed an algorithmic framework that can effectively solve the multi-locus problem in GWAS with a very high level of confidence. Our methodology consists of three novel algorithms based on graph theory and machine learning. It identifies a set of highly discriminating variants that are stable and robust with little (if any) spuriousness. Consequently, likely these variants should be able to interpret missing heritability of a convoluted disease as an entity.","Introduction/Aims The ability of low intensity vibration (LIV) to combat skeletal decline in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) was evaluated in a randomized controlled trial.","In this paper, I used multivariate linear regression analysis to determine if latitude and ozone concentration predict Covid-2019 cases in 34 countries worldwide. Data pertaining to Covid-2019 cases were extracted from Worldometer. Ozone concentration levels were taken from the open-access database of World Ozone and Ultraviolet Radiation Data Centre (WOUDC). Latitude of specific area where measurement took place was also provided in the database. Preliminary Kendall rank correlation test revealed that Covid-2019 incidence was positively and significantly related to ozone concentration; however, incidence was not significantly related to latitude. Using multivariate linear regression, a statistically significant link between ozone concentration and Covid-2019 incidence in 34 countries was established; however, I found no statistical association between latitude and Covid-2019 incidence refuting previous claims. Prompt health actions should be developed for areas with high ozone concentration in the present and possibly, future outbreaks; however, extensive laboratory analysis should be conducted to further confirm the findings of the study. Nevertheless, the results of this study could serve as a basis for further clinical and large-scale studies.","Objective To explore risk factors associated with COVID-19 susceptibility and survival in patients with pre-existing hepato-pancreato-biliary (HPB) conditions.","The filaggrin gene (FLG) is essential for skin differentiation and epidermal barrier formation with links to skin diseases, however it has a highly repetitive nucleotide sequence containing very limited stretches of unique nucleotides for precise mapping to reference genomes. Sequencing strategies using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and conventional Sanger sequencing have been successful for complete FLG coding DNA sequence amplification to identify pathogenic mutations but this time-consuming, labour intensive method has restricted utility. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) offers obvious benefits to accelerate FLG analysis but standard re-sequencing techniques such as oligoprobe-based exome or customized targeted-capture can be expensive, especially for a single target gene of interest. We therefore designed a protocol to improve FLG sequencing throughput using a set of FLG-specific PCR primer assays compatible with microfluidic amplification, multiplexing and current NGS protocols. Using DNA reference samples with known FLG genotypes for benchmarking, this protocol is shown to be concordant for variant detection across different sequencing methodologies. We applied this methodology to analyze cohorts from ethnicities previously not studied for FLG variants and demonstrate usefulness for discovery projects. This comprehensive coverage sequencing protocol is labour-efficient and offers an affordable solution to scale up FLG sequencing for larger cohorts. Robust and rapid FLG sequencing can improve patient stratification for research projects and provide a framework for gene specific diagnosis in the future.","Protein homeostasis is crucial for viability of all organisms, and mutations that enhance protein aggregation cause different human pathologies, including polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases, such as some spinocerebellar ataxias or Huntington disease. Here, we report that neuronal Stomatin-like protein UNC-1 protects against aggregation of prone-to-aggregate proteins, like polyQs, \u03b1-synuclein and \u03b2-amyloid, in C. elegans. UNC-1, in IL2 neurons, antagonizes the function of the cytosolic sulfotransferase SSU-1 in neurohormonal signalling from ASJ neurons. The target of this hormone is the nuclear hormone receptor NHR-1, which acts cell-autonomously to protect from aggregation in muscles. A second nuclear hormone receptor, DAF-12, functions oppositely to NHR-1 to maintain protein homeostasis. Transcriptomics analyses reveal deep changes in the expression of genes involved in fat metabolism, in unc-1 mutants, which are regulated by NHR-1. This suggest that fat metabolism changes, controlled by neurohormonal signalling, contributes to modulate protein homeostasis.","Human gut microbiome composition is shaped by multiple host intrinsic and extrinsic factors, but the relative contribution of host genetic compared to environmental factors remains elusive. Here, we genotyped a cohort of 696 healthy individuals from several distinct ancestral origins and a relatively common environment, and demonstrate that there is no statistically significant association between microbiome composition and ethnicity, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), or overall genetic similarity, and that only 5 of 211 (2.4%) previously reported microbiome-SNP associations replicate in our cohort. In contrast, we find similarities in the microbiome composition of genetically unrelated individuals who share a household. We define the term biome-explainability as the variance of a host phenotype explained by the microbiome after accounting for the contribution of human genetics. Consistent with our finding that microbiome and host genetics are largely independent, we find significant biome-explainability levels of 16-33% for body mass index (BMI), fasting glucose, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, waist circumference, waist-hip ratio (WHR), and lactose consumption. We further show that several human phenotypes can be predicted substantially more accurately when adding microbiome data to host genetics data, and that the contribution of both data sources to prediction accuracy is largely additive. Overall, our results suggest that human microbiome composition is dominated by environmental factors rather than by host genetics.","Rational Infection with the SARS-CoV2 virus is associated with elevated neutrophil counts. Evidence of neutrophil dysfunction in COVID-19 is based predominantly on transcriptomics or single functional assays. Cell functions are interwoven pathways, and so understanding the effect of COVID-19 across the spectrum of neutrophil function may identify tractable therapeutic targets.","Endeavors to identify potentially protective variables for COVID-19 impact on certain populations have remained a priority. Multiple attempts have been made to attribute the reduced COVID-19 impact on populations to their bacillus Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccination coverage ignoring the fact that the effect of childhood BCG vaccination wanes within 5 years while most of the COVID-19 cases and deaths have occurred in aged with comorbidities. Since the supposed protection being investigated could come from heterologous \u2018trained immunity\u2019 (TI) conferred by exposure to Mycobacterium spp. (i.e., environmental and BCG), it is argued that the estimates of the prevalence of TI of populations currently available as latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) prevalence would be a better variable to evaluate such assertions. Indeed, when we analyze the European populations (twenty-four), and erstwhile East and West Germany populations completely disregarding their BCG vaccination coverage, the populations with higher TI prevalence consistently display reduced COVID-19 impact as compared to their lower TI prevalence neighbors. The TI estimates of the populations not the BCG coverage per se, negatively correlated with pandemic phase-matched COVID-19 incidences (r(24): - 0.79 to -0.57; p-value: &lt;0.004), mortality (r(24): -0.63 to -0.45; p-value: &lt;0.03), and interim case fatality rates(i-CFR) data. To decisively arrive at dependable conclusions about the potential protective benefit gained from BCG vaccination in COVID-19, the ongoing/planned randomized controlled trials should consciously consider including measures of TI as - a) all individuals immunized do not respond equally, b)small study groups from higher background TI could fail to indicate any protective effect.","Vitamin D deficiency is an endemic problem existing worldwide. Although several strategies were established to enhance vitamin D3 levels, studies specifically focussing inhibition of vitamin D metabolism which may prolong the availability of active vitamin D in pathological conditions are less explored. Studies also suggest that higher doses of vitamin D3 fail to achieve optimum vitamin D levels. In this context, we focussed on the enzyme CYP3A4 which promotes inactivation of active vitamin D. The current study was aimed to decipher the impact of chrysin, a proven CYP3A4 inhibitor as an intervention and its effects in combination with low dose vitamin D3 (40 IU) and bone health in vitamin D deficiency condition. The in-vivo activity of chrysin was evaluated on female Wistar albino rats fed with a vitamin D deficient diet to attain vitamin D deficiency for 28 days. Chrysin was given alone and in combination with calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and/or vitamin D3. All the therapeutic interventions were assessed for serum 25-OH-D3 by LC-MS, biochemical, urinary, and bone parameters. Animals treated with chrysin alone and in combination with low dose vitamin D3 and/or CaCO3 showed an eminent rise in serum 25-OH-D3 levels along with increased serum biochemical parameters. On contrary, a significant decrease in the urinary parameters followed by beneficial effects on bone parameters was noticed in contrast with the vitamin D deficient diet group. Our findings revealed that although chrysin alone showed a notable effect on 25-OH-D3 and osseous tissue, comparatively it showed intensified therapeutic effect in combination with vitamin D3 and CaCO3 which can be employed as a cost-effective option to improve bone health.","Several reports emphasized the importance of inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) in hindering osteoblast differentiation and bone matrix mineralization. Its ubiquitous presence is thought to prevent \u201csoft\u201d tissue calcification, whereas its degradation to Pi in bones and teeth by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) may facilitate crystal growth. While the inhibiting role of PPi on osteoblast differentiation and function is largely understood, less is known about its effects on osteoclast determination and activity. In this study, we investigated the role of PPi in bone resorption using calverial organ cultures ex vivo. We present an evidence that PPi stimulated calvarial bone resorption marked by calcium (Ca2+) release in the condition media (CM). We then examined PPi effects on osteoclast differentiation using mouse bone marrow-derived monocytes (BMMs). Our results revealed that PPi enhanced osteoclast differentiation ex vivo, marked by increased number and size of TRAP-stained mature osteoclasts. Moreover, PPi stimulated osteoclastogenesis in BMMs co-cultured with osteoblasts. These data supported the increased osteoclast activity in bone resorption using functional osteo-assays. The finding of PU.1-Egr-1 dependent up-regulation of c-FMS and RANK receptors in BMMs supported the enhanced pre-osteoclast commitment and differentiation. Moreover, osteoclast survival was enhanced by activation of MITF-BCL-2 pathway that was mediated by MAPK-ERK1/2 signaling. Last, our data showed that PPi up-regulated ANK; PPi transporter, during osteoclast differentiation through ERK1/2 phosphorylation whereas mutation of ANK inhibited osteoclastogenesis. Collectively, our data suggest that PPi promotes osteoclast differentiation, survival, and function through PU.1 up-regulation and MITF phosphorylation whereas ANK loss-of-function inhibited osteoclastogenesis.","Aims Statins are recommended as first-line treatment to prevent cardiovascular disease, but high rates of adverse events and subsequent discontinuation can prevent effective treatment in some patients. We aimed to describe the intensity, nature and frequency of adverse effects caused by statins and other lipid-lowering drugs, and to assess their association with clinical predictors and treatment strategies.","CRISPR/Cas9 system has become a new versatile technology for genome engineering. It utilizes a single guide RNA (sgRNA) to recognize target sequences in genome function, and activates Cas9 endonucleases to cut the locus. In this study, we designed two target sites from conserved regions of vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene in mammalian cells, which cover more than 17 kb of chromosome region depending on the species. The efficacy of single sgRNA mediated gene specific modification was about 22% to 36%. Concurrently, targeted deletions of the intervening genomic segments were generated in chromosomes when the two sgRNAs worked simultaneously. The large genomic DNA segments ranging from 17.8Kb to 23.4 Kb could be precisely deleted in human and mouse chromosomes. Furthermore, the expression level of 24-hydroxylase (CYP24A1) regulated by VDR was significantly increased in cells treated with VDR CRISPR/Cas9 vectors. This study showed that CRISPR/Cas9 system can be employed to generate large genomic segment deletions in different species, providing sgRNAs are designed within conserved regions.","The pharmacodynamics effects of therapeutically administered calcitonin is observed for extended duration much beyond its reported short half-life. The rationale for this pharmacodynamic-pharmacokinetics mismatch of calcitonin is not known. Hence in this study the hypothesis on sub-compartmentalization of calcitonin in blood to explain the extended pharmacodynamics effects of calcitonin was evaluated in vitro using the sheep blood model. A relatively higher proportion of calcitonin concentration was observed in the WBC compartment. The partition coefficient analysis showed levels of calcitonin to be higher on WBC membrane compared to intracellular. Molecular modelling to assess the binding of calcitonin with protein in plasma and WBC membranes indicated physiologically relevant higher affinity with beta-2-microglobulin\u2019s in plasma and glycoproteins (CD44), sushi domains (CD25), fibronectins (CD206) and siglecs (CD22) on WBC membrane. The physiologically relevant higher affinity with several proteins on WBC membrane and plasma can be responsible for extended pharmacodynamics effects observed for therapeutically administered calcitonin.","Male MS-NASH mice were maintained on a high-fat diet for 16 weeks with and without red algae-derived minerals. Obeticholic acid (OCA) was used as a comparator in the same strain and diet. C57BL/6 mice maintained on a standard (low-fat) rodent chow diet were used as a control. At the end of the in-life portion of the study, body weight, liver weight, liver enzyme levels and liver histology were assessed. Samples obtained from individual livers were subjected to Tandem Mass Tag labeling / mass spectroscopy for protein profile determination. As compared to mice maintained on the low-fat diet, all high-fat-fed mice had increased whole body and liver weight, increased liver enzyme (aminotransferases) levels and widespread steatosis / ballooning hepatocyte degeneration. Histological evidence for liver inflammation and collagen deposition was also present, but changes were to a lesser extent. A moderate reduction in ballooning degeneration and collagen deposition was observed with mineral supplementation. Control mice on the high-fat diet alone demonstrated multiple protein changes associated with dysregulated fat and carbohydrate metabolism, lipotoxicity and oxidative stress. Cholesterol metabolism and bile acid formation were especially sensitive to diet. In mice receiving multi-mineral supplementation along with the high-fat diet, there was reduced liver toxicity as evidenced by a decrease in levels of several cytochrome P450 enzymes and other oxidantgenerating moieties. Additionally, elevated expression of several keratins was also detected in mineral-supplemented mice. The protein changes observed with mineral supplementation were not seen with OCA. Our previous studies have shown that mice maintained on a high-fat diet for up to 18 months develop end-stage liver injury including hepatocellular carcinoma. Mineral-supplemented mice were substantially protected against tumor formation and other end-state consequences of high-fat feeding. The present study identifies early (16-week) protein changes occurring in the livers of the high-fat diet-fed mice, and how the expression of these proteins is influenced by mineral supplementation. These findings help elucidate early protein changes that contribute to end-stage liver injury and potential mechanisms by which dietary minerals may mitigate such damage.","OBJECTIVE To study the effect of weather on severity indicators of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19).","Psoriasis is an inflammatory skin disease with strong immune cell infiltration and high levels of the antimicrobial peptide, LL37. LL37 was shown to complex DNA and RNA to activate plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) in vitro and this has been thought to drive interferon-mediated disease exacerbation. However, the physiological source of such nucleic acids and thus an early initiating event for nucleic-acid mediated inflammation remains unknown. We hypothesized that neutrophils (PMNs), which dominate the psoriatic skin infiltrate, may be the source of DNA and LL37 as well-established components of so-called neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). We show here that indeed primary murine and human PMNs mount a fulminant NET and cytokine response, albeit not via DNA-but rather RNA-LL37 complexes. This was dependent on TLR8/TLR13 and sensitive to TLR inhibitory oligodeoxynucleotides. Unexpectedly, copious amounts of RNA were identified as a so far unappreciated NET component in vitro and in psoriatic but not healthy skin. Importantly, RNA-LL37-triggered NETs, when transferred to na\u00efve PMNs, prompted additional de novo NET release. Our study highlights TLR-mediated RNA-LL37 sensing by PMNs as parts of a self-propagating vicious cycle that may later engulf pDC and establish chronic inflammation in psoriasis and NET-associated RNA (naRNA) as a physiologically relevant novel component.","Optimal cardiac function requires appropriate contractile proteins in each heart chamber. Atria require slow myosins to act as variable reservoirs, while ventricles demand fast myosin for swift pumping functions. Hence, myosin is under chamber-biased cis-regulatory control to achieve this functional distribution. Failure in proper regulation of myosin genes can lead to severe congenital heart dysfunction. The precise regulatory input leading to cardiac chamber-biased expression remains uncharted. To address this, we computationally and molecularly dissected the quail Slow Myosin Heavy Chain III (SMyHC III) promoter that drives specific gene expression to the atria to uncover the regulatory information leading to chamber expression and understand their evolutionary origins. We show that SMyHC III gene states are autonomously orchestrated by a complex nuclear receptor cis-regulatory element (cNRE), a 32- bp sequence with hexanucleotide binding repeats. Using in vivo transgenic assays in zebrafish and mouse models, we demonstrate that preferential atrial expression is achieved by the combinatorial regulatory input composed of atrial activation motifs and ventricular repression motifs. Through comparative genomics, we provide evidence that the cNRE emerged from an endogenous viral element, most likely through infection of an ancestral host germline. Our study reveals an evolutionary pathway to cardiac chamber-specific expression.","With newer data for SARS-CoV-2 and entering the second wave of contagion required the improvement of the forecasting model, structuring its model to forecast the peak of the first and second contagion wave in Brazil. The Brazilian model estimation for SARS-CoV-2 peak contagion (BMESPC) was structured, capable of estimating the peak of contagion for SARS-CoV-2 in the first and second waves, as the main objective of this work. Using the BMESPC model, it was possible to estimate, with a certain reliability degree, the peak of contagion for the first and second waves in Brazil, with one day difference from the real to the forecast. While at the state level, the calculated confidence interval proved to be more accurate. In this way, it is possible to use BMESPC to forecast the peak of contagion for several regions, provided that the necessary structure and calibration are respected.","Most genome-wide association and fine-mapping studies to date have been conducted in individuals of European descent, and genetic studies of populations of Hispanic/Latino and African ancestry are still limited. In addition to the limited inclusion of these populations in genetic studies, these populations have more complex linkage disequilibrium structure that may reduce the number of variants associated with a phenotype. In order to better define the genetic architecture of these understudied populations, we leveraged &gt;100,000 phased sequences available from deep-coverage whole genome sequencing through the multi-ethnic NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program to impute genotypes into admixed African and Hispanic/Latino samples with commercial genome-wide genotyping array data. We demonstrate that using TOPMed sequencing data as the imputation reference panel improves genotype imputation quality in these populations, which subsequently enhances gene-mapping power for complex traits. For rare variants with minor allele frequency (MAF) &lt; 0.5%, we observed a 2.3 to 6.1-fold increase in the number of well-imputed variants, with 11-34% improvement in average imputation quality, compared to the state-of-the-art 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 and Haplotype Reference Consortium reference panels, respectively. Impressively, even for extremely rare variants with sample minor allele count &lt;10 (including singletons) in the imputation target samples, average information content rescued was &gt;86%. Subsequent association analyses of TOPMed reference panel-imputed genotype data with hematological traits (hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), and white blood cell count (WBC)) in ~20,000 self-identified African descent individuals and ~23,000 self-identified Hispanic/Latino individuals identified associations with two rare variants in the HBB gene (rs33930165 with higher WBC (p=8.1\u00d710\u221212) in African populations, rs11549407 with lower HGB (p=1.59\u00d710\u221212) and HCT (p=1.13\u00d710\u22129) in Hispanics/Latinos). By comparison, neither variant would have been genome-wide significant if either 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 or Haplotype Reference Consortium reference panels had been used for imputation. Our findings highlight the utility of TOPMed imputation reference panel for identification of novel associations between rare variants and complex traits not previously detected in similar sized genome-wide studies of under-represented African and Hispanic/Latino populations.","The placenta is a fast-evolving organ with large morphological and histological differences across eutherians, but the genetic changes driving placental evolution have not been fully elucidated. Transposable elements, through their capacity to quickly generate genetic variation and affect host gene regulation, may have helped to define species-specific trophoblast gene expression programmes. Here, we assessed the contribution of transposable elements to human trophoblast gene expression as enhancers or promoters. Using epigenomic data from primary human trophoblast and trophoblast stem cell lines, we identified multiple endogenous retrovirus families with regulatory potential that lie close to genes with preferential expression in trophoblast. These largely primate-specific elements are associated with inter-species gene expression differences, and are bound by transcription factors with key roles in placental development. Using genetic editing we demonstrated that several elements act as transcriptional enhancers of important placental genes, such as CSF1R and PSG5. We also identified an LTR10A element that regulates ENG expression, affecting secretion of soluble ENG, with potential implications for preeclampsia. Our data show that transposons have made important contributions to human trophoblast gene regulation, and suggest that their activity may affect pregnancy outcomes.","Background Indonesia has an ageing population that can develop mobility health-related problems in the future, including osteoporosis, arthritis, sarcopenia, low back pain, neck pain, and peripheral neuropathy. However, there are limited references and research that look upon mobility health and problems surrounding it in Indonesia.","Intravenous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) is used in equine practice to treat hypomagnesemia, dysrhythmias, neurological disorders, and calcium dysregulation. MgSO4 is also used as a calming agent in equestrian events. Hypercalcemia affects calcium-regulating hormones, as well as plasma and urinary electrolytes; however, the effect of hypermagnesemia on these variables is unknown. The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of hypermagnesemia on blood parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcitonin (CT), ionized calcium (Ca2+), ionized magnesium (Mg2+), sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), chloride (Cl-) and their urinary fractional excretion (F) after intravenous administration of MgSO4 in healthy horses. Twelve healthy female horses of 4-18 years of age and 432-600 kg of body weight received a single intravenous dose of MgSO4 (60 mg/kg) over 5 minutes, and blood and urine samples were collected at different time points over 360 minutes. Plasma Mg2+ concentrations increased 3.7-fold over baseline values at 5 minutes and remained elevated for 120 minutes (P &lt; 0.05), Ca2+ concentrations decreased from 30-60 minutes (P &lt; 0.05), but Na+, K+ and Cl- concentrations did not change. Serum PTH concentrations dropped initially to rebound and remain elevated from 30 to 60 minutes, while CT concentrations increased at 5 minutes to return to baseline by 10 minutes (P &lt; 0.05). The FMg, FCa, FNa, FK, and FCl increased, while urine osmolality decreased from 30-60 minutes compared baseline (P &lt; 0.05). Experimental hypermagnesemia alters calcium-regulating hormones (PTH, CT), reduces plasma Ca2+ concentrations, and increases the urinary excretion of Mg2+, Ca2+, K+, Na+ and Cl- in healthy horses. This information has clinical implications on the short-term effects of hypermagnesemia on calcium-regulating hormones as well as plasma and urine electrolytes.","The MED1 subunit of the Mediator complex is an essential coactivator of nuclear receptor-mediated transcriptional activation. While structural requirements for ligand-dependent binding of classical coactivator motifs of MED1 to numerous nuclear receptor ligand-binding domains have been fully elucidated, the recognition of the full-length or truncated coactivator by full nuclear receptor complexes remain unknown. Here we present structural details of the interaction between a large part of MED1 comprising its structured N-terminal and the flexible receptor-interacting domains and the mutual heterodimer of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and the retinoid X receptor (RXR) bound to their cognate DNA response element. Using a combination of structural and biophysical methods we show that the ligand-dependent interaction between VDR and the second coactivator motif of MED1 is crucial for complex formation and we identify additional, previously unseen, interaction details. In particular, we identified RXR regions involved in the interaction with structured N-terminal domain of MED1, as well as VDR regions outside the classical coactivator binding cleft affected by coactivator recruitment. These findings highlight important roles of each receptor within the heterodimer in selective recognition of MED1 and contribute to our understanding of the nuclear receptor-coregulator complexes.","Background Trans fats remain on the market in parts of the world. Emerging evidence suggests that factors beyond calorie balance may affect fat deposition and body mass index (BMI). Trans fats are prooxidant, proinflammatory, and have shown adverse metabolic effects and increased fat deposition in animals.","Psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia are commonly associated with structural brain alterations affecting the cortex, which frequently vary with clinically relevant factors including antipsychotic treatment, duration of illness and age of onset. While the underlying variables mediating these structural changes are poorly understood, recent genetic evidence suggests circulating metabolites and other biochemical traits play a causal role in a number of psychiatric disorders which could be mediated by changes in the cerebral cortex. In the current study, we leveraged publicly available genome-wide association study (GWAS) data to explore shared genetic architecture and evidence for causal relationships between a panel of 50 biochemical traits and measures of cortical thickness and surface area at both the global and regional levels. Linkage disequilibrium score regression identified a total of 20 significant and 156 suggestive genetically correlated biochemical-cortical trait pairings, of which six exhibited strong evidence for causality in a latent causal variable model. Interestingly, a negative causal relationship was identified between a unit increase in serum C-reactive protein levels and thickness of the lingual and lateral occipital regions that was also supported by Mendelian randomisation, while circulating vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D) levels exhibited a positive causal effect on temporal pole thickness. Taken together, our findings suggest a subset of biochemical traits exhibit shared genetic architecture and potentially causal relationships with cortical thickness in functionally distinct regions, which may contribute to alteration of cortical structure in psychiatric disorders.","Objective The present study aimed to measure the prevalence and incidence of stress, depression, and anxiety symptoms in Brazilians during the COVID-19 pandemic.","  Outcome-dependent sampling designs are common in many different scientific\nfields including epidemiology, ecology, and economics. As with all\nobservational studies, such designs often suffer from unmeasured confounding,\nwhich generally precludes the nonparametric identification of causal effects.\nNonparametric bounds can provide a way to narrow the range of possible values\nfor a nonidentifiable causal effect without making additional untestable\nassumptions. The nonparametric bounds literature has almost exclusively focused\non settings with random sampling, and the bounds have often been derived with a\nparticular linear programming method. We derive novel bounds for the causal\nrisk difference, often referred to as the average treatment effect, in six\nsettings with outcome-dependent sampling and unmeasured confounding for a\nbinary outcome and exposure. Our derivations of the bounds illustrate two\napproaches that may be applicable in other settings where the bounding problem\ncannot be directly stated as a system of linear constraints. We illustrate our\nderived bounds in a real data example involving the effect of vitamin D\nconcentration on mortality.\n","Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are involved in development of diabetes. However, the impact of excessive glucose on CTL-mediated antigen-independent killing remains elusive. Here, we report that TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) is substantially up- regulated in CTLs in environments with high glucose (HG) both in vitro and in vivo. The PI3K- Akt-NF\u03baB axis and non-mitochondrial reactive oxygen species are essential in HG-induced TRAIL upregulation in CTLs. TRAILhigh CTLs induce apoptosis of pancreatic beta cell line 1.4E7. Metformin and Vitamin D synergistically reduce HG-enhanced expression of TRAIL in CTLs and coherently protect 1.4E7 cells from TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Notably, in patients with diabetes, correlation between Vitamin D concentrations in plasma and glucose levels is linked to HG-enhanced TRAIL expression on CTLs. Microarray data reveal that OXCT2, an important enzyme in ketone body catabolism, is a promising target in response to vitamin D. Our work not only reveals a novel mechanism of CTL involvement in progression of diabetes, but also establishes CTLs as a target for combined metformin and vitamin D therapy to protect pancreatic beta cells of diabetic patients.","Background Invasive lobular breast carcinoma (ILC), the second most prevalent histological subtype of breast cancer, exhibits unique molecular features compared with the more common invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). While genomic and transcriptomic features of ILC and IDC have been characterized, genome-wide chromatin accessibility pattern differences between ILC and IDC remain largely unexplored.","Mendelian Randomization (MR) is an important approach to modelling causality in non-experimental settings. MR uses genetic instruments to test causal relationships between exposures and outcomes of interest. Individual genetic variants have small effects, and so, when used as instruments, render MR liable to weak instrument bias. Polygenic scores have the advantage of larger effects, but may be characterized by direct pleiotropy, which violates a central assumption of MR.","To assess the utility of online patient self-report outcomes in a rare disease, we attempted to observe the effects of corticosteroids in delaying age at fulltime wheelchair use in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) using data from 1,057 males from DuchenneConnect, an online registry. Data collected were compared to prior natural history data in regard to age at diagnosis, mutation spectrum, and age at loss of ambulation. Because registrants reported differences in steroid and other medication usage, as well as age and ambulation status, we could explore these data for correlations with age at loss of ambulation. Using multivariate analysis, current steroid usage was the most significant and largest independent predictor of improved wheelchair-free survival. Thus, these online self-report data were sufficient to retrospectively observe that current steroid use by patients with DMD is associated with a delay in loss of ambulation. Comparing commonly used steroid drugs, deflazacort prolonged ambulation longer than prednisone (median 14 years and 13 years, respectively). Further, use of Vitamin D and Coenzyme Q10, insurance status, and age at diagnosis after 4 years were also significant, but smaller, independent predictors of longer wheelchair-free survival. Nine other common supplements were also individually tested but had lower study power. This study demonstrates the utility of DuchenneConnect data to observe therapeutic differences, and highlights needs for improvement in quality and quantity of patient-report data, which may allow exploration of drug/therapeutic practice combinations impractical to study in clinical trial settings. Further, with the low barrier to participation, we anticipate substantial growth in the dataset in the coming years.","Background Food insecurity is defined as the limited or uncertain availability of enough food for a consistently active and healthy life. COVID-19 is a highly transmissible viral infection with high mortality due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and, or the uncommon severe pneumonia. This study assesses the relationship between food security and dietary patterns status with COVID-19 in the North Khorasan province, Iran.","Background Autonomic dysfunction is a common complication of post-acute sequalae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC)/long COVID, however prevalence and severity rates are unknown.","The microbiota play critical roles in regulating the function and health of intestine and extraintestinal organs. A fundamental question is whether there is an intestinal-microbiome-breast axis during the development of breast cancer. If yes, what are the roles of host factors? Vitamin D receptor (VDR) involves host factors and the human microbiome. Vdr gene variation shapes the human microbiome and VDR deficiency leads to dysbiosis. We hypothesized that intestinal VDR protects hosts against tumorigenesis in breast. Reduced VDR mRNA expression was observed in patients with breast cancer. We used a 7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA)-induced breast cancer model in intestinal epithelial VDR knockout (VDR\u0394IEC) mice. We reported that VDR\u0394IEC mice with dysbiosis are more susceptible to breast cancer induced by DMBA. Intestinal and breast microbiota analysis showed that lacking VDR leads to bacterial profile shift from normal to susceptible carcinogenesis.  We found enhanced bacterial staining within breast tumors. At the molecular and cellular levels, we identified the mechanisms by which intestinal epithelial VDR deficiency led to increased gut permeability, disrupted tight junctions, microbial translocation, and enhanced inflammation, thus increasing the tumor size and number in breast. Furthermore, treatment with beneficial bacterial metabolite butyrate or probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum reduced the breast tumors, enhanced the tight junctions, and inhibited inflammation in the VDR\u0394IEC mice. Gut microbiome contribute to the pathogenesis of diseases, not only in the intestine, but also in the breast. Our study provides new insights into the mechanism by which intestinal VDR dysfunction and gut dysbiosis led to high risk of extraintestinal tumorigenesis. Gut-tumor-microbiome interactions indicate a new target in the prevention and treatment of breast cancer.","Context Through its immunological functions, vitamin D attenuates inflammatory responses to respiratory viruses. Vitamin D deficiency might be a highly prevalent risk factor for severe SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Background While COVID-19 remains largely unclear and mortality continues to raise, early effective approaches prior to complications lack, as well as researches for characterization and therapeutical potential options in actual early COVID-19. Although females seem to be less affected than females, hyperandrogenic (HA) phenotype, like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), idiopathic hirsutism, congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) female androgenetic alopecia (AGA), or idiopathic HA may be at higher risk due to its inherent enhanced androgenic activity. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of any early pharmacological approach to females diagnosed with COVID-19 before seven days of symptoms, as well as investigate whether HA is an additional risk factor in this population.","Background The accuracy of identifying sarcoidosis cases in electronic medical records (EMR) using diagnostic codes is unknown.","Aim To evaluate associations of plasma 25(OH)D status with the likelihood of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection and hospitalization.","Brevibacillus texasporus peptide (BT peptide) is immunomodulatory in poultry as a feed additive to substitute antibiotics. In the present study we performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing to compare development of the cecal microbial communities in Clostridium perfringens-challenged broilers fed basal diet only or with either BT peptide (48 ppm) or antibiotics mixture (20 ppm bacitracin zinc and 40 ppm colistin sulfate). 240 chicks were randomly assigned into each treatment and a total of 65 cecal samples were collected at the beginning, during seven challenge days and one week post challenge. The composition of microbial communities was clearly distinguishable over time. Treatments with challenge and the antibiotics mixture were associated with increased diversity and with higher relative abundances of Alistipes sp. CHKCI003 and Faecalibacterium and lower abundance of Escherichia coli (all p &lt; 0.05). At the termination of the trial, the cecal microbiota in broilers supplemented with BT peptide was dominated by members of Bacteroidaceae. Predicted function analysis reveals significant enrichment of genes involved in ion-coupled transporters and sugar and biotin metabolism in the BT peptide treatment. Taken together, our results suggest that BT peptide and commonly used antibiotics have different influences on modulating the composition of cecal microbiota in broilers.","Background EBV infection is thought to play a central role in the development of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). If causal, it represents a target for interventions to reduce MS risk.","Disproportionate distal limb shortening is the hallmark of acromelic dysplasias. Among them, geleophysic dysplasia is a rare, frequently lethal condition characterized by severe short stature, musculoskeletal, cardiac, pulmonary, and skin anomalies. Geleophysic dysplasia results from dominant fibrillin-1 (FBN1) or recessive ADAMTSL2 mutations, suggesting a functional link between ADAMTSL2 and FBN1. Mice lacking ADAMTSL2 die at birth, precluding analysis of postnatal skeletal growth and mechanisms underlying the skeletal anomalies of geleophysic dysplasia. We show that Adamtsl2 is expressed in limb soft tissues, predominantly in tendon. Expression in developing bones is limited to their terminal cell layers that are destined to become articular cartilage and is absent in growth plate cartilage. Adamtsl2 conditional deletion in limb mesenchyme using Prxl-Cre led to an acromelic dysplasia, providing a suitable model for investigation of geleophysic dysplasia. Unexpectedly, conditional Adamtsl2 deletion using Scx-Cre, a tendon-specific deleter, also impaired skeletal growth. Specific morphogenetic anomalies were seen in Achilles tendon, along with FBN1 accumulation. Thus, ADAMTSL2, shown here to bind fibrillin microfibrils in vitro, limits fibrillin microfibril formation in tendons and promotes tendon growth. The findings suggest that reduced bone growth in geleophysic dysplasia results from external tethering by short tendons rather than intrinsic growth plate anomalies.","Anti-cancer uses of non-oncology drugs have been found on occasion, but such discoveries have been serendipitous and rare. We sought to create a public resource containing the growth inhibitory activity of 4,518 drugs tested across 578 human cancer cell lines. To accomplish this, we used PRISM, which involves drug treatment of molecularly barcoded cell lines in pools. Relative barcode abundance following treatment thus reflects cell line viability. We found that an unexpectedly large number of non-oncology drugs selectively inhibited subsets of cancer cell lines. Moreover, the killing activity of the majority of these drugs was predictable based on the molecular features of the cell lines. Follow-up of several of these compounds revealed novel mechanisms. For example, compounds that kill by inducing PDE3A-SLFN12 complex formation; vanadium-containing compounds whose killing is dependent on the sulfate transporter SLC26A2; the alcohol dependence drug disulfiram, which kills cells with low expression of metallothioneins; and the anti-inflammatory drug tepoxalin, whose killing is dependent on high expression of the multi-drug resistance gene ABCB1. These results illustrate the potential of the PRISM drug repurposing resource as a starting point for new oncology therapeutic development. The resource is available at https://depmap.org.","The origins of congenital heart diseases, the most common congenital diseases are still largely unknown. Environmental factors are now emerging as major causes of these diseases. Vitamin D deficiency has become a public health burden, notably for childbearing age, pregnant and breastfeeding women. Since maternal 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) determined fetal and neonatal 25(OH)D status, foetuses exposed to insufficient levels of vitamin D, may feature developmental defects.","Specific alterations of gut microbiota (GM) in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients, including elevated microbial diversity, particularly perturbed composition, imbalanced microbial function, and associated metabolic pattern modifications have been described in our previous report. The current work aimed to assess the association of GM composition with AF recurrence (RAF) after ablation, and to construct a GM-based predictive model for RAF. Gut microbial composition and metabolic profiles were assessed based on metagenomic sequencing and metabolomic analyses. Compared with non-AF controls (50 individuals), GM composition and metabolomic profile were significantly altered between patients with recurrent AF (17 individuals) and the non-RAF group (23 individuals). Notably, discriminative taxa between the non-RAF and RAF groups, including the families Nitrosomonadaceae and Lentisphaeraceae, the genera Marinitoga and Rufibacter, and the species Faecalibacterium sp. CAG:82, Bacillus gobiensis, and Desulfobacterales bacterium PC51MH44, were selected to construct a taxonomic scoring system based on LASSO analysis. An elevated area under curve (0.954) and positive net reclassification index (1.5601) for predicting RAF compared with traditional clinical scoring (AUC=0.6918) were obtained. The GM-based taxonomic scoring system theoretically improves the model performance. These data provide novel evidence that supports incorporating the GM factor into future recurrent risk stratification.","Tissue microarrays (TMAs) have been used in thousands of cancer biomarker studies. To what extent batch effects, measurement error in biomarker levels between slides, affects TMA-based studies has not been assessed systematically. We evaluated 20 protein biomarkers on 14 TMAs with prospectively collected tumor tissue from 1,448 primary prostate cancers. In half of the biomarkers, more than 10% of biomarker variance was attributable to between-TMA differences (range, 1\u201348%). We implemented different methods to mitigate batch effects (R package batchtma), tested in plasmode simulation. Biomarker levels were more similar between mitigation approaches compared to uncorrected values. For some biomarkers, associations with clinical features changed substantially after addressing batch effects. Batch effects and resulting bias are not an error of an individual study but an inherent feature of TMA-based protein biomarker studies. They always need to be considered during study design and addressed analytically in studies using more than one TMA.","Background The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) first identified in Wuhan in December 2019 became a pandemic within a few months of its discovery. The impact of COVID-19 is due to both its rapid spread and its severity, but the determinants of severity have not been fully delineated.","Background As in other countries, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected Norway\u2019s immigrant population disproportionately with significantly higher infection rates and hospitalizations. The reasons for this are uncertain.","","Background Vitamin D inadequacy affects almost 50% of adults in the United States and is associated with numerous adverse health effects. Vitamin D concentration [25(OH)D] is a complex trait with genetic and environmental predictors that work in tandem to influence 25(OH)D and may determine how much vitamin D intake is required to reach an optimal 25(OH)D concentration. To date, there has been little investigation into how genetics and environment interact to affect 25(OH)D.","We present an exploratory cross-sectional analysis of the effect of season and weather on Freesurfer-derived brain volumes from a sample of 3,279 healthy individuals collected on two MRI scanners in Hartford, CT, USA over a 15 year period. Weather and seasonal effects were analyzed using a single linear regression model with age, sex, motion, scan sequence, time-of-day, month of the year, and the deviation from average barometric pressure, air temperature, and humidity, as covariates. FDR correction for multiple comparisons was applied to groups of non-overlapping ROIs. Significant negative relationships were found between the left- and right-cerebellum cortex and pressure (t = \u22122.25, p = 0.049; t = \u22122.771, p = 0.017). Significant positive relationships were found between left- and right-cerebellum cortex and white matter between the comparisons of January/June and January/September. Significant negative relationships were found between several subcortical ROIs for the summer months compared to January. An opposing effect was observed between the supra- and infra-tentorium, with opposite effect directions in winter and summer. Cohen\u2019s d effect sizes from monthly comparisons were similar to those reported in recent psychiatric big-data publications, raising the possibility that seasonal changes and weather may be confounds in large cohort studies. Additionally, changes in brain volume due to natural environmental variation have not been reported before and may have implications for weather-related and seasonal ailments.","Besides its functions in the skeletomuscular system, vitamin D also promotes protective immunity against viral pathogens. Viral sensing by mammalian cells triggers nuclear activation of RelA/NF-\u03baB and IRF3 factors, which collaborate in mediating the early induction of antiviral type 1 interferons (T1-IFNs). Autocrine T1-IFN signaling further accumulates otherwise negligibly expressed IRF7 in virus-infected cells that then sustains T1-IFN production in a positive feedback. Surprisingly, prior cell-culture studies revealed that vitamin D actually suppresses signal-induced RelA activation. Indeed, it remains unclear how vitamin D limits viral multiplication in a cell-autonomous manner. Here, we examined the role of vitamin D in controlling cellular infections by the Chandipura virus (CHPV), a cytoplasmic RNA virus implicated in human epidemics. We found that vitamin D conditioning produced an altered cell state less permissive for CHPV multiplication because of the heightened expression of T1-IFNs. It is thought that viruses also induce a distinct RelB/NF-\u03baB activity, which counteracts RelA-driven T1-IFN expressions in infected cells. Our analyses instead characterized a basal nuclear RelB activity, which was downregulated upon vitamin D-mediated suppression of RelB synthesis. Interestingly, this vitamin D-RelB pathway provoked IRF7-mediated positive autoregulation augmenting constitutive T1-IFN expressions even in the absence of viral infections. Accordingly, RelB deficiency rendered redundant, while IRF7 depletion abrogated antiviral vitamin D actions. In sum, our study suggests that the homeostatic state of the signaling circuitry comprising of the NF-\u03baB and T1-IFN pathways connects micronutrients to antiviral immunity at the cellular level.","Background Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder in which the respiratory system gets clogged with mucus leads to progressive lung damage. There is no known cure for CF but several treatments to manage symptoms and reduce complications. Vitamin D deficiency is common in CF associated with increased infection and inflammation. This systematic review and meta-analysis will evaluate the effectiveness of vitamin D treatment in reducing respiratory tract infection and inflammation in patients with CF.","Background Herbal medicinal products have a long-standing history of use in the therapy of common respiratory infections. In the COVID-19 pandemic, they may have the potential for symptom relief in non-severe or moderate disease cases. Here we describe the results derived by in vitro screening of five herbal medicinal products with regard to their potential to i) interfere with the binding of the human Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 protein, ii) modulate the release of the human defensin HBD1 and cathelicidin LL-37 from human A549 lung cells upon Spike S1 protein stimulation and iii) modulate the release of IFN-\u03b3 from activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The investigated extracts were: Sinupret extract (SINx), Bronchipret thyme-ivy (BRO TE), Bronchipret thyme-primrose (BRO TP), Imupret (IMU), and Tonsipret (TOP).","Aims Histological examination of the rib is of critical value in perinatal pathology and points to the health of the child preceding death. The rib is considered ideal because it is the most rapidly growing long bone in infants and demonstrates growth arrest at onset of the insult. We aimed to identify: 1: changes in the perichondrial ring in the rib of infants and children up to 16 months of age dying suddenly at our institution and 2: any association with presence of histological changes of vitamin D deficiency (VDD) /metabolic bone disease (MBD) in the growth plate.","The structure and integrity of the ageing brain is interchangeably linked to physical health, and cardiometabolic risk factors (CMRs) are associated with dementia and other brain disorders. In this mixed cross-sectional and longitudinal study (interval mean and standard deviation = 19.7 \u00b1 0.5 months), including 1062 datasets from 790 healthy individuals (mean (range) age = 46.7 (18-94) years, 54% women), we investigated CMRs and health indicators including anthropometric measures, lifestyle factors, and blood biomarkers in relation to brain structure using MRI-based morphometry and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We performed tissue specific brain age prediction using machine learning and performed Bayesian multilevel modelling to assess changes in each CMR over time, their respective association with brain age gap (BAG), and their interaction effects with time and age on the tissue-specific BAGs. The results showed credible associations between DTI-based BAG and blood levels of phosphate and mean cell volume (MCV), and between T1-based BAG and systolic blood pressure, smoking, pulse, and C-reactive protein (CRP), indicating older-appearing brains in people with higher cardiometabolic risk (smoking, higher blood pressure and pulse, low-grade inflammation). Longitudinal evidence supported interactions between both BAGs and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and between DTI-based BAG and systolic blood pressure and smoking, indicating accelerated ageing in people with higher cardiometabolic risk (smoking, higher blood pressure, and WHR). The results demonstrate that cardiometabolic risk factors are associated with brain ageing. While randomised controlled trials are needed to establish causality, our results indicate that public health initiatives and treatment strategies targeting modifiable cardiometabolic risk factors may also improve risk trajectories and delay brain ageing.","Retrotransposons are genetic elements capable of their own propagation and insertion into the human genome. Because of their mutagenic potential, retrotransposons are heavily suppressed by mechanisms including DNA methylation. Increased age is associated with decreasing DNA methylation of the LINE-1 retrotransposon and may partially explain the predisposition towards malignancy with advancing age. Vitamin D has been investigated for its effects on DNA methylation at LINE-1 elements with mixed results. This study hypothesised that LINE-1 DNA methylation is altered by vitamin D exposure and age. Using whole genome bisulfite sequencing of adult and newborn haematopoietic progenitors, DNA methylation at LINE-1 elements was not found to vary between cells cultured with or without calcitriol, both in adults and newborns. In contrast, several LINE-1 regions were found to be differentially methylated between adults and children, but these were not uniformly hypermethylated in paediatric cells. The results of this study suggest that at least in haematopoietic cells, vitamin D does not appear to affect LINE-1 methylation.","Background Vitamin D levels have been reported to be associated with COVID-19 susceptibility, severity and mortality events.. We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the use of vitamin D intervention on COVID-19 outcomes.","Background Altered gait is a frequent feature of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), as is vitamin D deficiency. Treatment with memantine and vitamin D can protect cortical axons from exposure to amyloid-\u03b2 and glutamate toxicity, suggesting this combination may mitigate altered gait in AD.","Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to a reduction in skeletal muscle function and oxidative capacity, however, the mechanistic basis of these impairments are poorly understood. The biological actions of vitamin D are carried out via the binding of 1\u03b1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1\u03b1,25(OH)2D3) to the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Recent evidence has linked 1\u03b1,25(OH)2D3 to the regulation of skeletal muscle mitochondrial function in vitro, however, little is known with regard to the role of the VDR in this process. To examine the regulatory role of the VDR in skeletal muscle mitochondrial function, we utilised lentiviral mediated shRNA silencing of the VDR in C2C12 myoblasts (VDR-KD) and examined mitochondrial respiration and protein content compared to shRNA scrambled control. VDR protein content was reduced by ~95% in myoblasts and myotubes (P &lt; 0.001). VDR-KD myoblasts displayed a 30%, 30% and 36% reduction in basal, coupled and maximal respiration respectively (P &lt; 0.05). This phenotype was maintained in VDR-KD myotubes, displaying a 34%, 33% and 48% reduction in basal, coupled and maximal respiration (P &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, ATP production derived from oxidative phosphorylation (ATPox) was reduced by 20% suggesting intrinsic impairments within the mitochondria following VDR-KD. However, despite the observed functional decrements, mitochondrial protein content as well as markers of fusion and fission were unchanged. In summary, we highlight a direct role for the VDR in regulating skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration in vitro, providing a potential mechanism as to how vitamin D deficiency might impact upon skeletal muscle oxidative capacity.","Leptin is a body weight regulatory hormone, but it is arguably even more potent at regulating blood glucose levels. To further our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which leptin controls glucose homeostasis, we have used transgenic zebrafish models and conditional deletion of beta catenin in the mediobasal hypothalamus of adult mice to show that Wnt signalling in the brain mediates glucoregulatory effects of leptin. In zebrafish, under normal feeding conditions, leptin regulates glucose homeostasis but not adipostasis. In times of nutrient excess, we found that leptin also regulates body weight and size in this species. Using a Wnt signalling reporter fish, we show that leptin directly activates the canonical Wnt pathway in vivo. Pharmacological inhibition of this pathway prevented the leptin-induced improvement in glucose tolerance. In adult mice, conditional deletion of the key Wnt effector molecule, \u03b2-catenin, in the mediobasal hypothalamus of male mice confirmed the essential role of the Wnt pathway in mediating leptin action and the neuroendocrine regulation of glucose homeostasis. Adult-onset \u03b2-catenin deletion in the mediobasal hypothalamus led to glucose intolerance, exacerbation of caloric intake and body weight gain under high fat diet, as well as resistance to exogenous leptin.","Schizophrenia patients show increased disabilities and lower quality of life (DisQoL). Nevertheless, there are no data whether, in schizophrenia, activation of the interleukin (IL)-6, IL-23, T helper (Th)-17 axis and lowered magnesium and calcium levels impact DisQoL scores. This study recruited 90 patients with schizophrenia (including 40 with deficit schizophrenia) and 40 healthy controls and assessed the World Health Association QoL instrument-Abbreviated version and Sheehan Disability scale, Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS), IL-6, IL-23, IL-17, IL-21, IL-22, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, magnesium and calcium. Regression analyses showed that a large part of the first factor extracted from the physical, psychological, social and environmental HR-QoL and interference with school/work, social life, and home responsibilities was predicted by a generalized cognitive deterioration (G-CoDe) index (a latent vector extracted from BACs scores), and the first vector extracted from various symptom domains (\u201csymptomatome\u201d), whereas the biomarkers had no effects. Partial Least Squares analysis showed that the IL6IL23Th17 axis and magnesium/calcium had highly significant total (indirect + direct) effects on HR-QoL/disabilities which were mediated by G-CoDe and the symptomatome (a first factor extracted from negative and positive symptoms). The IL6IL23Th17 axis explained 63.1% of the variance in a single latent trait extracted from G-CoDe, symptomatome, HR-QoL and disability data. The latter features are manifestations of a common core, namely the behavioral-cognitive-psycho-social worsening index, which is caused by the neuroimmunotoxic effects of the IL6IL23Th17 axis in subjects with lowered antioxidant defenses (magnesium and calcium) thereby producing damage to neuronal circuits underpinning deficit schizophrenia.","Although a vast knowledge has already been gathered on the pathophysiology of COVID-19, there are still limited, non-optimal treatment options. In this paper, we describe a multicentre, retrospective, observational study to describe the course of SARS-CoV-2 disease in patients treated with ImmunoFormulation (IF), an add-on therapy developed to decrease duration of clinical symptoms. In parallel, a group of patients that did not receive IF was used for comparison (using standard of care treatment). A total of 39 patients were evaluated. Throughout the observational period, 90% of patients recovered in the IF cohort and 47.4% in the Control cohort (p=0.0057). From the symptoms with statistically significant differences, the duration of symptoms (i.e., the time to recover from it) was shorter in the IF cohort than in control cohort (in days, average), especially for fever (2.25 x 21.78), dry cough (4.38 x 24.00), dyspnoea (3.67 x 20.00), headache (2.00 x 26.50), diarrhoea (5.25 x 25.25), and weakness (1.92 x 23.30). This demonstrates a potential promising role of IF as adjuvant therapy on the evolution of symptomatology to COVID-19 patients.","Introduction Immunosenescence leads to increased morbidity and mortality associated with viral infections and weaker vaccine responses. This has been well documented for seasonal influenza and the current pandemic with Sars-Cov2, which disproportionately impact older adults, particularly those in residential aged care facilities. Inadequate nutrient intake associated with impaired immunity, respiratory and muscle function are likely to augment the effects of immunosenescence. In this study, we test whether the effects of inadequate nutrition can be reversed by multi-nutrient supplementation, consequently enhancing vaccine responses, reducing the risk of viral infections, and improving respiratory and muscle function.","We developed a novel method for efficiently estimating time-varying selection coefficients from genome-wide ancient DNA data. In simulations, our method accurately recovers selective trajectories, and is robust to mis-specification of population size. We applied it to a large dataset of ancient and present-day human genomes from Britain, and identified seven loci with genome-wide significant evidence of selection in the past 4500 years. Almost all of them are related to increased vitamin D or calcium levels, and we conclude that lack of vitamin D and consequent low calcium was consistently the most important selective pressure in Britain since the Bronze Age. However, the strength of selection on individual loci varied substantially over time, suggesting that cultural or environmental factors moderated the genetic response to this pressure. Of 28 complex anthropometric and metabolic traits, skin pigmentation was the only one with significant evidence of polygenic selection, further underscoring the importance of phenotypes related to vitamin D. Our approach illustrates the power of ancient DNA to characterize selection in human populations and illuminates the recent evolutionary history of Britain.","  Objective: 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) deficiency has been associated with\nsleep disorders in adults. Only three cross-sectional studies were performed in\nchildren and showed an association between 25OHD deficiency and both\nobstructive sleep apnea syndrome and primary snoring. No longitudinal study has\nbeen performed in children from the general population. We analyzed the\nassociation between cord-blood vitamin D level at birth and night-sleep\nduration trajectories for children between 2 and 5-6 years old in a\nnon-clinical cohort.Method: We included 264 children from the French EDEN\nmother-child birth-cohort with both cord-blood 25OHD level determined by\nradio-immunoassay at birth, and night-sleep trajectories for children between 2\nand 5-6 years old obtained by the group-based trajectory modeling method.\nAssociations between 25OHD and sleep trajectories were assessed by multinomial\nlogistic regression adjusted for maternal and child characteristics.Results:\nThe trajectories short sleep (&lt;10h30/night), medium-low sleep\n(10h30-11h00/night), medium-high sleep ($\\approx$11h30/night), long sleep\n($\\ge$11h30/night) and changing sleep (decreased from $\\ge$11h30 to\n10h30-11h00/night) represented 5%, 46%, 37%, 4% and 8% of the children,\nrespectively. The mean 25OHD level was 19 ng/ml (SD=11, range 3 to 63). It was\n12 (SD=7), 20 (SD=11), 19 (SD=10), 14 (SD=7) and 16 (SD=8) ng/ml for children\nwith short, medium-low, medium-high, long and changing sleep trajectories,\nrespectively. On adjusted analysis, for each 1-ng/ml decrease in 25OHD level,\nthe odds of belonging to the short sleep versus medium-high sleep trajectory\nwas increased (odds ratio =1.12, 95% confidence interval [1.01-1.25]). We found\nno other significant association between 25OHD level and other\ntrajectories.Conclusion: Low 25OHD level at birth may be associated with\nincreased probability of being a persistent short sleeper in preschool years.\nThese results need confirmation.\n","Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) active cases continue to demand the development of safe and effective treatments. This is the first clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral thymic peptides.","Ciliopathies represent a disease class characterized by a broad range of phenotypes including polycystic kidneys and skeletal anomalies. Ciliopathic skeletal phenotypes are among the most common and most difficult to treat due to a poor understanding of the pathological mechanisms leading to disease. Using an avian model (talpid2) for a human ciliopathy with skeletal anomalies (Orofaciodigital syndrome 14), we identified disruptions in the FGF23-PTH axis that resulted in reduced calcium uptake in the developing mandible and subsequent micrognathia. While pharmacological intervention with the FDA-approved pan-FGFR inhibitor AZD4547 alone rescued expression of the FGF target Sprouty2, it did not significantly rescue micrognathia. In contrast, treatment with a cocktail of AZD4547 and Teriparatide acetate, a PTH agonist and FDA-approved treatment for osteoporosis, resulted in a molecular, cellular, and phenotypic rescue of ciliopathic micrognathia in talpid2 mutants. Together, these data provide novel insight into pathological molecular mechanisms associated with ciliopathic skeletal phenotypes and a potential therapeutic strategy for a pleiotropic disease class with limited to no treatment options.","To understand how the interaction between an intracellular bacterium and the host immune system contributes to outcome at the site of infection, we studied leprosy, a disease that forms a clinical spectrum, in which progressive infection by the intracellular bacterium Mycobacterium leprae is characterized by the production of type | IFNs and antibody production. We performed dual RNAseq on patient lesions, identifying a continuum of distinct bacterial states that are linked to the host immune response. The bacterial burden, represented by the fraction of bacterial transcripts, correlates with a host type | IFN gene signature, known to inhibit antimicrobial responses. Second, the bacterial transcriptional activity, defined by the bacterial mRNA/rRNA ratio, links bacterial heat shock proteins with the BAFF-BCMA host antibody response pathway. Our findings provide a platform for interrogation of host and pathogen transcriptomes at the site of infection, allowing insight into mechanisms of inflammation in human disease.","Background and Purpose Vitamin A is depleted during infections. Vitamin A has been used successfully in measles, RSV and AIDS patients and is an effective vaccine adjuvant. In this study, low retinol levels were found in patients with severe COVID-19. Retinoid signaling impairment in COVID-19 disrupts Type-I interferon synthesis.","Background Understanding the immune response to natural infection by SARS-CoV-2 is key to pandemic management, especially in the current context of emerging variants. Uncertainty remains regarding the efficacy and duration of natural immunity against reinfection.","The impact of nutrition on the metabolic profile of osteoporosis is incompletely characterized. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to detangle the association of fruit and vegetable (FV) intakes with osteoporosis prevalence. Dietary, anthropometric and blood plasma metabolite data were examined from the Boston Puerto Rican Osteoporosis Study, a cohort of 600 individuals (age 46-79yr). High FV intake was protective against osteoporosis prevalence. Associations of 525 plasma metabolites were assessed with fruit and vegetable intake, and separately with osteoporosis status. Several biological processes affiliated with the FV-associating metabolites, including caffeine metabolism, carnitines and fatty acids, and glycerophospholipids. For osteoporosis-associated metabolites, important processes were steroid hormone biosynthesis in women, and branched-chain amino acid metabolism in men. In all instances, the metabolite patterns differed greatly between sexes, arguing for a stratified nutrition approach in recommending FV intakes to improve bone health. Factors derived from principal components analysis of the FV intakes were correlated with the osteoporosis-associated metabolites, with high intake of dark leafy greens and berries/melons appearing protective in both sexes. These data warrant investigation into whether increasing intakes of dark leafy greens, berries and melons causally affect bone turnover and BMD among adults at risk for osteoporosis via sex-specific metabolic pathways, and how gene-diet interactions alter these sex-specific metabolomic-osteoporosis links.","OBJECTIVES To describe persistent symptoms and consequences in Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal diseases (RMD) discharged from the hospital after Covid-19; to assess the roll of autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ARD) compared to and non-autoimmune rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (NARD) on persistent symptoms and consequences.","Atopic dermatitis (AD) patients have been observed to have lower vitamin D levels. Previous studies have found little evidence that vitamin D levels causally influence the risk of AD, but the reverse direction has not yet been investigated.","Complex traits are influenced by genetic risk factors, lifestyle, and environmental variables, so called exposures. Some exposures, e.g., smoking or lipid levels, have common genetic modifiers identified in genome-wide association studies. Since measurements are often unfeasible, Exposure Polygenic Risk Scores (ExPRSs) offer an alternative to study the influence of exposures on various phenotypes. Here, we collected publicly available summary statistics for 28 exposures and applied four common PRS methods to generate ExPRSs in two large biobanks, the Michigan Genomics Initiative and the UK Biobank. We established ExPRS for 27 exposures and demonstrated their applicability in phenome-wide association studies and as predictors for common chronic conditions. Especially, the addition of multiple ExPRSs showed, for several chronic conditions, an improvement compared prediction models that only included traditional, disease-focused PRSs. To facilitate follow-up studies, we share all ExPRS constructs and generated results via an online repository called ExPRSweb.","Objectives Existing UK prognostic models for patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 are limited by reliance on comorbidities, which are under-recorded in secondary care, and lack of imaging data among the candidate predictors. Our aims were to develop and externally validate novel prognostic models for adverse outcomes (death, intensive therapy unit (ITU) admission) in UK secondary care; and externally validate the existing 4C score.","Objective The aim of this study was to investigate the association of food insecurity score with the status of Covid-19 infection.","Background Previous results from observational, interventional studies and in vitro experiments suggest that certain micronutrients have anti-viral and immunomodulatory activities. In particular, it has been hypothesized that zinc, selenium, copper and vitamin K1 have strong potential for prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19.","Background SARS-CoV-2 virus causes a very wide range of COVID-19 disease severity in humans: from completely asymptomatic to fatal, and the reasons behind it are often not understood. There is some data that Vitamin D may have protective effect, so authors decided to analyze European country-wide data to determine if Vitamin D levels are associated with COVID-19 population death rate.","Aberrant ocular blood vessel growth can underpin vision loss in leading causes of blindness, including neovascular age-related macular degeneration, retinopathy of prematurity and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Current pharmacological interventions require repeated invasive administrations, lack efficacy in some patients and are associated with poor patient compliance and tachyphylaxis. Small molecule vitamin D has de novo pro-differentiative, anti-proliferative, immunomodulatory, pro-apoptotic and anti-angiogenic properties. Here, our aim was to validate the anti-angiogenic activity of the biologically active form of vitamin D, calcitriol, and a selected vitamin D analogue, 22-oxacalcitriol, across a range of ocular angiogenesis models.","Background Small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (SQ-LNS) have been shown to reduce the prevalence of anemia and iron deficiency among infants and young children, but effects on other micronutrients are less well known. Identifying subgroups who may experience greater benefits from SQ-LNS, or who are more likely to respond to the intervention, may facilitate the development of public health policies and programs.","Importance Effective therapeutics for Alzheimer\u2019s disease and mild cognitive impairment are needed.","Background Studies using claims databases have reported that SARS-CoV-2 infection &gt;30 days earlier increased the incidence of type 1 diabetes (T1DM). Using exact dates of type 1 diabetes diagnosis from the national register in Scotland linked to virology laboratory data we sought to replicate this finding.","The development of new approaches that allow early assessment of which cases of COVID-19 will likely become critical and the discovery of new therapeutic targets are urgent demands. In this cohort study, we performed proteomic and laboratorial profiling of plasma from 163 patients admitted to Bauru State Hospital (Bauru, SP, Brazil) between May 4th and July 4th, 2020, who were diagnosed with COVID-19 by RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab samples. Plasma samples were collected upon admission for routine laboratory analyses and shotgun quantitative label-free proteomics. Based on the course of the disease, the patients were further divided into 3 groups: a) mild symptoms, discharged without admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) (n=76); b) severe symptoms, discharged after admission to an ICU (n=56); c) critical, died after admission to an ICU (n=31). White cells and neutrophils were significantly higher in severe and critical patients compared to mild ones. Lymphocytes were significantly lower in critical patients compared to mild ones and platelets were significantly lower in critical patients compared to mild and severe ones. Ferritin, TGO, urea and creatinine were significantly higher in critical patients compared to mild and severe ones. Albumin, CPK, LDH and D-dimer were significantly higher in severe and critical patients compared to mild ones. PCR was significantly higher in severe patients compared to mild ones. Proteomic analysis revealed marked changes between the groups in plasma proteins related to complement activation, blood coagulation, antimicrobial humoral response, acute inflammatory response, and endopeptidase inhibitor activity. Higher levels of IREB2, GELS, POLR3D, PON1 and ULBP6 upon admission to hospital were found in patients with mild symptoms, while higher levels of Gal-10 were found in critical and severe patients. This needs to be validated in further studies. If confirmed, pathways involving these proteins might be potential new therapeutic targets for COVID-19.","Recent work has found increasing evidence of mitigated, incompletely penetrant phenotypes in heterozygous carriers of recessive Mendelian disease variants. We leveraged whole-exome imputation within the full UK Biobank cohort (N\u223c500K) to extend such analyses to 3,481 rare variants curated from ClinVar and OMIM. Testing these variants for association with 57 quantitative traits yielded 103 significant associations involving variants previously implicated in 35 different diseases. Notable examples included a POR missense variant implicated in Antley-Bixler syndrome that associated with a 1.76 (s.e. 0.27) cm increase in height, and an ABCA3 missense variant implicated in interstitial lung disease that associated with reduced FEV1/FVC ratio. Association analyses with 1,257 disease traits yielded five additional variant-disease associations. We also observed contrasting levels of recessiveness between two more-common, classical Mendelian diseases. Carriers of cystic fibrosis variants exhibited increased risk of several mitigated disease phenotypes, whereas carriers of spinal muscular atrophy alleles showed no evidence of altered phenotypes. Incomplete penetrance of cystic fibrosis carrier phenotypes did not appear to be mediated by common allelic variation on the functional haplotype. Our results show that many disease-associated recessive variants can produce mitigated phenotypes in heterozygous carriers and motivate further work exploring penetrance mechanisms.","Several age predictors based on DNA methylation, dubbed epigenetic clocks, have been created in recent years, with the vast majority based on regularized linear regression. This study explores the improvement in the performance and interpretation of epigenetic clocks using deep learning. First, we gathered 143 publicly available data sets from several human tissues to develop AltumAge, a neural network framework that is a highly accurate and precise age predictor. Compared to ElasticNet, AltumAge performs better for within-data set and cross-data set age prediction, being particularly more generalizable in older ages and new tissue types. We then used deep learning interpretation methods to learn which methylation sites contributed to the final model predictions. We observe that while most important CpG sites are linearly related to age, some highly-interacting CpG sites can influence the relevance of such relationships. Using chromatin annotations, we show that the CpG sites with the highest contribution to the model predictions were related to gene regulatory regions in the genome, including proximity to CTCF binding sites. We also found age-related KEGG pathways for genes containing these CpG sites. Lastly, we perform downstream analyses of AltumAge to explore its applicability and compare its age acceleration with Horvath\u2019s model. We show that our neural network approach predicts higher age acceleration for tumors and for cells that exhibit age-related changes in vitro, such as replicative senescence and mitochondrial dysfunction. Altogether, our neural network approach provides significant improvement and flexibility to current epigenetic clocks for both performance and model interpretability.","Objective Cytokine storm and Coagulopathy have been implicated as major causes of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. A black yeast Aureobasidium pullulans AFO-202 strain produced beta 1,3-1,6 glucan has been reported to offer potential immune enhancement and metabolism balancing, as well as mitigation of coagulopathy risks. The N-163 strain produced beta glucan is an efficient anti-inflammatory immune modulator. In this pilot clinical study, we report the beneficial effects of these two beta glucans on the biomarkers for cytokine storm and coagulopathy in COVID-19 patients.","Objective Chronic periodontitis has been proposed to be linked to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on the basis of its inflammation mechanism. We aimed to evaluate this association by investigating the expression of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2) in periodontal compartments, which contain dysbiosis-associated pathogenic bacteria, and how it can be directly or indirectly involved in exacerbating inflammation in periodontal tissue.","The arrival of farming in Europe around 8,500 years ago necessitated adaptation to new environments, pathogens, diets, and social organizations. While indirect evidence of adaptation can be detected in patterns of genetic variation in present-day people, ancient DNA makes it possible to witness selection directly by analyzing samples from populations before, during and after adaptation events. Here we report the first genome-wide scan for selection using ancient DNA, capitalizing on the largest genome-wide dataset yet assembled: 230 West Eurasians dating to between 6500 and 1000 BCE, including 163 with newly reported data. The new samples include the first genome-wide data from the Anatolian Neolithic culture, who we show were members of the population that was the source of Europe\u2019s first farmers, and whose genetic material we extracted by focusing on the DNA-rich petrous bone. We identify genome-wide significant signatures of selection at loci associated with diet, pigmentation and immunity, and two independent episodes of selection on height.","Skin allo- and xenotransplantation are the standard treatment for major burns when donor sites for autografts are not available and have been shown to significantly accelerate wound healing. Although the cellular elements of foreign grafts are rejected, the extracellular matrix components integrate into the wound and may underlie their beneficial effects on wound healing. The molecular mechanisms defining the relationship between the immune response to foreign grafts and their impact on wound healing have not been fully elucidated. Here, we investigated changes in collagen architecture after xenogeneic implantation of clinically available human biologic scaffolds. We show that collagen deposition in response to the implantation of human split-thickness skin grafts (hSTSG) containing live cells recapitulates normal skin architecture, whereas human acellular dermal matrix (ADM) grafts led to highly aligned collagen deposition, characteristic of fibrosis and scar. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing, we show that macrophage differentiation in response to hSTSG is driven by vitamin D (VD) signaling toward Trem2+ subpopulations with an enrichment of pro-angiogenic and anti-fibrotic transcriptomic programs. We subsequently induced this regenerative subpopulation in vitro by treating bone marrow-derived cells with vitamin D3 and found that hydrogel delivery of Trem2+ macrophages significantly accelerated wound closure in a human-like murine excisional wound model. Our study identifies the preclinical therapeutic potential of Trem2+ macrophages to mitigate fibrosis and promote wound healing and provides a novel effective strategy to develop advanced cell therapies for complex wounds.","Background Globally 20 million children are born with a birth weight below 2,500 grams every year which is considered as a low birthweight (LBW) baby. This study investigates the contribution of modifiable risk factors to inform activities that reduce the rates of LBW in Wales.","As the current COVID-19 pandemic progresses, more symptoms and signals related to how the disease manifests in the human body arise in the literature. Skin lesions and coagulopathies may be confounding factors on routine care and patient management. We analyzed the metabolic and lipidic profile of the skin from COVID-19 patients using imprints in silica plates as a non-invasive alternative, in order to better understand the biochemical disturbances caused by SARS-CoV-2 in the skin. One hundred and one patients (64 COVID-19 positive patients and 37 control patients) were enrolled in this cross-sectional study from April 2020 to June 2020 during the first wave of COVID-19 in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. Fourteen biomarkers were identified related to COVID-19 infection (7 increased and 7 decreased in COVID-19 patients). Remarkably, oleamide has shown promising performance, providing 79.0% of sensitivity on a receiver operating characteristic curve model. Species related to coagulation and immune system maintenance such as phosphatidylserines were decreased in COVID-19 patients; on the other hand, cytokine storm and immunomodulation may be affected by molecules increased in the COVID-19 group, particularly primary fatty acid amides and N-acylethanolamines, which are part of the endocannabinoid system. Our results show that skin imprints may be a useful, noninvasive strategy for COVID-19 screening, by electing a pool of biomarkers with diagnostic potential.","Objective To assess the peripheral immune system of newly diagnosed relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients and compare it to healthy controls (HC).","Background The role of ambient temperature in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections and subsequent deaths due to COVID-19 remains contentious. Coronaviruses such as the 2003 SARS-CoV showed an increased risk of transmission during cooler days. We sought to analyse the effects of ambient temperature on SARS-COV-2 transmission and deaths related to the virus.","Congenital birth defects due to mutations of enzymes involved cholesterol synthesis, like Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) and Lathosterolosis are characterized by an accumulation of cholesterol precursors. The phenotype of both SLOS and Lathosterolosis have similarities to syndromes associated with abnormal Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling, consistent with the observation that cholesterol precursors and their derivative can inhibit Shh signaling. Two types of multipass membrane proteins play central roles in Shh signal transduction, the putative Resistance, Nodulation and Division (RND) antiporters Patched (Ptch)1 and \u22122, and the G-protein coupled receptor Smoothened (Smo). Sterols have been suggested as cargo for Ptch1/2, while Smo activity can affected both positively and negatively by steroidal molecules. We demonstrate that embryonic stem cells with mutations in the 7-dehydroxycholesterol reductase (7Dhcr) or sterol-C5-desaturase (Sc5d) gene reduce the Hh response in adjacent wildtype cells when grown in mosaic organoids. This non-cell autonomous inhibitory activity of the mutant cells requires the presence of both Ptch1 and Ptch2. These observations support a model in which late cholesterol precursors that accumulate in cells lacking 7Dhcr are the cargo for Ptch1 and Ptch2 efflux activity and mediate the non-cell autonomous inhibition of Smo.","Objectives To investigate causality of the association of serum vitamin D with the risk and severity of COVID-19 infection.","There are numerous guidelines developed for bone health. Yet it is unclear the differences in guideline development methods explain the variability in recommendations for vitamin D and calcium intakes. The objective of this systematic review was to collate and compare recommendations for vitamin D and calcium across bone health guidelines, assess methods used to form the recommendations, and explore which methodological factors were associated with these guideline recommendations. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and other databases indexing guidelines to identify records in English between 2009 and 2019. Guidelines or policy statements on bone health or osteoporosis prevention for generally healthy adults aged \u226540 years were eligible for inclusion. Two reviewers independently extracted recommendations on daily vitamin D and calcium intake, supplement use, serum 25 hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D] level, and sunlight exposure; assessed guideline development methods against 25 recommended criteria in the World Health Organization (WHO) Handbook for Guideline Development; and, identified types of evidence underpinning the recommendations. We included 47 eligible guidelines from 733 records: 74% of the guidelines provided vitamin D (200\u223c600-4000 IU/day) and 70% provided calcium (600-1200 mg/day) recommendations; 96% and 88% recommended vitamin D and calcium supplements, respectively; and 70% recommended a specific 25(OH)D concentration. The mean of meeting 25 WHO methodological criteria per guideline was 10 (95% CI: 9-12; interquartile range: 6-15). There was uncertainty in the associations between the methodological criteria and the proportion of guidelines that provided recommendations on daily vitamin D or calcium. Various types of evidence, ranging from previous bone guidelines, nutrient reference reports, systematic reviews, observational studies, to perspectives/editorials were used to underpin the recommendations. In conclusion, there is considerable variability in vitamin D and calcium recommendation and in guideline development methods in bone health guidelines. Effort is required to strengthen methodological rigor of guideline development and utilize the best available evidence to underpin public health nutrition.","Objective To evaluate the association between four iron biomarkers and sepsis.","  It is known that the primary source of dietary vitamin C is fruit and\nvegetables and the plasma level of vitamin C has been considered a good\nsurrogate biomarker of vitamin C intake by fruit and vegetable consumption. To\ncombine the information about association between vitamin C intake and the\nplasma level of vitamin C, numerical approximation methods for likelihood\nfunction of correlation coefficient are studied. The least squares approach is\nused to estimate a log-likelihood function by a function from a space of\nB-splines having desirable mathematical properties. The likelihood interval\nfrom the Highest Likelihood Regions (HLR) is used for further inference. This\napproach can be easily extended to the realm of meta-analysis involving sample\ncorrelations from different studies by use of an approximated combined\nlikelihood function. The sample correlations between vitamin C intake and serum\nlevel of vitamin C from many studies are used to illustrate application of this\napproach.\n","Although specific genes have been found to be associated with skin pigmentation, the global gene expression profile for the early stage of skin pigmentation and development in mammals is still not well understood. Here we reported a rare natural group of goat (Youzhou dark goat) featuring the dark skin of body including the visible mucous membranes, which may be an exclusive kind of large mammalian species with this special phenotype so far. In the present study, we characterized the 100-day-old fetal skin transcriptome in hyperpigmented (dark-skinned) and wild-type (white-skinned) goats using deep RNA-sequencing. A total of 923,013,870 raw reads from 6 libraries were obtained, and a large number of alternative splicing events were identified in the transcriptome of fetal skin, including the well-known melanogenic genes ASIP, TYRP1, and DCT, which were differentially expressed in the skin between the dark-skinned and white-skinned goats. Further analysis demonstrated that differential genes including ASIP, TYRP1, DCT, WNT2, RAB27A, FZD4, and CREB3L1 were significantly overrepresented in the melanogenesis pathway and several biological process associated with pigmentation. On the other hand, we identified 1616 novel transcripts in goat skin based on the characteristics of their expression level and gene composition. These novel transcripts may represent two distinct groups of nucleic acid molecules. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the characteristics of global gene expression at early stages of skin pigmentation and development, as well as describe an animal model for human diseases associated with pigmentation.","Aim Longitudinal global strain (LGS) is reduced in obese patients with normal ejection fraction of the left ventricle. TAPSE/PAPS ratio, recently described, may be a step forward a more efficient RV function evaluation.","La malnutrition, qu'il s'agisse de sous-alimentation ou de suralimentation, est courante chez les enfants ayant une deficience neurologique. Les besoins en energie sont difficiles a definir au sein de cette population heterogene. De plus, on manque d'information sur ce qui constitue la croissance normale chez ces enfants. Des facteurs non nutritionnels peuvent influer sur la croissance, mais des facteurs nutritionnels, tels qu'un apport calorique insuffisant, des pertes excessives d'elements nutritifs et un metabolisme energetique anormal, contribuent egalement au retard de croissance de ces enfants. La malnutrition est liee a une importante morbidite, tandis que la readaptation nutritionnelle ameliore l'etat de sante global. Le soutien nutritionnel doit faire partie integrante de la prise en charge des enfants ayant une deficience nutritionnelle et viser non seulement a ameliorer l'etat nutritionnel, mais egalement la qualite de vie des patients et de leur famille. Au moment d'envisager une intervention nutritionnelle, il faut tenir compte du dysfonctionnement oromoteur, du reflux gastro-oesophagien et de l'aspiration pulmonaire, et une equipe multidisciplinaire doit se concerter. Il faut reperer rapidement les enfants vulnerables a des troubles nutritionnels et proceder a une evaluation de leur etat nutritionnel au moins une fois par annee, et plus souvent chez les nourrissons et les jeunes enfants ou chez les enfants qui risquent de souffrir de malnutrition. Il faut optimiser l'apport oral s'il est securitaire, mais entreprendre une alimentation enterale chez les enfants ayant un dysfonctionnement oromoteur qui provoque une aspiration marquee ou chez ceux qui sont incapables de maintenir un etat nutritionnel suffisant au moyen de l'apport oral. Il faut reserver l'alimentation par sonde nasogastrique aux interventions a court terme, mais si une intervention nutritionnelle prolongee s'impose, il faut envisager la gastrostomie. Il faut reserver les mesures antireflux aux enfants presentant un reflux gastro-oesophagien considerable. Il faut surveiller etroitement la reponse du patient a l'intervention nutritionnelle afin d'eviter une prise de poids excessive apres l'amorce de l'alimentation enterale, et privilegier les preparations pediatriques afin d'eviter les carences en micronutriments.","Abstract Book of the 33deg Congresso Nazionale SIGOT - Bologna, 5-7 giugno 2019.","Vitamin D is an important hormonal molecule, which exerts genomic and non-genomic actions in maintaining brain development and adult brain health. Many epidemiological studies have associated vitamin D deficiency with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). Nevertheless, the underlying signaling pathway through which this occurs remains to be characterized. We were intrigued to find that although vitamin D levels are significantly low in AD patients, their hippocampal vitamin D receptor (VDR) levels are inversely increased in the cytosol of the brain cells, and colocalized with A\u03b242 plaques, gliosis and autophagosomes, suggesting that a non-genomic form of VDR is implicated in AD. Mechanistically, A\u03b242 induces the conversion of nuclear heterodimer of VDR/RXR heterodimer into a cytoplasmic VDR/p53 heterodimer. The cytosolic VDR/p53 complex mediates the A\u03b242\u2013induced autophagic apoptosis. Reduction of p53 activity in AD mice reverses the VDR/RXR formation and rescues AD brain pathologies and cognitive impairment. In line with the impaired genomic VDR pathway, the transgenic AD mice fed a vitamin D sufficient diet exhibit lower plasma vitamin D levels since early disease phases, raising the possibility that vitamin D deficiency may actually be an early manifestation of AD. Despite the deficiency of vitamin D in AD mice, vitamin D supplementation not only has no benefit but lead to exacerbated A\u03b242 depositions and cognitive impairment. Together, these data indicate that the impaired genomic vitamin D pathway links A\u03b242 to induce autophagic apoptosis, and suggest that VDR/p53 pathway could be targeted for the treatment of AD.","Vitamin-D receptor (VDR) mRNA is enriched in malignant lung, ovarian and pancreatic tissues and showed poor prognoses. Calcitriol and stable or CRISPR-directed VDR upregulation increased PD-L1mRNA and protein expression in cancer cells in-vitro. A ChIP assay showed the binding of VDR with VDREPD-L1. Stattic, a STAT3 phosphorylation inhibitor blocked calcitriol or VDR overexpression induced PD-L1 upregulation. MeTC7, a VDR antagonist developed by us, reduced PD-L1 expression on macrophages, ovarian, lung, breast, and pancreatic cancer cells in-vitro. In radiotherapy inducible PD-L1 model of orthotopic MC38 murine colon cancer, MeTC7 decreased PD-L1 surface expression, suppressed inflammatory monocytes (IMs) population and increased intra-tumoral CD69+PD1+CD8+T-cells. Intriguingly, MeTC7 reduced TH-MYCN transgenic neuroblastoma tumor growth without affecting PD-L1 and tumor immune milieu. In summary, Vitamin-D/VDR drives PD-L1 expression on cancer cells via STAT-3. Inhibiting VDR exhibited anti-checkpoint effects in orthotopic colon tumors, whereas PDL1-independent and anti-VDR/MYCN effects controlled growth of transgenic neuroblastoma and xenografted tumors.","Background As mother-to-child-transmission of HIV decreases, and the population of infants who are born HIV-exposed, but uninfected (HEU) continues to rise, there is growing need to understand the development and health outcomes of infants who are HEU to ensure that they have the healthiest start to life.","Humic substances are well known human nutritional supplement materials and play important performance-enhancing roles as animal feed additives, too. For decades, ingredients of humic substances have also been proven to carry potent antiviral effects against different viruses. Here, the antiviral activity of a humic substance containing ascorbic acid, Se- and Zn2+ ions intended as a nutritional supplement material was investigated against SARS-CoV-2 virus B1.1.7 Variant of Concern (\u201cAlpha Variant\u201d) in a VeroE6 cell line. Results show that this combination has a significant in vitro antiviral effect at a very low concentration range of its intended active ingredients. Even picomolar concentration ranges of humic substances, vitamin C and Zn/Se ions in the given composition were enough to achieve fifty percent viral replication inhibition in the applied SARS-CoV-2 virus inhibition test.","Objective To estimate the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in Eastern part of Nepal and identify the sociodemographic factors associated with it.","Background and study aim COVID-19 mortality, severity, and recovery are major global concerns, but they are still insufficiently understood, particularly in the Middle East. This study focused on evaluating if there was a link between COVID-19 patients\u2019 clinical and laboratory findings at hospital admission and disease severity and mortality.","Importance Patients with COVID-19 may exhibit 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency, but the beneficial effects of vitamin D3 supplementation in this disease remain to be proven by randomized controlled trials.","Background While there was a lack of pharmacological interventions proven to be effective in early, outpatient settings for COVID-19, in a prospective, open-label observational study (pre-AndroCoV Trial) the use of nitazoxanide, ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine demonstrated similar effects, and apparent improvement of outcomes compared to untreated patients. The unexpected apparent positive results led to ethical questions on the employment of further full placebo-control studies in early stage COVID-19. The objective of the present study was to elucidate whether the conduction of a full placebo-control RCT was still ethically viable, through a comparative analysis with two control-groups.","  Diet design for vegetarian health is challenging due to the limited food\nrepertoire of vegetarians. This challenge can be partially overcome by\nquantitative, data-driven approaches that utilise massive nutritional\ninformation collected for many different foods. Based on large-scale data of\nfoods' nutrient compositions, the recent concept of nutritional fitness helps\nquantify a nutrient balance within each food with regard to satisfying daily\nnutritional requirements. Nutritional fitness offers prioritisation of\nrecommended foods using the foods' occurrence in nutritionally adequate food\ncombinations. Here, we systematically identify nutritionally recommendable\nfoods for semi- to strict vegetarian diets through the computation of\nnutritional fitness. Along with commonly recommendable foods across different\ndiets, our analysis reveals favourable foods specific to each diet, such as\nimmature lima beans for a vegan diet as an amino acid and choline source, and\nmushrooms for ovo-lacto vegetarian and vegan diets as a vitamin D source.\nFurthermore, we find that selenium and other essential micronutrients can be\nsubject to deficiency in plant-based diets, and suggest nutritionally-desirable\ndietary patterns. We extend our analysis to two hypothetical scenarios of\nhighly personalised, plant-based methionine-restricted diets. Our\nnutrient-profiling approach may provide a useful guide for designing different\ntypes of personalised vegetarian diets.\n","Insights from extreme-adapted organisms, which have evolved natural strategies for promoting survivability under severe environmental pressures, may help guide future research into novel approaches for enhancing human longevity. The cave-adapted Mexican tetra,Astyanax mexicanus, has attracted interest as a model system for metabolic resilience, a term we use to denote the property of maintaining robust health and longevity under conditions that would have highly deleterious effects in other organisms (Fig 1). Cave-dwelling populations of Mexi-can tetra exhibit elevated blood glucose and possess a mutation in the insulin receptor that in humans has been linked to Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome, a condition characterized by severe insulin resistance that causes numerous developmental abnormalities, is highly associated with debilitating progression, and drastically reduces lifespan. In addition, cavefish develop large numbers of hypertrophic visceral adipocytes and possess vastly enriched stores of body fat compared to surface-dwelling counterparts. However, cavefish appear to avoid the progression of the respective pathologies typically associated with these conditions, such as accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), chronic tissue inflammation, impaired growth due to insulin dysregulation, and low survivability due to arterial disease. The metabolic strategies underlying the resilience properties of A. mexicanus cavefish, and how they relate to environmental challenges of the cave environment, are poorly understood. Here, we provide an untargeted metabolomics study of long- and short-term fasting in two A. mexicanus cave populations and one surface population. We find that, although cave-fish share many similarities with metabolic syndrome normally associated with the human state of obesity, important differences emerge, including a reduction in cholesteryl esters and intermediates of protein glycation, and an increase in antioxidants and metabolites associated with hypoxia and longevity. We find important overlaps between metabolic alterations in cave-dwelling Mexican tetra and other models of resilience and extreme longevity, such as naked mole-rats, including enhanced reliance on sugars as an energy source and a trend toward more potent antioxidant activity. This work suggests that certain metabolic features associated with human pathologies are not intrinsically harmful, but are rather consequences of suboptimal adaptation of humans to survival under adverse metabolic conditions, and suggests promising avenues for future investigation into the role of metabolic strategies in evolutionary adaptation and health. We provide a transparent pipeline for reproducing our analysis and a Shiny app for other researchers to explore and visualize our dataset.","Background Evidence recommends that vitamin D might be a crucial supportive agent for the immune system, mainly in cytokine response regulation against COVID-19. Hence, we carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis in order to maximize the use of everything that exists about the role of vitamin D in the COVID-19.","Background Risk for several common cancers is influenced by the transcriptomic landscape of the respective tissue-of-origin. Vitamin D influences in-vitro gene expression and cancer cell growth. We sought to determine whether oral vitamin D induces beneficial gene expression effects in human rectal epithelium and identify biomarkers of response.","Testicular microcalcifications consist of hydroxyapatite and their demonstration by ultrasound has been associated with increased risk of testicular germ cell cancer (TGCT). Here, we show that fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a bone-specific regulator of phosphate homeostasis, is expressed in testicular germ cell neoplasia in situ (GCNIS), embryonal carcinoma (EC), and human embryonic stem cells. FGF23 is not glycosylated in TGCTs and thus rapidly cleaved into a C-terminal fragment that serves as a competitive antagonist for full-length FGF23. High levels of C-terminal FGF23 occupy the receptor formed by Klotho and FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1) in the germ cells facilitating a shift in the expression of phosphate transport proteins from SLC34A2 to SLC34A1 in seminiferous tubules adjacent to GCNIS. Fgf23 knockout mice have a marked epididymal deposition of hydroxyapatite, while the testicular phenotype is milder with spermatogenic arrest and focal germ-cell-specific expression of the bone-like markers runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) and bone gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-containing protein (BGLAP). In accordance, mice with no functional androgen receptor and lack of circulating gonadotropins develop microcalcifications in 94% of cases and have lower Slc34a2, and higher Slc34a1 and Bglap expression. In accordance, human testicular specimens with microcalcifications also have lower SLC34A2, and focally germ cells express SLC34A1, BGLAP, and RUNX2. Importantly, calcium or phosphate induced osteogenic transdifferentiation of a spermatogonial cell line in vitro demonstrated by induction of alkaline phosphatase activity and deposition of hydroxyapatite, which could be fully rescued by pyrophosphate (PPi). Severe microcalcifications were also found in a mouse model with Sertoli-cell ablation particularly when Sertoli-ablation was conducted prepubertally where the germ cells retain stem cell potential. In conclusion, cancer-related microcalcifications may arise secondary to gonadal mineral alterations, which in combination with impaired Sertoli cell function and reduced PPi due to high alkaline phosphatase activity in GCNIS and TGCTs, facilitates osteogenic transdifferentiation of testicular germ cells and deposition of hydroxyapatite.","The capacity to generate functional hepatocytes from renewable human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) could address limited supplies of primary human hepatocytes. However, hepatocytes differentiated from hPSCs in vitro are functionally immature. To understand mechanisms regulating maturation of in vitro derived hepatocytes, we developed a 3D spheroid differentiation system and compared gene regulatory elements in uncultured human primary hepatocytes with those in hepatocytes that were differentiated in 2D or 3D conditions from human PSCs by RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and H3K27Ac ChIP-seq. Three-dimensional differentiation improved enhancer activity and expression of transcription factor ONECUT1, but was insufficient to upregulate human-specific mature hepatocytes marker gene CYP3A4 or super-enhancer regulated transcription factor gene NFIC. Regulome comparisons showed reduced enrichment of thyroid receptor THRB motifs in accessible chromatin and in active enhancers without reduced transcription of THRB, suggesting the regulation at the level of THRB ligands in PSC-differentiated hepatocytes. Addition of thyroid hormone T3 to the PSC-differentiated hepatocytes increased CYP3A4 expression. T3 increased binding of THRB to the CYP3A4 proximal enhancer and restored the super-enhancer status and gene expression of NFIC and reduced expression of AFP. The resultant hPSC-hepatocytes showed gene expression, epigenetic status and super-enhancer landscape closer to primary hepatocytes and activated regulatory regions including non-coding SNPs associated with liver-related diseases. Transplanting the 3D PSC-hepatocytes into immunocompromised mice resulted in engraftment of human hepatocytes in the mouse liver parenchyma without disrupting normal liver histology at 6 months after transplantation. This work provides insights into the functions of nuclear receptor THRB and highlights the importance of the environmental factors-nuclear receptors axis in regulating maturation of human PSC-differentiated cell types.","We have undertaken an extensive Mendelian randomization (MR) study using methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) as genetic instruments to assess the potential causal relationship between genetic variation, DNA methylation and 139 complex traits. Using two-sample MR, we observed 1,191 effects across 62 traits where genetic variants were associated with both proximal DNA methylation (i.e. cis-mQTL) and complex trait variation (P&lt;1.39x10\u221208). Joint likelihood mapping provided evidence that the causal mQTL for 364 of these effects across 58 traits was also likely the causal variant for trait variation. These effects showed a high rate of replication in the UK Biobank dataset for 14 selected traits, as 121 of the attempted 129 effects replicated. Integrating expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data suggested that genetic variants responsible for 319 of the 364 mQTL effects also influence gene expression, which indicates a coordinated system of effects that are consistent with causality. CpG sites were enriched for histone mark peaks in tissue types relevant to their associated trait and implicated genes were enriched across relevant biological pathways. Though we are unable to distinguish mediation from horizontal pleiotropy in these analyses, our findings should prove valuable in identifying candidate loci for further evaluation and help develop mechanistic insight into the aetiology of complex disease.","AIM To investigate the associations of meteorological factors and the daily new cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in nine Asian cities.","NWD1, a mouse purified western diet uniquely relevant to human nutritional exposures elevating risk for human sporadic colon cancer rapidly and reversibly altered the stem cell signature and transcriptome of Lgr5hi intestinal stem cells. Down-regulated Ppargc1a expression altered mitochondrial structure and function, metabolically reprogramming Lgr5hi cells, suppressing developmental maturation of their progeny as they progress through progenitor cell compartments. This recruited Bmi1+, Ascl2 cells, remodeling the mucosa, including cell adaptation to the altered nutritional environment and elevated pathways of antigen processing and presentation, especially in mature enterocytes, a pathogenic mechanism in human Inflammatory Bowel Disease resulting in chronic low-level pro-tumorigenic inflammation. Plasticity of intestinal cells to function as stem-like cells encompasses a physiological and continual response to changing nutritional environments, supporting historic concepts of tissue homeostasis as a process of continual adaptation to the environment, with important consequences for mechanisms establishing probability for tumor development. The data emphasize importance of better reflecting human nutritional exposures in mouse models of development and disease.","The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted communities far and wide and put tremendous pressure on healthcare systems of countries across the globe. Understanding and monitoring the major influences on COVID-19 prevalence is essential to inform policy making and device appropriate packages of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs).","Background: Epistasis and gene-environment interactions are known to contribute significantly to variation of complex phenotypes in model organisms. However, their identification in human association studies remains challenging for myriad reasons. In the case of epistatic interactions, the large number of potential interacting sets of genes presents computational, multiple hypothesis correction, and other statistical power issues. In the case of gene-environment interactions, the lack of consistently measured environmental covariates in most disease studies precludes searching for interactions and creates difficulties for replicating studies.","In this study, we summarize the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 outbreak among Healthcare workers (HCWs) in a tertiary care hospital and compared various parameters and preventive measures taken by positive HCWs to a comparable cohort of COVID negative HCWs. 52.1% of COVID-19 positive HCWs showed symptoms of which only three needed hospitalization possibly due to a younger cohort of HCWs who got infected (35.9 \u00b1 9.3 years). Findings of present study found some protective role of full course prophylactic hydroxychloroquine as compared to a control group (p=0.021) and use of N95 masks over others (p&lt;0.001). Our results did not show any added protection with the use of prophylactic Vitamin C, D, Zinc, or betadine gargles. We also observed outbreak control with increased awareness, near universal testing, PPE provision, sanitization drive, and promoting social distancing among HCWs.","We systematically investigated an ongoing debate about the possible correlation between SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) epidemiological outcomes and solar exposure in European countries, in the period of March \u2013 August 2020. For each country, we correlated its mortality data with solar insolation (watt/square metre) and objective sky cloudiness (as cloud fraction) derived from satellite weather data. We found a positive correlation between the monthly mortality rate and the overall cloudiness in that month (Pearson\u2019s r(35)=.779, P&lt;.001; linear model fitting the data, adjusted R2 =0.59). In Europe, in colder months, approximately 34% to 58% of the variance in COVID-19 mortality/million appears to be predicted by the cloudiness fraction of the sky, except in August in which only \u223c15% of the variance was explained. The data show a low, negative correlation between the mortality rate with the overall insolation received by the country area in that entire month (Pearson\u2019s r(35)=-0.622, P&lt;.001). Additionally, we did not find any statistically significant correlation between the mortality and the latitude of the countries when the \u201clatitude of a country\u201d was precisely defined as the average landmass location (country centroid). The unexpected correlation found between cloudiness and mortality could perhaps be explained by the following: 1) heavy cloudiness is linked with colder outdoor surfaces, which might aid virus survival; 2) reduced evaporation rate; 3) moderate pollution may be linked to both cloudiness and mortality; and 4) large-scale behavioural changes due to cloudiness (which perhaps drives people to spend more time indoors and thus facilitates indoor contamination).","The COVID-19 outbreak shows a huge variation in prevalence and mortality on geographical level but also within populations1. The ACE2 gene, identified as the SARS-CoV2 receptor, has been shown to facilitate the viral invasion and people with higher ACE2 expression generally are more severely affected2, 3. As there is a lot of variability in ACE2 expression between individuals we hypothesized that differential DNA methylation profiles could be (one of) the confounding factors explaining this variability. Here we show that epigenetic profiling of host tissue, especially in the ACE2 promoter region and its homologue ACE1, may be important risk factors for COVID-19. Our results propose that variable methylation can explain (part of) the differential susceptibility, symptom severity and death rate for COVID-19. Our findings are a promising starting point to further evaluate the potential of ACE1/2 methylation and other candidates as a predictor for clinical outcome upon SARS-CoV2 infection.","Oestrogens and 1a,25(OH)2-vitamin D3 (1,25-D3) are steroids that can provide effects by binding to their receptors localised in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus or the plasma membrane respectively inducing genomic and non-genomic effects. As confirmed notably by invalidation of the genes, coding for their receptors as tested with mice with in vivo and in vitro treatments, oestrogens and 1,25-D3 are regulators of spermatogenesis. Moreover, some functions of ejaculated spermatozoa as viability, DNA integrity, motility, capacitation, acrosome reaction and fertilizing ability are targets for these hormones. The studies conducted on their mechanisms of action, even though not completely elicited, have allowed the demonstration of putative interactions between their signalling pathways that are worth examining more closely. The present review focuses on the elements regulated by oestrogens and 1,25-D3 in the testis and spermatozoa as well as the interactions between the signalling pathways of both hormones.","We aimed to investigate the link between serum metabolites, gut bacterial community composition, and clinical variables in Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) and healthy control subjects (HC). 139 metabolite features were found to be differentially abundant between the PD and Control groups. No associations were found between metabolite features and within-PD clinical variables. The results suggest alterations in serum metabolite profiles in PD, and the results of correlation analysis between metabolite features and microbiota suggest that several bacterial taxa are associated with altered lipid and energy metabolism in PD.","Alzheimer\u2019s disease is characterized by the presence in the brain of amyloid plaques formed by the aberrant deposition of the amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2). Since many vitamins are dysregulated in this disease, we explored whether these molecules participate in protein homeostasis by modulating A\u03b2 aggregation. By screening 18 fat-soluble and water-soluble vitamins, we found that retinoic acid and \u03b1-tocopherol, two metabolites of vitamin A and vitamin E, respectively, affect A\u03b2 aggregation both in vitro and in a C. elegans model of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. We also show that effects of these two vitamin metabolites in combination can cancel each other out, suggesting that the complex composition of the cellular environment could have a protective role against protein aggregation through the simultaneous presence of aggregation promoters and inhibitors. Taken together, these results indicate that vitamins and their metabolites may be added to the list of components of the quality control system that regulate protein aggregation.","Background Humans take vitamin D supplements to reduce risk of vitamin D deficiency and reduce the risk of osteoporosis. However, it is unclear how dietary super-doses (10,000x greater than requirement) can affect vitamin D status in aged animals. Aged laying hens could be a model to compare with women in peri- or postmenopausal stages of life. The hens\u2019 bone health is physiologically taxed from egg production and they are highly susceptible to osteoporosis.","DNA methylation age acceleration (DNAmAA, derived from an epigenetic clock) and relative leukocyte telomere length (rLTL) are widely accepted biomarkers of aging. Nevertheless, it is still unclear which aspects of aging they represent best. Here we evaluated longitudinal associations between baseline rLTL and DNAmAA (estimated with 7-CpG clock) and functional assessments covering different domains of aging. Additionally, we made use of cross-sectional data on these assessments and examined their association with DNAmAA estimated by five different DNAm age measures.","Background Stratifying the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) based on polygenic risk scores (PRSs) within populations has the potential to optimize screening and develop targeted prevention strategies.","Background COVID-19 has emerged as a global pandemic, affecting nearly 104 million people worldwide as of February 4th 2021. In previous published studies, the association between the mean Vit D status of each country and COVID-19 infection rate, and mortality among the adult population in European countries was examined. The aim of this study was to re-examine the relationship between the Vit D status of each country and COVID-19 infection, recovery, and mortality using updated data and a different methodological approach.","The haplotypes of a beneficial allele carry information about its history that can shed light on its age and putative cause for its increase in frequency. Specifically, the signature of an allele\u2019s age is contained in the pattern of local ancestry that mutation and recombination impose on its haplotypic background. We provide a method to exploit this pattern and infer the time to the common ancestor of a positively selected allele following a rapid increase in frequency. We do so using a hidden Markov model which leverages the length distribution of the shared ancestral haplotype, the accumulation of derived mutations on the ancestral background, and the surrounding background haplotype diversity. Using simulations, we demonstrate how the inclusion of information from both mutation and recombination events increases accuracy relative to approaches that only consider a single type of event. We also show the behavior of the estimator in cases where data do not conform to model assumptions, and provide some diagnostics for assessing and improving inference. Using the method, we analyze population-specific patterns in the 1000 Genomes Project data to provide a global perspective on the timing of adaptation for several variants which show evidence of recent selection and functional relevance to diet, skin pigmentation, and morphology in humans.","Background Many studies were carried out to investigate the relationship between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene with obesity. However, little is known about the role of VDR gene polymorphism with obesity in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Therefore, we aimed to investigate VDR gene TaqI, ApaI and FokI SNPs in overweight/obese HD patients.","Less than 11% of pancreatic cancer patients survive 5-years post-diagnosis. The unique biology of pancreatic cancer includes a significant expansion of its desmoplastic tumor microenvironment, wherein cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and their self-produced extracellular matrix are key components. CAF functions are both tumor-supportive and tumor-suppressive, while normal fibroblastic cells are solely tumor-suppressive. Knowing that CAF-eliminating drugs are ineffective and can accelerate cancer progression, therapies that \u201cnormalize\u201d CAF function are highly pursued. Eribulin is a well-tolerated anti-microtubule drug used to treat a plethora of neoplasias, including advanced/metastatic cancers. Importantly, eribulin can inhibit epithelial to mesenchymal transition via a mechanism akin to blocking pathways induced by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF\u03b2). Notably, canonical TGF\u03b2 signaling also plays a pivotal role in CAF activation, which is necessary for the development and maintenance of desmoplasia. Hence, we hypothesized that eribulin could modulate, and perhaps \u201cnormalize\u201d CAF function. To test this premise, we used a well-established in vivo-mimetic fibroblastic cell-derived extracellular matrix (CDM) system and gauged the effects of eribulin on human pancreatic CAFs and cancer cells. The pathophysiologic cell-culturing system was also used to query eribulin effects on CDM-regulated cancer cell survival and invasive spread. Results demonstrated that intact CDMs modestly restricted eribulin from obstructing cancer cell growth. Nonetheless, eribulin-treated CAFs generated CDMs that limited cancer cell survival under nutritional stress, similar to reported tumor-suppressive CDMs generated by TGF\u03b2-deficient CAFs. Data from this study support the central proposed premise and suggest that eribulin could be used as a CAF-normalizing drug.","Background We recently showed that seasonal patterns of COVID-19 incidence and Influenza-Like Illnesses incidence are highly similar, in a country in the temperate climate zone, such as the Netherlands (latitude: 52\u00b0N). We hypothesize that in The Netherlands the same environmental factors and mobility trends that are associated with the seasonality of flu-like illnesses are predictors of COVID-19 seasonality as well.","Background Several studies have suggested the positive impact of vitamin D on patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. This systematic review aims to evaluate the effects of vitamin D supplementation on clinical outcomes and mortality rate of COVID-19 patients.","Obesity is the leading proportional cause for diabetes, heart disease and cancer. Obesity occurs because the body stores surplus calories as fat. Fat cells secrete a hormone, leptin, that modulates energy balance at the brain. Changes in fat mass are mirrored by changes in serum leptin. Increases in leptin cause the brain to decrease appetite and increase energy expenditure. However in obesity, leptin sensitivity is decreased which mutes leptin mediated changes in appetite and energy expenditure. We have limited understanding of what controls leptin production by fat or how sensitive the brain is to leptin. Muscle produces a hormone, myostatin, that plays an analogous role to the role that leptin plays in fat. Absent myostatin leads to increased muscle mass and strength. We also do not know what controls myostatin production or sensitivity. Although fat mass and muscle mass are closely linked, the interplay between leptin and myostatin remains unexplored. Vitamin D improves lean mass via what are thought to be primarily trophic effects at the muscle. Here we show that high dose dietary vitamin D preferentially allocates excess calories to muscle and growth instead of storage as fat by decreasing myostatin production and increasing leptin production and sensitivity. That is, high dose vitamin D improves organismal energy sensing. Obesity, aging and other chronic inflammatory diseases are associated with decreased muscle function and mass. Our work provides a physiologic framework for how high-dose vitamin D would be effective in these pathologies to increase allocation of calories to muscle instead of fat and reveals novel interplay between the myostatin and leptin signaling whereby myostatin conveys energy needs to modulate leptin effects on calorie allocation.  Furthermore, our work reveals how physiologic seasonal variation in vitamin D may be important in controlling season-specific metabolism and calorie allocation to fat in winter and muscle in summer.","Background We conducted this systematic review to identify factors associated with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) susceptibility and outcomes among people with multiple sclerosis (MS).","Optimizing patient care based on precision oncology will inevitably become the standard of care. If we accept the principle that every persons\u2019 cancer is different then the most effective therapies will have to be designed for the individual patient and for their tumors genetic profile. Access to tumor mutational profiling is now widely available but continues to be limited by cost and actionable information. For example, novel combinations of approved drugs are rarely considered. These considerations lead us to hypothesize that artificially induced Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD) derived lung organoids could provide a novel, alternate approach for LUAD disease modeling and large-scale targeted drug screening.","Most cases of breast cancer (BC) are estrogen receptor \u03b1-positive (ER\u03b1+) at diagnosis. The presence of ER\u03b1 drives the therapeutic approach for this disease, which often consists of endocrine therapy (ET). 4OH-Tamoxifen and faslodex (i.e., fulvestrant - ICI182,780) are two ETs that render tumor cells insensitive to 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2)-dependent proliferative stimuli and prevent BC progression. However, ET has limitations and serious failures in different tissues and organs. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify novel drugs to fight BC in the clinic. Re-positioning of old drugs for new clinical purposes is an attractive alternative for drug discovery. For this analysis, we focused on the modulation of intracellular ER\u03b1 levels in BC cells as target for the screening of about 900 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved compounds that would hinder E2:ER\u03b1 signaling and inhibit BC cell proliferation. We found that carfilzomib induces ER\u03b1 degradation and prevents E2 signaling and cell proliferation in two ER\u03b1+ BC cell lines. Remarkably, the analysis of carfilzomib effects on a cell model system with an acquired resistance to 4OH-tamoxifen revealed that this drug has an antiproliferative effect superior to faslodex in BC cells. Therefore, our results identify carfilzomib as a drug preventing E2:ER\u03b1 signaling and cell proliferation in BC cells and suggest its possible re-position for the treatment of ER\u03b1+ BC as well as for those diseases that have acquired resistance to 4OH-tamoxifen.","Background South Asian countries including Bangladesh have been struggling to control the COVID-19 pandemic despite imposing months of lockdown and other public health measures (as of June 30, 2020). In-depth epidemiological information from these countries is lacking. From the perspective of Bangladesh, this study aims to understand the epidemiological features and gaps in public health preparedness.","Mitochondria contain their own genome which encodes 13 essential mitochondrial proteins and accumulates somatic variants at up to 10 times the rate of the nuclear genome. These mitochondrial genome variants lead to respiratory chain deficiency and cellular dysfunction. Work with the PolgAmut/PolgAmut mouse model, which has a high mitochondrial DNA mutation rate, showed enhanced levels of age related osteoporosis in affected mice along with respiratory chain deficiency in osteoblasts. To explore whether respiratory chain deficiency is also seen in human osteoblasts with age, we developed a protocol and analysis framework for imaging mass cytometry (IMC) in bone tissue sections to analyse osteoblasts in situ. We have demonstrated significant increases in complex I deficiency with age in human osteoblasts. This work is consistent with findings from the PolgAmut/PolgAmut mouse model and suggests that respiratory chain deficiency, as a consequence of the accumulation of age related mitochondrial DNA mutations, may have a significant role to play in the pathogenesis of human age related osteoporosis.","Background Recent meta-analyses concluded that vitamin D supplementation can prevent acute respiratory infection (ARI). However, the findings were heavily influenced by results from two arms of a six-arm cluster-randomised trial that were analysed without accounting for the cluster trial design. We have used publicly available data to provide results from the remaining four unpublished trial arms and to reanalyse the meta-analyses, accounting for the cluster trial design.","Background Evidence supporting the role of vitamin D in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic remains controversial.","Why people age at different rates is a fundamental unsolved problem in biology. We created a model that predicts an individual\u2019s age, taking as input physiological traits that change with age in the large UK Biobank dataset, such as blood pressure, blood metabolites, strength, and stimulus-reaction time. The model\u2019s Root Mean Square Error of age prediction (RMSE) is less than 5 years. We argue that the difference between calculated \u201cbiological\u201d age and actual age (\u0394Age) reflects an individual\u2019s relative youthfulness and possibly their rate of aging. Validating this interpretation, people predicted to be physiologically young for their age have a lower subsequent mortality rate and a higher parental age at death, even though no mortality data were used to calculate \u0394Age. A Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) of \u0394Age, and analysis of environmental factors associated with \u0394Age identified known as well as new factors that may influence human aging, including genes involved in synapse biology and a tendency to play computer games. We identify 12 readily-measured physiological traits that together assess a person\u2019s biological age and may be used clinically to evaluate therapeutics designed to slow aging and extend healthy life.","Background To be universally applicable in treatment of severe COVID-19, novel therapies, especially those with little toxicity and low cost, are urgently needed. We report here the use of one such therapeutic combination involving two commonly used nutraceuticals, namely resveratrol and copper in patients with this disease. This study was prompted by pre-clinical reports that sepsis-related cytokine storm and fatality in mice can be prevented by oral administration of small quantities of resveratrol and copper. Since cytokine storm and sepsis are major causes of death in severe COVID-19, we retrospectively analyzed outcomes of patients with this condition who had received resveratrol and copper.","Objective Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the pathogen accountable for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Viral entry via binding of the receptor binding domain (RBD) located within the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein to its target receptor angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is a key step in cell infection. The efficient transition of the virus is linked to a unique protein called open reading frame (ORF) 8. As SARS-CoV-2 infections can develop into life-threatening lower respiratory syndromes, effective therapy options are urgently needed. Several publications propose vitamin D treatment, although its mode of action against COVID-19 is not fully elucidated. It is speculated that vitamin D\u2019s beneficial effects are mediated by up-regulating LL-37, a well-known antimicrobial peptide with antiviral effects.","Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive disease characterized by increased levels of desmoplasia that contributes to reduced drug delivery and poor treatment outcomes. In PDAC, the stromal content can account for up to 90% of the total tumor volume. The complex interplay between stromal components, including pancreatic cancer associated fibroblasts (PCAFs), and PDAC cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) have a significant impact on prognoses and thus needs to be recapitulated in vitro when evaluating various treatment strategies. This study is a systematic evaluation of photodynamic therapy (PDT) in 3D heterotypic coculture models of PDAC with varying ratios of patient derived PCAFs that simulate heterogenous PDAC tumors with increasing stromal content. The efficacy of antibody-targeted PDT (photoimmunotherapy; PIT) using cetuximab photoimmunoconjugates (PICs) of benzoporphyrin derivative (BPD) is contrasted with that of liposomal BPD (Visudyne\u00ae), which is currently in PDT clinical trials for PDAC. We demonstrate that both Visudyne\u00ae-PDT and PIT were effective in heterotypic PDAC 3D spheroids with a low stromal content. However, as the stromal content increases above 50% in the 3D spheroids, the efficacy of Visudyne\u00ae-PDT is reduced by up to 10-fold, while PIT retains its efficacy. PIT was found to be 10-fold, 19-fold and 14-fold more phototoxic in spheroids with 50%, 75% and 90% PCAFs, respectively, as compared to Visudyne\u00ae-PDT. This marked difference in efficacy is attributed to the ability of PICs to penetrate and distribute within spheroids with a higher stromal content, whereas Visudyne\u00ae is restricted to the spheroid periphery. This study thus demonstrates how the stromal content in PDAC spheroids directly impacts their responsiveness to PDT and proposes PIT to be a highly suited treatment option for desmoplastic tumors with particularly high degrees of stromal content.","Background A 2017 meta-analysis of data from 25 randomised controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation for the prevention of acute respiratory infections revealed a protective effect of the intervention. Since then, 20 new RCTs have been completed.","Background Human urine is now recognised as a non-invasive source of stem cells with regeneration potential. These cells are mesenchymal stem cells but their detailed molecular and cellular identities are poorly defined. Furthermore, unlike the mouse, the gene regulatory network driving self-renewal and differentiation into functional renal cells in vitro remain unresolved.","Introduction Vitamin D supplements are recommended for elderly care home residents with little sunlight exposure. However, their use in care homes is limited and vitamin D deficiency in residents is widespread. This study aimed to understand perceived responsibility for the vitamin D status of residents and the determinants of current practice around supplementation.","The vitamin A metabolite all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA; tretinoin) has anticancer potential; however, lack of clinical success has prevented its approval for solid tumors. Herein, we propose combining low-dose ATRA preconditioning with fimaporfin-based photodynamic therapy (ATRA+PDT) for the treatment of solid cancers. Compared to monotherapies, ATRA+PDT induced synergistic cytotoxic responses including promotion of apoptosis in colon and breast carcinoma cell lines. In human HT-29 colon cancer cells, the effect of ATRA+PDT on gene expression was evaluated by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). The unfolded protein response (UPR) and retinoic acid-mediated apoptosis signaling were predicted as strongly activated canonical pathways after ATRA+PDT compared to PDT. During the first 20 days post-ATRA+PDT, we obtained significant anti-tumor responses in HT-29 xenografts, including complete responses in 2/5 mice. In conclusion, ATRA+PDT represent a novel combination therapy for solid tumors that should be further tested in immunocompetent preclinical models.","Recent studies suggest that serum vitamin D may be associated with semen parameters. In the present cross-sectional study, we attempted to investigate the association between serum vitamin D levels and semen parameters among Iranian sub-fertile men. A total of 350 infertile men recruited for this cross-sectional study using a simple random sampling method with a mean age of 34.77 years old, body mass index of 26.67 kg/m2, serum vitamin D of 20.17 ng/ml, semen volume of 3.82 mL, sperm count of 44.48 (106/mL), sperm total motility of 38.10 %, and morphologically normal sperm of 7.0 %. After controlling for potential confounders, serum vitamin D was positively associated with semen volume (b = 0.63, 95 % CI: 0.06, 1.20), sperm count (b = 14.40, 95 % CI: 4.56, 24.25), sperm total motility (b = 18.12, 95 % CI: 12.37, 23.86), and sperm normal morphology (b = 1.95, 95 % CI: 1.07, 2.83). The present findings suggest that higher serum vitamin D levels are positively associated with higher semen volume, sperm count, sperm total motility, and normal morphology rate. These findings, however, do not specify a cause-and-effect relationship, and there is a need for further research in this area to understand whether vitamin D supplementation can improve semen parameters.","Background Lifestyle therapy with resistance training is a potent measure to counteract age-related loss in muscle strength and mass. Unfortunately, many individuals fail to respond in the expected manner. This phenomenon is particularly common among older adults and those chronically diseased (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD), and may involve endocrine variables such as vitamin D. At present, the effects of vitamin D supplementation on responses to resistance training remain largely unexplored.","Background Well-established risk factors for fertility problems such as smoking have been included in fertility awareness efforts globally. However, these efforts neglect risks that women in low and middle-income countries (LMIC) face.","Interpretable risk assessment of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients can aid clinicians to implement precision medicine. Here we trained a machine learning model to predict mortality within 12 weeks of a first positive SARS-CoV-2 test. By leveraging data on 33,928 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in eastern Denmark, we considered 2,723 variables extracted from electronic health records (EHR) including demographics, diagnoses, medications, laboratory test results and vital parameters. A discrete-time framework for survival modelling enabled us to predict personalized survival curves and explain individual risk factors. Performances of weighted concordance index 0.95 and precision-recall area under the curve 0.71 were measured on the test set. Age, sex, number of medications, previous hospitalizations and lymphocyte counts were identified as top mortality risk factors. Our explainable survival model developed on EHR data also revealed temporal dynamics of the 22 selected risk factors. Upon further validation, this model may allow direct reporting of personalized survival probabilities in routine care.","  Human genes required for SARS-CoV-2 entry into human cells, ACE2 and FURIN,\nwere employed as baits to build genomics-guided maps of up-stream regulatory\nelements, their expression and functions in human body, including\npathophysiologically-relevant cell types. Genes acting as repressors and\nactivators of the ACE2 and FURIN genes were identified based on the analyses of\ngene silencing and overexpression experiments as well as relevant transgenic\nmouse models. Panels of repressors (VDR; GATA5; SFTPC; HIF1a) and activators\n(HMGA2; INSIG1) were then employed to identify existing drugs that could be\nrepurposed to mitigate the coronavirus infection. Present analyses identify\nVitamin D and Quercetin as promising pandemic mitigation agents. Gene\nexpression profiles of Vitamin D and Quercetin activities and their established\nsafety records as over-the-counter medicinal substances suggest that they may\nrepresent viable candidates for further assessment and considerations of their\npotential as coronavirus pandemic mitigation agents. Notably, gene set\nenrichment analyses and expression profiling experiments identify multiple\ndrugs, most notably testosterone, dexamethasone, and doxorubicin, smoking, and\nmany disease conditions that appear to act as putative coronavirus\ninfection-promoting agents. Discordant patterns of Testosterone versus\nEstradiol impacts on SCARS-CoV-2 targets suggest a plausible molecular\nexplanation of the apparently higher male mortality during coronavirus\npandemic.\n","Testosterone is a hormone that plays a key role in carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism. Testosterone deficiency is associated with multiple comorbidities, e.g., metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Despite its importance in many metabolic pathways, the mechanisms by which it controls metabolism are not fully understood. The present study investigated the short-term metabolic changes of pharmacologically induced castration and testosterone supplementation in healthy young males. Thirty subjects were submitted to testosterone depletion (TD) followed by testosterone supplementation (TS). Plasma samples were collected three times corresponding to basal, low, and restored testosterone levels. An untargeted metabolomics study was performed by liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) to monitor the metabolic changes induced by the altered hormone levels. Our results demonstrated that TD is associated with major metabolic changes partially restored by TS. Carnitine and amino acid metabolism were the metabolic pathways most impacted by variations in testosterone. Furthermore, our results also indicate that LH and FSH might strongly alter the plasma levels of indoles and lipids, especially glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids. Our results demonstrate major metabolic changes induced by low testosterone that may be important for understanding the mechanisms behind the association of testosterone deficiency and its comorbidities.","Physical activity (PA) is known to be a protective lifestyle factor against several non-communicable diseases while its impact on infectious diseases, including Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not as clear. We performed univariate and multivariate logistic regression to identify associations between body mass index (BMI) and both objectively and subjectively measured PA collected prospectively and COVID-19 related outcomes (Overall COVID-19, inpatient COVID-19, outpatient COVID-19, and COVID-19 death) in the UK Biobank (UKBB) cohort. Subsequently, we tested causality by using two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis. In the multivariable model, the increased acceleration vector magnitude PA (AMPA) was associated with a decreased probability of overall and outpatient COVID-19. No association was found between self-reported moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) or BMI and COVID-19 related outcomes. Although no causal association was found by MR analyses, this may be due to limited power and we conclude policies to encourage and facilitate exercise at a population level during the pandemic should be considered.","Overlap of brain changes across mental disorders has reinforced transdiagnostic models. However, the developmental basis for this overlap is unclear as are neural differences among internalizing, externalizing and thought disorders. These issues are critical to inform the theoretical framework for hierarchical transdiagnostic psychiatric taxonomy. We examined cortical thickness (CT) difference between healthy controls (n=4041) and patients with externalizing (n=1182), internalizing (n=1959) and thought (n=347) disorders in preadolescents (9-10 years) from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Study using linear mixed models. Genome-wide association analysis and cell type specificity analysis were performed on regional CT across 4,716 unrelated European youth. We found that youth with externalizing or internalizing disorders, but not thought disorders, exhibited significantly thicker cortex than controls. Externalizing and internalizing disorders shared thicker CT in left pars opercularis and caudal middle frontal gyrus related to lower cognitive performance. Somatosensory and primary auditory cortex were uniquely affected in externalizing disorders; primary motor cortex and higher-order visual association areas were uniquely affected in internalizing disorders. Only group of externalizing disorders demonstrated significant CT increase than controls at 2-year follow-up and decelerated cortical thinning from 10 to 12 years old. At genetic level, genes associated with CT in common and disorders-specific regions were also implicated in related diagnostic families. Microglia were the cell-type associated with CT for both externalizing/internalizing while dopaminergic/glutamatergic/GABAergic cells related only to externalizing-specific regions. These results showed that distinct anatomical trajectories relevant to internalizing/externalizing phenotypes may result from unique genetic and cell-type changes, but these occur in the background of significantly shared morphological variance.","Estrogen receptor \u03b2 (ER\u03b2) was first identified in the rodent prostate and is abundantly expressed in human and rodent prostate epithelium, stroma, immune cells and endothelium of the blood vessels. In the prostates of mice with inactivated ER\u03b2, mutant phenotypes include epithelial hyperplasia and increased expression of androgen receptor (AR)-regulated genes, most of which are also upregulated in prostate cancer (PCa). ER\u03b2 is expressed in both basal and luminal cells in the prostate while AR is expressed in luminal but not in the basal cell layer which harbors the prostate stem cells. To investigate the mechanisms of action of ER\u03b2 and its potential cross-talk with AR, we used RNA-seq to study the effects of estradiol or the synthetic ligand, LY3201, in AR-positive LNCaP PCa cells which had been engineered to express ER\u03b2. Transcriptomic analysis indicated relatively few changes in gene expression with ER\u03b2 overexpression, but robust responses following ligand treatments. There is significant overlap of responsive genes between the two ligands, as well as ligand-specific alterations. Gene set analysis of down-regulated genes identified an enrichment of androgen-responsive genes, such as FKBP5, CAMKK2, and TBC1D4. Consistently, AR transcript, protein levels, and transcriptional activity were down-regulated following ER\u03b2 activation. In agreement with this, we find that the phosphorylation of the CAMKK2 target, AMPK, was repressed by ligand-activated ER\u03b2. Down-regulation of TBC1D4, a major regulator of glucose uptake in prostate, indicates that ER\u03b2 is changing glucose metabolism in the prostate. These findings suggest that ER\u03b2-mediated signaling pathways are involved in the negative regulation of AR expression and activity, thus supporting a tumor suppressive role for ER\u03b2 in PCa.","Abstract We present a, mathematical model driven, framework to implement virtual or imaginary clinical trials (phase i trials) that can be used to bridge the gap between preclinical studies and the clinic. The trial implementation process includes the development of an experimentally validated mathematical model, generation of a cohort of heterogeneous virtual patients, an assessment of stratification factors, and optimization of treatment strategy. We show the detailed process through application to melanoma treatment, using a combination therapy of chemotherapy and an AKT inhibitor, which was recently tested in a phase 1 clinical trial. We developed a mathematical model, composed of ordinary differential equations, based on experimental data showing that such therapies differentially induce autophagy in melanoma cells. Model parameters were estimated using an optimization algorithm that minimizes differences between predicted cell populations and experimentally measured cell numbers. The calibrated model was validated by comparing predicted cell populations with experimentally measured melanoma cell populations in twelve different treatment scheduling conditions. By using this validated model as the foundation for a genetic algorithm, we generated a cohort of virtual patients that mimics the heterogeneous combination therapy responses observed in a companion clinical trial. Sensitivity analysis of this cohort defined parameters that discriminated virtual patients having more favorable versus less favorable outcomes. Finally, the model predicts optimal therapeutic approaches across all virtual patients.","Background and objectives In an effort to improve donor health, we set out to investigate determinants other than blood donation that increase risk of ID in a healthy population and if they should be implemented into current blood donor selection processes.","Introduction The global pandemic of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and has since spread worldwide.[1] This study attempts to summarize current evidence regarding major inflammatory markers, severity predictors and its impact on outcome, which provide current clinical experience and treatment guidance for this novel coronavirus.","Background SARS-CoV-2 infection has severely ravaged health systems, economic and social progress globally in 2020. Seroprevalence studies can provide relevant information on the target populations for vaccination. They are relevant not only in the community, but also for critical population subgroups such as nursing homes or health care facilities. They will assist in strategizing the vaccination policy especially since there is limited availability of the vaccine and vaccine hesitancy","Objectives To audit implementation of a local protocol for the treatment of vitamin D deficiency (VDD) among patients hospitalized for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), including an assessment of the prevalence of VDD in these patients, and of potential associations with disease severity and fatality.","Objective To explore the correlation between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and tic disorders (TDs) in Chinese children. Methods We selected 2960 children with TD and 2665 healthy controls, aged 5-14 years, from the Department of Neurology of the Shanghai Children's Hospital. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and degrees of vitamin D deficiency were compared between patients with TD and healthy children. Results The mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level in the TD group was significantly lower than that in the control group (P &lt; 0.001). The proportion of patients with 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency in the TD group was significantly higher than that in the control group. However, there was no correlation between 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency and the severity of TD. In addition, for age-wise comparison, mean levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and its deficiency in the TD group were the most significant in children over 9 years of age. Conclusion There is a correlation between 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency and TD in Chinese children, but not between 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency and the severity of TD. There was a correlation between age and deficiency of 25-hydroxyvitamin D; this deficiency was most pronounced among those over the age of 9 years. ","  Recently, Mackenzie et al. reported incidence and prevalence of multiple\nsclerosis (MS) in the UK from 1990-2010. Authors of this report indicated that\nthey could not explain the cause of decreasing MS incidence trend in the UK\nduring this time period. Such inability mainly resulted from the fact that\noften-cited hypotheses of MS, such as vitamin D deficiency hypothesis, cannot\nprovide any answer for MS incidence trends. However, the newly proposed\nhypothesis of MS that is based on the biological effects of geomagnetic\ndisturbances (GMD) has the ability to provide explanations for this observed\ntrend. In this commentary, we showed that there is a significant correlation\namong alterations in GMD with changes in MS incidence and explained how\nresearchers can use GMD hypothesis to evaluate such relations. Moreover, we\nclarified why we need a revision in the method of reporting MS incidence data\nto find actual environmental factor of MS.\n","Health systems are stewards of patient electronic health record (EHR) data with extraordinarily rich depth and breadth, reflecting thousands of diagnoses and exposures. Measures of genomic variation integrated with EHRs offer a potential strategy to accurately stratify patients for risk profiling and discover new relationships between diagnoses and genomes. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) for common cancers are associated with multiple phenotypes in a Phenome-wide Association Study (PheWAS) conducted in 28,260 unrelated, genotyped patients of recent European ancestry who consented to participate in the Michigan Genomics Initiative, a longitudinal biorepository effort within Michigan Medicine. PRS for 12 cancer traits were calculated using summary statistics from the NHGRI-EBI catalog. A total of 1,711 synthetic case-control studies was used for PheWAS analyses. There were 13,490 (47.7%) patients with at least one cancer diagnosis in this study sample. PRSs exhibited strong association for several cancer traits they were designed for including female breast cancer, prostate cancer, melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and thyroid cancer. Phenome-wide significant associations were observed between PRS and many non-cancer diagnoses. To differentiate PRS associations driven by the primary trait from associations arising through shared genetic risk profiles, the idea of \u201cexclusion PRS PheWAS\u201d was introduced. This approach led to phenome-wide significant associations between a lower risk for hypothyroidism in patients with high thyroid cancer PRS and a higher risk for actinic keratosis in patients with high squamous cell carcinoma PRS after removing all cases of the primary cancer trait. Further analysis of temporal order of the diagnoses improved our understanding of these secondary associations. This is the first comprehensive PheWAS study using PRS instead of a single variant.","COVID19 is a heterogeneous medical condition involving a suite of underlying pathophysiological processes including hyperinflammation, endothelial damage, thrombotic microangiopathy, and end-organ damage. Limited knowledge about the molecular mechanisms driving these processes and lack of staging biomarkers hamper the ability to stratify patients for targeted therapeutics. We report here the results of a cross-sectional multi-omics analysis of hospitalized COVID19 patients revealing that seroconversion status associates with distinct underlying pathophysiological states. Seronegative COVID19 patients harbor hyperactive T cells and NK cells, high levels of IFN alpha, gamma and lambda ligands, markers of systemic complement activation, neutropenia, lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia. In seropositive patients, all of these processes are attenuated, observing instead increases in B cell subsets, emergency hematopoiesis, increased markers of platelet activation, and hypoalbuminemia. We propose that seroconversion status could potentially be used as a biosignature to stratify patients for therapeutic intervention and to inform analysis of clinical trial results in heterogenous patient populations.","  To investigate the role of tachysterol in the photophysical/chemical\nregulation of vitamin D photosynthesis, we studied its electronic absorption\nproperties and excited state dynamics using time-dependent density functional\ntheory (TDDFT), coupled cluster theory (CC2), and non-adiabatic molecular\ndynamics. In excellent agreement with experiments, the simulated electronic\nspectrum shows a broad absorption band covering the spectra of the other\nvitamin D photoisomers. The broad band stems from the spectral overlap of four\ndifferent ground state rotamers. After photoexcitation, the first excited\nsinglet state (S1) decays within 882 fs. The S1 dynamics is characterized by a\nstrong twisting of the central double bond. 96% of all trajectories relax\nwithout chemical transformation to the ground state. In 2.3 % of the\ntrajectories we observed [1,5]-sigmatropic hydrogen shift forming the partly\ndeconjugated toxisterol D1. 1.4 % previtamin D formation is observed via\nhula-twist double bond isomerization. We find a strong dependence between\nphotoreactivity and dihedral angle conformation: hydrogen shift only occurs in\ncEc and cEt rotamers and double bond isomerization occurs mainly in cEc\nrotamers. Our study confirms the hypothesis that cEc rotamers are more prone to\nprevitamin D formation than other isomers. We also observe the formation of a\ncyclobutene-toxisterol in the hot ground state (0.7 %). Due to its strong\nabsorption and unreactive behavior, tachysterol acts mainly as a sun shield\nsuppressing previtamin D formation. Tachysterol shows stronger toxisterol\nformation than previtamin D. Absorption of low energy UV light by the cEc\nrotamer can lead to previtamin D formation. Our study reinforces a recent\nhypothesis that tachysterol can act as a previtamin D source when only low\nenergy ultraviolet light is available, as it is the case in winter or in the\nmorning and evening hours of the day.\n","Background Prospective population-based studies investigating multiple determinants of pre-vaccination antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 are lacking.","Parathyroid hormone related-protein (PTHrP) is a pleiotropic regulator of tissue homeostasis. In bone, knockdown in osteocytes by Dmp1Cre-targeted deletion causes osteopenia and impaired strength. We report that this outcome depends on parental genotype. Adult Dmp1Cre.Pthlhf/f mice from homozygous parents (Dmp1Cre.Pthlhf/f(hom)) have stronger bones, with 40% more trabecular bone mass and 30% greater femoral width than controls. At 12 days old, greater bone width was also found in male and female Dmp1Cre.Pthlhf/f(hom) mice, but not in gene-matched mice from heterozygous parents, suggesting a maternal influence before weaning. Milk PTHrP levels were normal, but decidua from mothers of Dmp1Cre.Pthlhf/f(hom) mice were smaller, with low PTHrP levels. Moreover, Dmp1Cre.Pthlhf/f(hom) embryonic bone was more mineralized and wider than control. We conclude that Dmp1Cre leads to gene recombination in decidua, and that decidual PTHrP influences decidual cell maturation and limits embryonic bone growth. This identifies a maternal-derived developmental origin of adult bone strength.","Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is a hormone secreted from fully differentiated osteoblasts and osteocytes that inhibits phosphate reabsorption by kidney proximal tubules. The full-length (i.e., intact) protein mediates FGF23 endocrine functions, while endoproteolytic cleavage at a consensus cleavage sequence for the proprotein convertases (PCs) inactivates FGF23. Two PCs, furin and PC5, were shown to cleave FGF23 in vitro at RHTR179\u2193, but whether they are fulfilling this function in vivo is currently unknown. To address this question we used here mice lacking either or both furin and PC5 in cell-specific manners and mice lacking the paired basic amino acid-cleaving enzyme 4 (PACE4) in all cells. Our analysis shows that furin inactivation in osteoblasts and osteocytes results in a 25% increase in circulating intact FGF23, without any significant impact on serum phosphate levels, whether mice are maintained on a normal or a low phosphate diet. Under conditions of iron deficiency, FGF23 is normally processed in control mice, but its processing is impaired in mice lacking furin in osteoblasts and osteocytes. In contrast, FGF23 is normally cleaved following erythropoietin or IL-1\u03b2 injections in mice lacking furin or both furin and PC5, and in PACE4-deficient mice. Altogether, these studies suggest that furin is only partially responsible for FGF23 cleavage under certain conditions in vivo. The processing of FGF23 may therefore involve the redundant action of multiple PCs or of other peptidases in osteoblasts, osteocytes and hematopoietic cells.","A potential protective role of vitamin D serum levels on overall adverse outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 on populations had been suggested previously based upon single-point cross-sectional analysis of 8 April 2020 data from 20 European countries assuming comparable underlying confounding variables for these populations, at an early stage of the current pandemic. Comparative time-series cross-sectional analysis of the COVID-19 data from 12 March (early pre-peak) to 26 July (late post-peak of infections) 2020 was performed to assess the strength of the assertion. The study subjects included 1,829,634 COVID-19 cases (11.11% of total worldwide) and 179,135 associated deaths (27.45 % of total worldwide) on 26 July 2012. Previously suggested cross-sectional study design and methodology could not consistently and significantly (p-value\u22650.05) support the notion of the potential protective role of the mean serum vitamin D levels of the populations on COVID-19 incidence and mortality. However, the exponential correlative model, as well as alternative simple regression analysis on ln and Log10 transformed COVID-19 data for the time period indicated improved consistently negative covariation with vitamin D levels. Additionally, the later methodology increased the predictive potential for explaining the variability in data [R2 by 1.27-1.96 fold, adjusted-R2 by 1.33-2.47, p-value=0.0457-0.0035, for cases/million; R2 by 1.81-2.67, adjusted-R2 by 2.21-3.74 fold for deaths/million, p-value=0.0049-0.0228). Considering, the established role of vitamin D in immune system functioning randomized well-controlled trials may be suggested to evaluate/assess the potential protective role of vitamin D in reducing the COVID-19 impact on populations.","Background and objectives Low levels of vitamin D among dark-skinned migrants to northern latitudes and increased risks for associated pathologies illustrate an evolutionary mismatch between an environment of high ultraviolet (UV) radiation to which such migrants are adapted and the low-UV environment to which they migrate. Recently, low levels of vitamin D have also been associated with higher risks for contracting COVID-19. South Asians in the UK have higher risk for low vitamin D levels. In this study, we assessed vitamin D status of British-Bangladeshi migrants compared to white British residents and Bangladeshis still living in Bangladesh (\u2018sedentees\u2019).","Musculoskeletal conditions, including fractures, can have severe and long-lasting consequences. Higher body mass index in adulthood is widely acknowledged to be protective for most fracture sites, indicated through previous clinical and epidemiological observational research. However, the association between weight and bone health is complex and sources of bias, induced by confounding factors, may have distorted earlier findings. Employing a lifecourse Mendelian randomization (MR) approach by using genetic instruments to separate effects at different life stages, this investigation aims to explore how prepubertal and adult body size independently influence fracture risk in later life.","Introduction In March 2020 the World Health Organisation (WHO) released a Global Research Roadmap in an effort to coordinate and accelerate the global research response to combat COVID-19 based on deliberations of 400 experts across the world. Three months on, the disease and our understanding have both evolved significantly. As we now tackle a pandemic in very different contexts and with increased knowledge, we sought to build on the work of the WHO to gain a more current and global perspective on these initial priorities.","Omeg@Silica microparticles consisting of whole fish oil rich in omega-3 lipids, vitamin D3 and zeaxanthin extracted with biobased limonene from anchovy fillet leftovers (AnchoisOil) encapsulated within mesoporous silica particles are highly effective in modulating oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage or in promoting antitumor effects in lung cancer cells. A panel of three different human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines (A549, Colo 699 and SKMES) was used. Cancer cells were treated with AnchoisOil dispersed in ethanol (10 and 15 \u03bcg/ml) or encapsulated in silica, and cell cycle, reactive oxigen species (ROS) and mitochondrial stress (MitoSOX) assessed by flow cytometry. The effects on long-term proliferation (clonogenic assay) were also evaluated. The sub-micron Omeg@Silica microparticles were more effective than fish oil alone in increasing ROS and mitocondrial damage, in altering cell cycle as well as in reducing colony formation ability in the tested lung cancer cell lines. These results suggest that Omeg@Silica mesoporous silica functionalized with whole fish oil has antitumor effects in NSCLC cell lines and support its investigation in lung cancer therapy.","We revealed critical vulnerabilities of nutrient content claims under FDA per serving size (serving), CAC per 100 g or mL, CAC per serving, and CAC per 100 kcal and developed the proposed method to remove all vulnerabilities. We calculated the nutrient content of foods based on nutrient content claims under the proposed method. Then, we determined nutrient content claims for foods and food groups, and specified similarities between nutrient content claims in food groups. Also, we ranked foods and food groups based on met claims of the nutrient content. Nutrient content claims based on the proposed method, including free, very low, low, source, and high claims were determined in 8596 food items, 29 nutrients, and 25 food groups of the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, release 28. Source and high claims are used for positive nutrients (including vitamins, minerals except sodium, protein, and dietary fiber). The very low claim is used for sodium, and free and low claims are used for cholesterol, energy, saturated fat, sodium, and total fat (also known as negative nutrients). In general, critical vulnerabilities of nutrient content claims under FDA and CAC can cause: (1) excessive energy intake based on FDA and CAC per serving and CAC per 100 g or mL; (2) exceeding the DV (NRV) for low nutrients under FDA per serving and CAC per 100 g or mL by consuming small amounts of foods per day; (3) the presence of nutrient free, but not low nutrient, foods based on FDA per serving and CAC per 100 g or mL; (4) the calculation of nutrient content in inappropriate amounts of foods based on FDA per serving, CAC per 100 g or mL, CAC per 100 kcal, and CAC per serving; and (5) determination of energy from total fat and saturated fat for relevant claims in inappropriate portions based on FDA per serving and CAC per 100 g or mL. Breakfast cereals, baby foods, pork products, lamb, veal, and game products, poultry products, and beef products had the highest average of scores for source and high nutrients. Restaurant foods, fast foods, and sausages and luncheon meats had the lowest average of scores for free, very low, and low nutrients. Nutrient source or high nutrient foods for all 24 positive nutrients were found in seven food groups (American Indian/Alaska Native foods; baby foods; beverages; dairy and egg products; legumes and legume products; meals, entrees, and side dishes; vegetables and vegetable products). There were very few source and high foods for potassium and vitamin D. Also, there were very few energy free foods.","The UK Biobank Exome Sequencing Consortium (UKB-ESC) is a unique private/public partnership between the UK Biobank and eight biopharma companies that will sequence the exomes of all \u223c500,000 UK Biobank participants. Here we describe early results from the exome sequence data generated by this consortium for the first \u223c200,000 UKB subjects and the key features of this project that enabled the UKB-ESC to come together and generate this data.","COVID-19 has had considerable global impact, but in sub-Saharan Africa is one of several infectious disease priorities. Prioritization is normally guided by disease burden, but the highly age-dependent nature of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases makes comparisons challenging unless considered through metrics that incorporate life years lost and time lived in adverse health. We therefore compared 2020 mortality and Disability-Adjusted Life Years lost (DALYs lost) estimates for malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan African populations with 12+ months of COVID-19 burden (up to end March 2021), applying known age-related mortality to United Nations estimates of age structure. We further compared exacerbations of disease burden predicted from the COVID-19 public health response. Data was derived from public sources, predicted exacerbations derived from those published by international agencies. For sub-Saharan African populations north of South Africa, recorded COVID-19 DALYs lost in 2020 was 3.7%, 2.3%, and 2.4% of those estimated for tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and malaria respectively. Predicted exacerbations of these comparator diseases were greater than the estimated COVID-19 burden. Including South Africa and Lesotho, COVID-19 DALYs lost were &lt;12% of those for comparator diseases and dominated by them in all age groups below 65 years. The analysis suggests a relatively low impact from COVID-19. While all four epidemics continue, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and malaria remain far greater health priorities based on disease burden. Resource diversion to COVID-19 therefore runs a high risk of increasing the overall disease burden and causing net harm, further increasing global inequities in health and life expectancy.","Mutations in TRPC6 are a cause of autosomal dominant focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in humans. Many of these mutations are known to have a gain-of-function effect on the non-specific cation channel function of TRPC6. In vitro studies have suggested these mutations affect several signaling pathways, but in vivo studies have largely compared wild-type and Trpc6-deficient rodents. We developed mice carrying a gain-of-function Trpc6 mutation encoding an E896K amino acid change, corresponding to a known FSGS mutation in TRPC6. Homozygous mutant Trpc6 animals have no appreciable renal pathology, and do not develop albuminuria until very advanced age. The Trpc6E896K mutation does not impart susceptibility to PAN nephrosis. The animals show a slight delay in recovery from the albumin overload model. In response to chronic angiotensin II infusion, Trpc6E896K/E896K mice have slightly greater albuminuria initially compared to wild-type animals, an effect that is lost at later time points, and a statistically non-significant trend toward more glomerular injury. This phenotype is nearly opposite to that of Trpc6-deficient animals previously described. The Trpc6 mutation does not appreciably impact renal interstitial fibrosis in response to either angiotensin II infusion, or folate-induced kidney injury. TRPC6 protein and TRPC6-agonist induced calcium influx could not be detected in glomeruli. In sum, these findings suggest that a gain-of-function Trpc6 mutation confers only a mild susceptibility to glomerular injury in the mouse.","","COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 (1), was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020 (2). While awaiting a vaccine, several antivirals are being used to manage the disease with limited success (3, 4). To expand this arsenal, we screened 4 compound libraries: a United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug library, an angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) targeted compound library, a flavonoid compound library as well as a natural product library. Of the 121 compounds identified with activity against SARS-CoV-2, 7 were shortlisted for validation. We show for the first time that the active form of Vitamin D, calcitriol, exhibits significant potent activity against SARS-CoV-2. This finding paves the way for consideration of host-directed therapies for ring prophylaxis of contacts of SARS-CoV-2 patients.","Objectives To investigate awareness and indicators of low energy availability (LEA) in male and female dancers","Background The characterization of new biomarkers of COVID-19 is extremely important. Few studies measured the soluble receptor for advanced glycation end product (sRAGE), angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), calcium and magnesium in COVID-19.","Background Skin cancer incidence has been increasing worldwide, representing a particularly high burden for populations of European ancestry. Outdoor and indoor tanning using ultraviolet radiation (UVR) devices are major risk factors for skin cancer. While tanning behaviours can be modified by targeted interventions to reduce skin cancer rates, there is insufficient evidence on the motivations for tanning preferences and their relationship with pigmentation phenotypes. The present observational and genetically- informed study investigates motives for tanning and the role that pigmentation phenotypes play on outdoor and indoor tanning behaviour in British young adults.","Advances in our understanding of complex COVID-19 pandemic would allow us to effectively eliminate and eradicate SARS-COV2 virus. Although tremendous amount of research devoted to the robustness across its biology, diagnostics, vaccines and treatment has exploded in the past two years. However, still science do not have robust answers for causes, for example (i) What are the reasons of non-uniform global distribution of COVID-19? (ii) Why the United States, India, and Brazil, are the first-three most affected nations?, (iii) How did Bhutan, a nation sharing a boundary with China manage nearly 0.34% infections and 3 deaths from COVID-19? Nonetheless, the biomass bistribution of biosphere report suggest more than 1550-fold larger microbial biomass involving bacteria, fungi, archaea, protists and viruses is exist in comparision to all global human population in the biosphere. The rich microbiota act a first line of defence to invade pathogens and affect us both through the environment and microbiome. Unfortunately, a role of pathogen-transmission factors viz. implicit factors (competitive microflora) is still under represented. This study is an attempt from a gold standard correlation methodology using a large pesticide use global data. The non-specific pesticides kill both pests as well as protective microbiota, resulting a loss in rich biodiversity and allow easy pathogen entry to human. Entire predictions were found consistent with the recently observed evidences. These insights enhanced scientific ability to interrogate viral epidemiology and recommended to limit pesticide use for future pandemic prevention.","The E3 ligase FBW7 targets drivers of cell cycle progression such as c-MYC for proteasomal degradation. It is frequently mutated in cancer, and is a tumor suppressor. Extensive epidemiological data links vitamin D deficiency to increased incidence of several cancers, although the underlying cancer-preventive mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we show that hormonal 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D) rapidly stimulates the interaction of the VDR with FBW7, and that of FBW7 with c-MYC. In contrast, it blocks the association of FBW7 with c-MYC antagonist MXD1. 1,25D also enhances the association of FBW7, proteasome subunits, and ubiquitin with DNA-bound c-MYC, consistent with induced degradation of c-MYC on DNA. In addition to c-MYC, 1,25D accelerates the turnover of other FBW7 target proteins. Intriguingly, FBW7 is essential for optimal VDR gene expression. It is also recruited to VDR targets genes, and its depletion attenuates 1,25D-stimulated VDR DNA binding, transactivation, and cell cycle arrest. Thus, the VDR and FBW7 are mutual cofactors, which provides a molecular basis for the cancer-preventive actions of vitamin D through accelerated turnover of FBW7 target proteins.","Background Vitamin D modulates the inflammatory and immune response to tuberculosis (TB) and also mediates the induction of the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin. Deficiency of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene may increase the risk of TB disease and decrease culture conversion rates in drug susceptible TB. Whether these VDR SNPs are found in African populations or impact multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB treatment has not been established. We aimed to determine if SNPs in the VDR gene were associated with sputum culture conversion among a cohort of MDR TB patients in South Africa.","Background We examined whether the greater severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) amongst men and non-White ethnicities is explained by cardiometabolic, socio-economic, or behavioural factors.","The COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected over 100 million people causing over 2.4 million deaths over the world, and it is still expanding. Given the urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic, the clinical investigation of approved drugs is a promising alternative to find a timely effective treatment. In this randomized trial, we investigated the activity of both oral and aerosolized 13 cis retinoic acid in the treatment of SARS-COV-2 added to standard of care treatment in patients with COVID-19 versus standard of care treatment alone. This was a randomized controlled trial conducted at Kafrelsheikh University\u2019s Quarantine Hospitals, Egypt. After obtaining informed consent, forty patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were enrolled in the study. They were randomly assigned to one of two groups: Group I; 20 patients received aerosolized and oral 13 cis retinoic acid plus standard of care treatment (13 cis RA group) and Group II; 20 patients received only standard care treatment as a control group. The two groups were age and gender matched. There was no statistically significant difference between them in any of the baseline characteristics or laboratory parameters. The results showed that there was a high significant difference between the two groups regarding intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mortality and improvement (P&lt;0.05). Only 10.52 % of patients in the 13 cis retinoic acid group needed ICU admission compared to 28.57 % in the control arm. There was no mortality in the 13 cis retinoic acid group, whereas about 14.35% were died in the group II. All patients who received 13 cis retinoic acid noticed a high improvement (P&lt;0.001), and the mean value for clinical improvement was 16.3\u00b14.5 days. There was no significant difference regarding the laboratory parameters before and after 14 days of treatment in the group of patients received the standard of care treatment (P=0.66). Univariate logistic regression analysis showed overall mortality was significantly related to the patient\u2019s age, serum ferritin, C-reactive protein, oxygen saturation, the presence of diabetes mellitus, obesity, and abdominal pain. We conclude that 13 cis retinoic acid is a promising drug in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 infection, when added to the standard of care treatment.","As a novel approach we will combine trajectories or longitudinal studies of gene expression with information on annual influenza epidemics. Seasonality of gene expression in immune cells from blood could be a consequence of within-host seasonal immunity interacting with the seasonal pandemics of influenza (flu) in temperate regions and, thus, with potential valuable analogy transfer to the proposed seasonal development of covid-19.","Background Risk factors for severe COVID-19 include older age, male sex, obesity, Black or Asian ethnicity and underlying medical conditions. Whether these factors also influence susceptibility to developing COVID-19 is uncertain.","Evidence is growing for a role of vitamin D in regulating skeletal muscle mass, strength and functional capacity. Given the role the kidneys play in activating total vitamin D, and the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), it is possible that deficiency contributes to the low levels of physical function and muscle mass in these patients. This is a secondary cross-sectional analysis of previously published interventional study, with ex vivo follow up work. 34 CKD patients at stages G3b-5 (eGFR 25.5 \u00b1 8.3ml/min/1.73m2; age 61 \u00b1 12 years) were recruited, with a sub-group (n=20) also donating a muscle biopsy. Vitamin D and associated metabolites were analysed in plasma by liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectroscopy and correlated to a range of physiological tests of muscle size, function, exercise capacity and body composition. The effects of 1\u03b1,25(OH)2D3 supplementation on myogenesis and myotube size was investigated in primary skeletal muscle cells from vitamin D deficient donors. In vivo, there was no association between total or active vitamin D and muscle size or strength, but a significant correlation with  was seen with the total form. Ex vivo, 1\u03b1,25(OH)2D3 supplementation reduced IL-6 mRNA expression, but had no effect upon proliferation, differentiation or myotube diameter. This early preliminary work suggests that vitamin D deficiency is not a prominent factor driving the loss of muscle mass in CKD, but may play a role in reduced exercise capacity.","There are significant differences in the biology of males and females, ranging from biochemical pathways to behavioural responses, which are relevant to modern medicine. Broad-sense heritability estimates differ between the sexes for many common medical disorders, indicating that genetic architecture can be sex-dependent. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified sex-specific and sex-biased effects, where in addition to sex-specific effects on gene expression, twenty-two medical traits have sex-specific or sex-biased loci. Sex-specific genetic architecture of complex traits is also extensively documented in model organisms using genome-wide linkage or association mapping, and in gene disruption studies. The evolutionary origins of sex-specific genetic architecture and sexual dimorphism lie in the fact that males and females share most of their genetic variation yet experience different selection pressures. At the extreme is sexual antagonism, where selection on an allele acts in opposite directions between the sexes. Sexual antagonism has been repeatedly identified via a number of experimental methods in a range of different taxa. Although the molecular basis remains to be identified, mathematical models predict the maintenance of deleterious variants that experience selection in a sex-dependent manner. There are multiple mechanisms by which sexual antagonism and alleles under sex-differential selection could contribute toward the genetics of common, complex disorders. The evidence we review clearly indicates that further research into sex-dependent selection and the sex-specific genetic architecture of diseases would be rewarding. This would be aided by studies of laboratory and wild animal populations, and by modelling sex-specific effects in genome-wide association data with joint, gene-by-sex interaction tests. We predict that even sexually monomorphic diseases may harbour cryptic sex-specific genetic architecture. Furthermore, empirical evidence suggests that investigating sex-dependent epistasis may be especially rewarding. Finally, the prevalent nature of sex-specific genetic architecture in disease offers scope for the development of more effective, sex-specific therapies.","Tuberculosis is a significant public health concern resulting in the death of over 1 million individuals each year worldwide. While treatment options and vaccines exist, a substantial number of infections still remain untreated or are caused by treatment resistant strains. Therefore, it is important to identify mechanisms that contribute to risk and prognosis of tuberculosis as this may provide tools to understand disease mechanisms and provide novel treatment options for those with severe infection. Our goal was to identify genetic risk factors that contribute to the risk of tuberculosis and to understand biological mechanisms and causality behind the risk of tuberculosis. A total of 1,895 individuals in the FinnGen study had ICD-based tuberculosis diagnosis. GWAS analysis identified genetic variants with statistically significant association with tuberculosis at the Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region (p&lt;5e-8) and at rs560595454 in gene INPP5A. Fine mapping the HLA-association provided evidence for one protective haplotype tagged by HLA DQB1*05:01 (p=1.82E-06, OR = 0.81 [CI 95 % 0.74-0.88]), and predisposing alleles tagged by HLA DRB1*13:02 (p=0.00011, OR = 1.35 [CI 95% 1.16-1.57]). Furthermore, genetic correlation analysis showed association with earlier reported risk factors including smoking (p&lt;0.05). Mendelian randomization supported smoking as a risk factor for tuberculosis (inverse-variance weighted p&lt;0.05, OR = 1.83 [CI 95 % 1.15-2.93]) with no significant evidence of pleiotropy. Our findings indicate that specific HLA alleles and INPP5A associate with the risk of tuberculosis. In addition, lifestyle risk factors such as smoking contribute to the risk of developing tuberculosis.","University students are a vulnerable group for poor dietary intake, insufficient physical activity and sedentary behaviour. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of COVID-19 on university students\u2019 dietary intake, physical activity and sedentary behaviour. Participants were students (n=125) from the Universities of Saskatchewan and Regina. An online questionnaire was administered retrospectively (for pre-pandemic) and prospectively (during the pandemic) to examine students\u2019 dietary intake, physical activity and sedentary behaviour. Overall, nutrient and caloric intakes were significantly reduced (p&lt;0.05) during the pandemic, and alcohol intake increased (p=0.03). Before the pandemic, 16% and 54% of the participants were meeting the Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines for Adults (18\u201364 years) of 150 minutes of moderate-vigorous physical activity and 8 hours or less of sedentary activity respectively. Only 10% met the guidelines for physical activity while 30% met the guidelines for sedentary behaviour during the pandemic. The minutes per week spent engaging in moderate to vigorous physical activity during the pandemic decreased by approximately 20% (p&lt;0.001). The hours spent in sedentary activities increased by 3 hours per day (p&lt;0.001). Our findings confirm that during the pandemic, students\u2019 inadequate dietary intake, high alcohol consumption, low physical activity and high sedentary behaviour were significantly compounded.","Adverse effects of low vitamin D level on mortality and morbidity are controversially discussed. Especially older people are at risk for vitamin D deficiency and therefore exposed to its potentially harmful influence on the aging process. A way of measuring differences in the biological age is through DNA methylation age (DNAm age) and its deviation from chronological age, DNAm age acceleration (DNAmAA). We previously reported on an association between vitamin D deficiency and higher 7-CpG DNAmAA in participants of the Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II).","Background The viral entry of SARS-CoV-2 requires host-expressed TMPRSS2 to facilitate the viral spike (S) protein priming.","BACKGROUND The aim of this study is to identify seasonal changes in total 25(OH) vitamin D (VD) concentrations and determine its influence on acute upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) morbidity among elite athletes engaged in water sports.","  The ultrafast photoinduced ring-opening of 1,3-cyclohexadiene constitutes a\ntextbook example of electrocyclic reactions in organic chemistry and a model\nfor photobiological reactions in vitamin D synthesis. Here, we present direct\nand unambiguous observation of the ring-opening reaction path on the\nfemtosecond timescale and sub-{\\AA}ngstr\\\"om length scale by megaelectronvolt\nultrafast electron diffraction. We follow the carbon-carbon bond dissociation\nand the structural opening of the 1,3-cyclohexadiene ring by direct measurement\nof time-dependent changes in the distribution of interatomic distances. We\nobserve a substantial acceleration of the ring-opening motion after internal\nconversion to the ground state due to steepening of the electronic potential\ngradient towards the product minima. The ring-opening motion transforms into\nrotation of the terminal ethylene groups in the photoproduct 1,3,5-hexatriene\non the sub-picosecond timescale. Our work demonstrates the potential of\nmegaelectronvolt ultrafast electron diffraction to elucidate photochemical\nreaction paths in organic chemistry.\n","Data from adult studies how that COVID-19 is more severe in men than women. However, no data are available for the pediatric population. For this reason, we performed this study aiming to understand if sex influenced disease severity and outcomes in a large cohort of latin-american children with COVID-19 and Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C). We found that a higher percentage of male children developed MIS-C (8.9% vs 5% in females) and died (1.2% and 0.4% in females), although on multivariate adjusted analyses the only statistically significant difference was found in need of hospitalization, with females less frequently admitted compared with boys (25.6% vs 35.4%). This data are preliminary and need further independent studies to better assess the role of sex.","Background As of the end of 2021 year, the rate of completion for second-dose administration was almost 80% in Japan.","BACKGROUND Vitamin D metabolites support innate immune responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and other respiratory pathogens. Randomized controlled trials of vitamin D to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) have not yet reported.","The interaction between inclement weather and disease acquisition is a long-recognized relationship. In the case of coccidiosis, a parasitic infestation of the intestines, wet weather is known to promote incidences in livestock. Our opportunistic investigation tracks blood chemistries of goats that were exposed to coccidian in a 100 year rain event in Oklahoma. Our results suggest a potentially patterned response of blood chemistries that may be developed into a clinical tool in the future and provide warnings for producers of the risks associated with growing incidences of excessively wet weather related to climate change.","Numerous aspects of cellular signaling are regulated by the kinome \u2013 the network of over 500 protein kinases that guides and modulates information transfer throughout the cell. The key role played by both individual kinases and assemblies of kinases organized into functional subnetworks leads to kinome dysregulation being a key driver of many diseases, particularly cancer. In the case of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a variety of kinases and associated signaling pathways have been identified for their key role in the establishment of disease as well as its progression. However, the identification of additional relevant therapeutic targets has been slow and is further confounded by interactions between the tumor and the surrounding tumor microenvironment. Fundamentally, it is an open question as to the degree to which knowledge of the state of the kinome at the protein level is able to provide insight into the downstream phenotype of the cell.","The seasonality of influenza viruses and endemic human coronaviruses was tracked over an 8-year period to assess key epidemiologic reduction points in disease incidence for an urban area in the northeast United States. Patients admitted to a pediatric hospital with worsening respiratory symptoms were tested using a multiplex PCR assay from nasopharyngeal swabs. The additive seasonal effects of outdoor temperatures and indoor relative humidity (RH) were evaluated. The 8-year average peak activity of human coronaviruses occurred in the first week of January, when droplet and contact transmission was enabled by the low indoor RH of 20\u201330%. Previous studies have shown that an increase in RH to 50% has been associated with markedly reduced viability and transmission of influenza virus and animal coronaviruses. As disease incidence was reduced by 50% in early March, to 75% in early April, to greater than 99% at the end of April, a relationship was observed from colder temperatures in January with a low indoor RH to a gradual increase in outdoor temperatures in April with an indoor RH of 45\u201350%. As a lipid-bound, enveloped virus with similar size characteristics to endemic human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 should be subject to the same dynamics of reduced viability and transmission with increased humidity. In addition to the major role of social distancing, the transition from lower to higher indoor RH with increasing outdoor temperatures could have an additive effect on the decrease in SARS-CoV-2 cases in May. Over the 8-year period of this study, human coronavirus activity was either zero or &gt; 99% reduction in the months of June through September, and the implication would be that SARS-Cov-2 may follow a similar pattern.","This study used statistically robust regression models to control for a large set of confounders (including county-level time-invariant factors and time trends, regional-level daily variation, state-level social distancing measures, ultraviolet light, and levels of ozone and fine particulate matter, PM2.5) to estimate a reliable rather than simple regression for the impact of weather on the most accurately measured outcome of COVID-19, death. When the average minimum temperature within a five-day window increased by one degree Fahrenheit in spring 2020, daily death rates in northern U.S. counties increased by an estimated 5.1%. When ozone concentration over a five-day window rose by one part per billion, daily death rates in southern U.S. counties declined by approximately 2.0%. Maximum temperature, precipitation, PM2.5, and ultraviolet light did not significantly associate with COVID-19 mortality. The mechanism that may drive the observed association of minimum temperature on COVID-19 deaths in spring months may be increased mobility and contacts. The effect of ozone may be related to its disinfectant properties, but this requires further confirmation.","Introduction Since its identification, the COVID-19 infection has caused substantial mortality and morbidity worldwide, but sub-Saharan Africa seems to defy the predictions. We aimed to verify this hypothesis using strong statistical methods.","Background &amp; objectives Association between serum vitamin D levels and lipid levels has been focus of research in recent times. The relationship of 25(OH)D and Atherogenic Index of Plasma is not well established among Indian population. We investigated the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, its relation with serum lipids and AIP among IT employees.","The Nurses\u2019 Health Study (NHS), Nurses\u2019 Health Study II (NHSII), Health Professionals Follow Up Study (HPFS) and the Physicians Health Study (PHS) have collected detailed longitudinal data on multiple exposures and traits for approximately 310,000 study participants over the last 35 years. Over 160,000 study participants across the cohorts have donated a DNA sample and to date, 20,691 subjects have been genotyped as part of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of twelve primary outcomes. However, these studies utilized six different GWAS arrays making it difficult to conduct analyses of secondary phenotypes or share controls across studies. To allow for secondary analyses of these data, we have created three new datasets merged by platform family and performed imputation using a common reference panel, the 1,000 Genomes Phase I release. Here, we describe the methodology behind the data merging and imputation and present imputation quality statistics and association results from two GWAS of secondary phenotypes (body mass index (BMI) and venous thromboembolism (VTE)).","A subset of boys with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) develop inflammatory demyelinating brain lesions. Risk factors are largely undefined. We used two independent cohorts to assess whether low vitamin D status predicts lesion development. In our first cohort, we measured 25-hydroxyvitamin D in 53 plasma samples from 20 pre-lesional ALD boys followed at two centers; half subsequently developed lesions. In our second cohort, we measured latitude (using home ZIP code) among 230 ALD boys in a database of 51 US pediatric hospitals; over half developed lesions. In regression models, low plasma vitamin D and northerly latitudes independently predicted ALD brain lesions.","Context Vaccination against Sars-Cov-2 is in full swing during COVID-19 pandemic. One of the efficient methods to evaluate response to vaccination is the assessment of humoral immunity by measuring Sars-Cov-2 antibody titer. Identification of factors that affect the humoral response is important so as to ameliorate the responses to vaccination or identify vulnerable groups that may need vaccination boosters.","Objective To determine the clinical outcomes of older COVID-19 patients who received DMB compared to those who did not. We hypothesized that fewer patients administered DMB would require oxygen therapy and/or intensive care support than those who did not.","Background Many nutrients have powerful immunomodulatory actions with the potential to alter susceptibility to COVID-19 infection, progression to symptoms, likelihood of severe disease and survival. The pandemic has fostered many nutrition-related theories, sometimes backed by a biased interpretation of evidence.","Background Critical care and sepsis remain high priority concerns in children. Observational studies report high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and present mixed results regarding the correlation between vitamin D status and adverse outcomes. Associations between deficiency and mortality, particularly in children with sepsis, remain unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to address this uncertainty.","Background and Aim Vitamin D3 (i.e. cholecalciferol) produces an active metabolite 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (i.e. 25(OH)D3) to promote intestinal calcium absorption. Given high population heterogeneity in 25(OH)D3 plasma concentration profiles, vitamin D3 dose regimen needs to be personalised. The objective of this study is to establish a model that accurately predicts 25(OH)D3 pharmacokinetics (PK) on an individual level to enable selection of an appropriate dose regimen for anyone.","Microgliosis is a prominent pathological feature in many neurological diseases including multiple sclerosis (MS). The precise role of microglia during demyelination, and the relative contributions of microglia vs. peripheral macrophages, are incompletely understood. Here, using a genetic fate mapping strategy, we identify microglia as predominant responders and key effectors of demyelination in the cuprizone (CUP) model. Pharmacological depletion of microglia demonstrates these cells are necessary for the demyelination, loss of oligodendrocytes, and reactive astrocytosis normally evident in this model. Electron microscopy (EM) and serial block face imaging show myelin sheaths remain intact in CUP treated mice depleted of microglia. However, these damaged myelin sheaths are lost upon-repopulation of microglia. Injection of colony-stimulating factor-1 to drive focal microgliosis in white matter is sufficient to induce focal demyelination in vivo. These studies indicate activated microglia are required for demyelination that results from primary myelin pathology and are sufficient to induce demyelination directly.","This work details the study of critical containment zones in Maharashtra within a time (April 9 2020 - July 31 2020) in the context of COVID-19. The effects of lockdown implementation, community isolation, environmental factors, demographic aspects, behavioural factors, diet etc. have been investigated. The effect of the aforementioned factors on the infected cases, cumulative infected cases, recoveries, cumulative recoveries, active cases, deaths and cumulative deaths are analyzed. The integrated effects of the aforementioned factors on COVID-19 outcomes are further amplified due to adequate and inadequate health facilities. The study will be helpful to scientists, researchers, pharmacists and biotechnologists in new vaccine design &amp; to accommodate above factors for the betterment of susceptible &amp; infected people of Maharashtra and similar demographies across the globe. Further, it pinpoints the need for more awareness and control strategies among the people to reduce the havoc, stress, fear, anxiety, pathogenicity and thereby reducing mortality.","The present study was conducted to assess the behavioral preventive measures and the use of medicines and herbal foods/products among the public in response to Covid-19. A cross-sectional survey was conducted from 27 June to 20 July 2020, and 1222 people participated. Kruskal-Wallis test was used to identify the differences in behavioral preventive practices across different demographic categories. To identify the factors associated with the use of preventive medicines and herbal foods/products, multivariable logistic regression was performed. Most participants adopted the recommended preventive practices such as washing hands more frequently (87.5%), staying home more often (85.5%), avoiding crowds (86%), and wearing masks (91.6%). About half of the smokers reported a decreased rate of smoking during the pandemic. Also, 14.8% and 57.6% of the participants took medicines and herbal foods/products as preventive measures against Covid-19. Arsenicum album and Zinc supplements were the most commonly used preventive medicines. Gender, age, and fear of Covid-19 were significantly associated with the use of both preventive medicines and herbal products. For the management of Covid-19 related symptoms, Paracetamols, Fexofenadine, and Zinc supplements were used most often. Most participants sought information from non-medical sources while using medicines and herbal products. Moreover, potentially inappropriate and unnecessary use of drugs were identified.","The most reliable predictor of future fracture risk is a previous fracture of any kind. The etiology of this increased fracture risk is not fully known, but it is possible that fracture initiates systemic bone loss leading to greater fracture risk at all skeletal sites. In this study we investigated systemic bone loss and recovery following femoral fracture in young (3 month old) and middle-aged (12 month old) mice. Transverse femur fractures were created using a controlled impact, and whole-body bone mineral density (BMD), trabecular and cortical microstructure, bone mechanical properties, bone formation and resorption rates, mouse voluntary movement, and systemic inflammation were quantified at multiple time points post-fracture. We found that fracture led to decreased whole-body BMD in both young and middle-aged mice 2 weeks post-fracture; this bone loss was recovered by 6 weeks in young, but not middle-aged mice. Similarly, trabecular bone volume fraction (BV/TV) of the L5 vertebral body was significantly reduced in fractured mice relative to control mice 2 weeks post-fracture (\u221211% for young mice, \u221218% for middle-aged mice); this bone loss was fully recovered by 6 weeks post-fracture in young mice. At 3 days post-fracture we observed significant increases in serum levels of interleukin-6 and significant decreases in voluntary movement in fractured mice compared to control mice, with considerably greater changes in middle-aged mice than in young mice. At this time point we also observed increased osteoclast number on L5 vertebral body trabecular bone of fractured mice compared to control mice. These data show that systemic bone loss occurs after fracture in both young and middle-aged mice, and recovery from this bone loss may vary with age. This systemic response could contribute to increased future fracture risk following fracture, and these data may inform clinical treatment of fractures with respect to improving long-term skeletal health.","Objectives Reports early in the epidemic linking low mean national Vitamin D level with increased COVID-19 death, and until recently little research on the impact of Vitamin D deficiency on severity of COVID-19, led to this update of the initial report studying mortality up to the end of January 2021.","Since 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has devastated human civilization throughout the earth. The pandemic is returning in different waves because of constant changes in the genetic components of the virus. Had we been able to predict the nature and timing of these waves earlier, numerous lives could, in essence, have been saved. It is evident that the situation has spiraled out of control in several countries for want of proper preventive measures. In this article, we described a comprehensive mathematical approach to understand the nature of the pandemic waves. Also, we determined the probable timing of the third wave that will help the concerned government(s) to take the necessary steps to better prepare for the unforeseen situation.","Background Understanding the pathophysiology of respiratory failure (ARDS) in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients is of utmost importance for the development of therapeutic strategies and identification of risk factors. Since we observed clinical and histopathological similarities between COVID-19 and lung manifestations of connective tissue disease (CTD-ILD) in our clinical practice, aim of the present study is to analyze a possible role of autoimmunity in SARS-CoV-2-associated respiratory failure.","Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory disorder with autoimmune pathogenesis characterized by the immune system attacking the synovium. It is a clinically heterogeneous disease that affects approximately 1.2 million Americans and 20 million people worldwide. It is advantageous to diagnose RA before extensive erosion as treatments are more effective at early stages. RA treatments have made notable progress, yet a significant number of patients still fail to respond to current medication and most of these come with harmful side effects. While the mechanistic reason for such failure rates remains unknown, the cellular and molecular signatures in the synovial tissues of patients with RA are likely to play a role in the variable treatment response and heterogeneous clinical evolution. While blood-based criteria are currently employed for diagnostics and treatments. such serologic parameters do not necessarily reflect biological actions in the target tissue of the patient and are relatively nonspecific to RA. Synovial tissue-based biomarkers are especially attractive as they can provide a confirmed diagnosis for RA. The shortage of accurate synovial tissue-based identifiers for RA diagnosis encouraged this research. This study analyzed data from several gene expression studies for differentially expressed genes in donor synovial tissue. Bioinformatics tools were used to construct and analyse protein interaction networks. Analysis deduced that regulating hematopoietic stem cell migration could serve as a potential RA diagnostic. VAV1, CD3G, LCK, PTPN6, ITGB2, CXCL13, CD4, and IL7R are found to be previously unclassified, potential biomarkers.","Testosterone is a naturally occurring hormone that has been positively associated with lean mass and strength in males. Whether endogenous testosterone is related to lean mass and strength in females is unknown.","Hutchinson Gilford Progeria Syndrome is a premature aging disease caused by LMNA gene mutation and the production of a truncated lamin A protein \u201cprogerin\u201d that elicits cellular and organismal toxicity. Progerin accumulates in the vasculature, being especially toxic for vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). Patients\u2019 autopsies show that vessel stiffening, and aortic atherosclerosis is accompanied by VSMC depletion in the medial layer, altered extracellular matrix (ECM), and thickening of the adventitial layer. Mechanisms whereby progerin causes massive VSMC loss and vessel alterations remain poorly understood. Mature VSMC retain phenotypic plasticity and can switch to a synthetic/proliferative phenotype. Here we show that progerin expression in human and mouse VSMC causes a switch towards the synthetic/proliferative phenotype. This switch elicits some level of replication stress in normal cells, which is exacerbated in the presence of progerin, leading to telomere fragility, genomic instability, and ultimately VSMC death. Importantly, calcitriol prevents replication stress, telomere fragility, and genomic instability, reducing VSMC death. In addition, RNAseq analysis shows induction of a profibrotic and proinflammatory aging-associated secretory phenotype upon progerin expression in human primary VSMC. Our data suggest that phenotypic switch-induced replication stress might be an underlying cause of VSMC loss in progeria, which together with loss of contractile features and gain of profibrotic and proinflammatory signatures contribute to vascular stiffness in HGPS. Preventing the phenotypic switch-induced replication stress with compounds such as calcitriol might ameliorate CVD in HGPS patients.","OBJECTIVES: Despite mandatory fortification of milk and margarine, most Canadians have inadequate vitamin D intake and consequently poor vitamin D status, especially in the winter. Increasing vitamin D fortification is one possible strategy to address this inadequacy. The purpose of our study was to examine the modelled effect of increased vitamin D fortification on the prevalence of inadequacy and the percentage of intakes greater than the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) using different fortification scenarios. METHODS: Dietary intakes (24-h recall) from the 2004 Canadian Community Health Survey 2.2 (n=34,381) were used to model increased vitamin D levels in milk and the addition of vitamin D to cheese and yogurt at various levels to meet label claims of an \"excellent source\" based on the recommended dietary intakes. The Software for Intake Distribution Evaluation was used to estimate the prevalence of inadequacy and intakes &gt;UL RESULTS: Fortification of milk, yogurt and cheese at 6.75 ug (270 IU)/serving led to more than doubling of vitamin D intakes across all sex/age groups and a drop in the prevalence of dietary inadequacy from &gt;80% to &lt;50% in all groups. Furthermore, no intakes approached the UL under any fortification scenario in any sex/age group. CONCLUSION: There is a pressing need to improve vitamin D status among Canadians. Increasing vitamin D fortification of dairy products, consistent with their positioning in Canada's Food Guide, can lead to increased intake without a risk of excess. This is a population-wide public health strategy that should be given consideration in Canada. ","ZMIZ1 is a transcriptional coactivator that is related to members of the protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS) family. ZMIZ1 regulates the activity of various transcription factors including the androgen receptor, p53, and Smad3. ZMIZ1 also interacts with Notch1 and selectively regulates Notch1 target genes relevant for T cell development and leukemogenesis in mammals. Human ZMIZ1 is additionally characterized as a latitude-dependent autoimmune disease (LDAD) risk gene, as it is responsive to vitamin D and has been associated with at least eleven blood cell traits.","To investigate the relationship between BCG vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 by bioinformatic approach. Two datasets for Sars-CoV-2 infection group and BCG-vaccinated group were downloaded. Differentially Expressed Genes were identified. Gene ontology and pathways were functionally enriched, and networking was constructed in NetworkAnalyst. Lastly, correlation between post-BCG vaccination and COVID-19 transcriptome signatures were established. A total of 161 DEGs (113 upregulated DEGs and 48 downregulated genes) were identified in the Sars-CoV-2 group. In the pathway enrichment analysis, cross-reference of upregulated KEGG pathways in Sars-CoV-2 with downregulated counterparts in the BCG-vaccinated group, resulted in the intersection of 45 common pathways, accounting for 86.5% of SARS-CoV-2 upregulated pathways. Of these intersecting pathways, a vast majority were immune and inflammatory pathways with top significance in IL-17, TNF, NOD-like receptors, and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways. Our data suggests BCG-vaccination may incur a protective role in COVID-19 patients until a targeted vaccine is developed.","A total of 6,628 PUBMED-registered publications on the relationships between the effects of vaccination and the provision of micronutrients have been studied by methods of topological analysis of text data. In case of insufficient intake of certain micronutrients, the functioning of the acquired immunity is disrupted resulting in an imbalance of populations of T-cells CD4+/CD8+ and of B-lymphocytes. Nutritional supplements of folate, vitamins A, D and B12, which are recognized regulators of cell division, support a wide range of lymphocyte populations. Trace elements zinc, iron, selenium, manganese and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are also important for supporting the mechanisms of acquired immunity. The data presented show that a course intake of these micronutrients by patients planning vaccination can significantly improve its effectiveness. In particular, these micronutrients can increase the titers of antibodies to pathogens, and to reduce the percentage of patients who still contract infection after vaccination. Supplements of these micronutrients can also contribute to the safety of vaccination: to prevent malaise and, in the unfortunate case of contracting infection despite the vaccine, to reduce the severity of the course and the mortality from the corresponding infection.","Background Increased vitamin D levels, as reflected by 25OHD measurements, have been proposed to protect against COVID-19 disease based on in-vitro, observational, and ecological studies. However, vitamin D levels are associated with many confounding variables and thus associations described to date may not be causal. Vitamin D Mendelian randomization (MR) studies have provided results that are concordant with large-scale vitamin D randomized trials. Here, we used two-sample MR to assess evidence supporting a causal effect of circulating 25OHD levels on COVID-19 susceptibility and severity.","To investigate the origins and stages of vertebrate adaptive radiation, we reconstructed the spatial and temporal histories of genetic variants underlying major phenotypic axes of diversification from the genomes of 202 Caribbean pupfishes. Ancient standing variation from disparate spatial sources was reassembled into new combinations which are under strong selection for adaptation to novel trophic niches on only a single island throughout the Caribbean. This occurred in three stages: first, standing variation associated with feeding behavior swept, then standing variation regulating craniofacial development and pigmentation, and finally de novo variation for craniofacial development. Our results provide clear support for two longstanding hypotheses about adaptive radiation and demonstrate how ancient alleles maintained for millennia in distinct environmental refugia can be assembled into new adaptive combinations.","Antigen-specific therapies hold promise for treating autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis while avoiding the deleterious side effects of systemic immune suppression. In this study, an antigen-specific dual-sized microparticle (dMP) immunotherapy reversed hind limb paralysis when administered in mice with advanced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Treatment reduced central nervous system (CNS) immune cell infiltration, demyelination and inflammatory cytokine levels. Mechanistic insights using single-cell RNA sequencing showed that treatment impacted the MHC II antigen presentation pathway in dendritic cells, macrophages, B cells and microglia, not only in the draining lymph nodes, but strikingly also in the spinal cord. CD74 and cathepsin S were among the common genes downregulated in most antigen presenting cell (APC) clusters, with B cells also having numerous MHC II genes reduced. Efficacy of the treatment diminished when B cells were absent, suggesting their impact in this therapy, in concert with other immune populations. Activation and inflammation were reduced in both APCs and T cells. This promising antigen-specific therapeutic approach advantageously engaged essential components of both innate and adaptive autoimmune responses, and capably reversed paralysis in advanced EAE without the use of broad immunosuppressant.","Background One major micronutrient known to have a possible protective effect against COVID-19 disease is vitamin D. This systematic review sought to identify and synthesise available evidence to aid the understanding of the possible effect of vitamin D deficiency on COVID-19 status and health outcomes in COVID-19 patients.","Large-scale efforts like the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project have made tremendous progress in cataloging the genomic binding patterns of DNA-associated proteins (DAPs), such as transcription factors (TFs). However most chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses have focused on a few immortalized cell lines whose activities and physiology deviate in important ways from endogenous cells and tissues. Consequently, binding data from primary human tissue are essential to improving our understanding of in vivo gene regulation. Here we analyze ChIP-seq data for 20 DAPs assayed in two healthy human liver tissue samples, identifying more than 450,000 binding sites. We integrated binding data with transcriptome and phased whole genome data to investigate allelic DAP interactions and the impact of heterozygous sequence variation on the expression of neighboring genes. We find our tissue-based dataset demonstrates binding patterns more consistent with liver biology than cell lines, and describe uses of these data to better prioritize impactful non-coding variation. Collectively, our rich dataset offers novel insights into genome function in healthy liver tissue and provides a valuable research resource for assessing disease-related disruptions.","Much adaptive evolutionary change is underlain by mutational variation in regions of the genome that regulate gene expression rather than in the coding regions of the genes themselves. An understanding of the role of gene expression variation in facilitating local adaptation will be aided by an understanding of underlying regulatory networks. Here, we characterize the genetic architecture of gene expression variation in the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), an important model in the study of adaptive evolution. We collected transcriptomic and genomic data from 60 half-sib families using an expression microarray and genotyping-by-sequencing, and located QTL underlying the variation in gene expression (eQTL) in liver tissue using an interval mapping approach. We identified eQTL for several thousand expression traits. Expression was influenced by polymorphism in both cis and trans regulatory regions. Trans eQTL clustered into hotspots. We did not identify master transcriptional regulators in hotspot locations: rather, the presence of hotspots may be driven by complex interactions between multiple transcription factors. One observed hotspot co-located with a QTL recently found to underlie salinity tolerance in the threespine stickleback. However, most other observed hotspots did not co-locate with regions of the genome known to be involved in adaptive divergence between marine and freshwater habitats.","Background Cerebral malaria (CM) is a kind of serious neurological complication caused by the acute Plasmodium falciparum infection. About 300000 patients including children under 5 years old died from this disease every year. Even intravenous artesunate (Art) is employed as the most effictive drug in the treatment of CM, high incidence of death and neurological sequelae are still inevitable. Therefore, we assessed the combination of Art and tetramethylpyrazine (TMP), to treat experimental CM (ECM) in C57BL/6 mice infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA). A non-biased whole brain quantitative proteomic analysis was also conducted to get some insight of the mechanism of the combinational treatment.","Background Vitamin D supplements are widely prescribed to help reduce disease risk. However, this strategy is based on findings using conventional epidemiological methods which are prone to confounding and reverse causation.","Objectives Dietary supplements may provide nutrients of relevance to ameliorate SARS-CoV-2 infection, although scientific evidence to support a role is lacking. We investigate whether the regular use of dietary supplements can reduce the risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection in around 1.4M users of the COVID Symptom Study App who completed a supplement use questionnaire.","Background Bovine mastitis is a key disease restricting developing global dairy industry. Genomic wide association studies (GWAS) provided a convenient way to understand the biological basis of mastitis and better prevent or treat the disease. 2b-RADseq is a reduced-representation sequencing that offered a powerful method for genome-wide genetic marker development and genotyping. This study, GWAS using two-stage association analysis identified mastitis important genes\u2019 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in Chinese Holstein cows.","Background Sunlight has been hypothesized to play a role in variation in cardiovascular disease according to geographic latitude. Objectives To evaluate the plausibility of sunlight as a factor in populations\u2019 average cholesterol and blood pressure Methods We analyzed World Health Organization data including 180 or more countries\u2019 age-standardized average cholesterol, age-standardized mean systolic blood pressure (BP), and age-standardized prevalence of raised BP, by geographic latitude, over decades. We also performed analysis by ultraviolet B light (UVB) exposure. Results Mean cholesterol increases with the distance of a country from the Equator. This relationship has changed very little since 1980. Similarly, in 1975, mean systolic BP and prevalence of raised BP were higher in countries farther from the Equator. However, the relationship between latitude and BP has changed dramatically; by 2015, the opposite pattern was observed in women. Countries\u2019 average UVB exposure has a stable relationship with cholesterol over recent decades, but a changing relationship with BP. Conclusions Since sunlight exposure in a country is relatively fixed and its relationship with BP has changed dramatically in recent decades, countries\u2019 average sunlight exposure is an unlikely explanation for contemporary country-level variation in BP. However, our findings are consistent with a putative effect of sunlight on countries\u2019 average cholesterol, as well as a no longer detectable effect on BP decades ago. A parsimonious potential explanation for the relationship between light and cholesterol is that 7-dehydrocholesterol can be converted to cholesterol, or in the presence of ultraviolet light, can instead be converted to vitamin D.","Adverse effects of psychological stress on physical and mental health, especially in older age, are well documented. How perceived stress relates to the epigenetic clock measure, DNA methylation age acceleration (DNAmAA), is less well understood and existing studies reported inconsistent results.","Background India has recorded 66,333 deaths over 36 administrative regions placing India third in the world after the US and Brazil for COVID-19 deaths as of 2 September 2020. Studies indicate that south-west monsoon season plays a role in the dynamics of contagious diseases, which tend to peak post-monsoon season. Recent studies show that vitamin D and its primary source Ultraviolet-B radiation (UVB) may play a protective role in mitigating COVID-19 deaths. However, the combined roles of the monsoon season and UVB in COVID-19 in India are still unclear. In this observational study, we empirically study the respective roles of monsoon season and UVB, whilst further exploring, whether monsoon season negatively impacts the protective role of UVB in COVID-19 deaths in India.","Background Fall risk in the elderly is a major public health issue due to the injury-related consequences and the risk of associated long-term disability. However, the delivery of preventive interventions in usual clinical practice still represents a challenge.","Introduction Current evidence still does not support the role of vitamin B12 or vitamin D in age-associated cognitive impairment.","Vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of developing multiple sclerosis (MS) but there is uncertainty about what dose and form of vitamin D could improve the clinical course of MS. The mechanisms underlying the effects of vitamin D in MS are not clear. Vitamin D3 increases the rate of differentiation of primary oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), suggesting that it might help remyelination in addition to modulating the immune response. Here we analyzed the transcriptome of differentiating rat CG4 OPCs treated with vitamin D2 or with D3 at 24 h and 72 h following onset of differentiation. Differentiation alone changed the expression of about 10% of the genes at 72 h compared to 24 h. Vitamin D2 and D3 exerted different effects on gene expression, with D3 influencing 1,272 genes and D2 574 at 24 h. The expression of the vast majority of these genes was either not changed in differentiating cells not exposed to vitamin D or followed the same trajectory as the latter. D3-repressed genes were enriched for gene ontology categories including transcription factors and the Notch pathway, while D3-induced genes were enriched for the Ras pathway. These findings should help to identify mechanisms mediating D3 action in MS.","In this population-based cohort of 7530 adults, combined IgG/A/M anti-Spike titres measured after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination were predictive of protection against breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection. Discrimination was significantly improved by adjustment for factors influencing risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure including household overcrowding, public transport use, and visits to indoor public places.","Background The epidemiological literature reports inconsistent associations between consumption or circulating concentrations of micro-nutrients and breast cancer risk. We investigated associations between genetically determined concentrations of 11 micro-nutrients (beta-carotene, calcium, copper, folate, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, selenium, vitamin B6, vitamin B12 and zinc) and breast cancer risk using Mendelian randomization (MR).","Introduction Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and methionine synthase reductase (MTRR) are the key enzymes of the folate pathway, which involved in the DNA methylation. DNA methylation may affect the stability and integrity of DNA, that supposed to play a pivotal role in carcinogenesis. So, we aimed to investigate the association of MTHFR C677T and MTRR A66G gene polymorphisms with susceptibility to prostate cancer in North Indian population. We also performed meta-analyses of published literatures on these polymorphisms to evaluate their association with prostate cancer.","Objectives To investigate how the relationship between vitamin D and COVID-19 has been presented in traditional media sources (UK newspapers) and assess the level of misinformation associated with this issue by comparing newspaper article content to the evidence-based guidelines.","In this short report we present a preliminary assessment of the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D status (25(OH)D), body mass index (BMI), ethnicity and other lifestyle factors in the first-reported UK Biobank COVID-19 positive cases (n 580) compared with negative controls (n 723). The COVID-19 cases include those who have been treated as a hospital inpatient as well as those who have not, and are from England only. Mean (SD) for age was 57.5 (8.7) in positive cases and 57.9 (8.7) in negative controls.","","Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common cause for hospitalization associated with significant mortality and morbidity. Disorders of calcium metabolism are a frequently encountered medical problem. The effect of hypocalcemia is not well defined on the outcomes of patients with PE. We aimed to identify the prognostic value of hypocalcemia in hospitalized PE patients utilizing the 2017 Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS). In this retrospective study, we selected patients with a primary diagnosis of Acute PE using ICD 10 codes. They were further stratified based on the presence of hypocalcemia. We primarily aimed to compare in-hospital mortality for PE patients with and without hypocalcemia. In the 2017 NIS, 187,989 patients had a principal diagnosis of acute PE. Among the above study group, 1565(0.8%)had an additional diagnosis of hypocalcemia. 12.4% of PE patients with hypocalcemia died in the hospital in comparison to 2.95% without hypocalcemia. On multivariate regression analysis, PE and hypocalcemia patients had 4 times higher odds (aOR-4.03, 95% CI 2.78-5.84, p&lt;0.001) of in-hospital mortality compared to those with only PE. We observed a similarly high odds of mortality(aOR=4.4) on 1:1 propensity-matched analysis. The incidence of acute kidney injury (aOR=2.62, CI 1.95-3.52, p&lt;0.001), acute respiratory failure (a0R=1.84, CI 1.42-2.38, p&lt;0.001), sepsis (aOR=4.99, CI 3.08-8.11, p&lt;0.001) and arrhythmias (aOR=2.63, CI 1.99-3.48, p&lt;0.001) were also higher for PE patients with hypocalcemia. Thus, PE patients with hypocalcemia have higher in-hospital complications and mortality than those without hypocalcemia.","Background In observational studies, 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentration has been associated with an increased risk of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, it remains unclear whether this association is causal.","Background Major risk factors of COVID-19 include older age, male gender, and comorbidities. In addition, host genetic makeup is also known to play a major role in COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. To assess the genetic predisposition of the Indian population to COVID-19, a comparative analysis of the frequencies of polymorphisms directly or potentially associated with COVID-19 susceptibility, severity, immune response, and fatal outcomes was done between the Indian population and other major populations (European, African, East Asian, South Asian, and American).","Less than 1% of the US population lives in long-term care facilities, yet this subset of the population accounts for 22% of total COVID-19 related deaths.1 Because of a lack of experimental evidence to treat COVID-19, analysis of real-world data to identify causal relationships between treatments/policies to mortality and morbidity among high-risk individuals is critical. We applied causal inference (CI) analysis to longitudinal patient-level health data of 4,091 long-term care high-risk patients with COVID-19 to determine if any actions or therapies delivered from January to August of 2020 reduced COVID-19 patient mortality rates during this period.","Background Vitamin D has numerous mechanistic roles within the immune system. There is increasing evidence to suggest Vitamin D deficiency may increase individuals\u2019 risk of COVID-19 infection and susceptibility. We aimed to determine the relationship between severity of vitamin D deficiency and sufficiency and COVID-19 infection within healthcare workers.","Treatment regimens for hyperbilirubinemia vary for very low birth weight infants. The present study seeks to determine whether the initiation of conservative phototherapy is as effective as aggressive phototherapy in reducing peak bilirubin levels without increasing adverse effects.","Recently, many epidemiological and animal studies have indicated that obesity have their origin in the early stages of life including the inappropriate balance of some nutrients, the objective of this study is to determine the risk of obesity in male mice offspring as a consequence of maternal VD deficiency-mediated disordering of the immune response. Four-week-old C57BL/6J female mice were fed VD-deficient or normal reproductive diets during pregnancy and lactation. Their male offspring were weighted and euthanized after being fed control and high-fat diets (HFD) for 16 weeks starting at the weaning. The serum was collected for biochemical analyses. Epididymal (eWAT) and inguinal (iWAT) white adipose tissues were excised for histological examination, immunohistochemistry, gene expressions of inflammatory factors, and for determining the proportions of immune cells by flow cytometry. Insufficient maternal VD intake exacerbated the development of obesity both in non-obese and obese male offspring as evidenced by larger adipose cells and abnormal glucose and lipid metabolisms. Also, the expression of proinflammatory cytokine genes was increased and that of anti-inflammatory cytokines was decreased in maternal VD-deficient groups in the eWAT and/or iWAT. This was accompanied by higher levels of TNF-\u03b1 or/and INF-\u03b2, and lower levels of IL-4 and IL-10. Insufficient maternal VD intake was also observed to induce a shift in the profiles of immune cells in the eWAT and/or iWAT, resulting in increased percentages of M1 macrophage, ATDCs, and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, but caused a significant decrease in the percentage of M2 macrophages, both in non-obese and obese male offspring. All these changes in the immune cell profile were more obvious in the eWAT than in the iWAT. These results indicated that insufficient maternal VD intake promoted the development of obesity in male offspring by modulating the immune cell populations and causing a polarization in the adipose depots.","Milk has rich nutritional content packed with fats, proteins and water. It also contains beneficiary and non-beneficiary microbes which account for its short shelf life. Currently cold storage, pasteurization, ultra-high temperature, microfiltration and addition of lactose peroxidase are the methods of choice to control milk spoilage and prolong its shelf life. Their limitations include high energy consumption and loss of variable proportion of heat sensitive nutrients. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticle coated thin film was used in food packaging industry for its antimicrobial property. TiO2 thin films were synthesized by sol gel process; it was characterized with scanning electron microscopy which showed pore size as 5 \u03bcm and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy which showed metal present in sample is TiO2, zinc and silver. Exposure of raw milk at room temperature to TiO2 thin films doped with zinc or copper for a couple of hours showed zone of inhibition in disc diffusion technique, reduction in acid production. It also showed reduction in optical density indicating inhibition of growth in growth curve analysis, increase in the time required for methylene blue reduction and a five log folds decrease in bacterial count estimated using serial dilution plate count. The present studies were carried out under room temperature and pressure which is an added advantage in terms of energy as well as retention of nutrients. Though TiO2 is insoluble in water one needs to address it toxicity issues and adverse effects if any on the nutritional quality of milk before scaling up the process.","Background The epidemiology of the Coronavirus-disease associated mucormycosis (CAM) syndemic is poorly elucidated. We aimed to identify risk factors that may explain the burden of cases and help develop preventive strategies.","BNIP3 is a BH3 only protein with both pro-apoptotic and pro-survival roles depending on the cellular context. It remains unclear how BNIP3 RNA level dictates cell fate decisions of cancer cells. Here we undertook a quantitative analysis of BNIP3 expression and functions in single cell datasets of various epithelial malignancies. Our results demonstrated that BNIP3 upregulation characterizes cancer cell subpopulations with increased fitness and proliferation. We further validated the upregulation of BNIP3 in liver cancer organoids compared with 2D culture. Taken together, the combination of in silico perturbations using public single cell datasets and experimental cancer modeling using organoids ushered in a new approach to address cancer heterogeneity.","Since the declaration of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, patients with migraine were specifically vulnerable to worsening of their headaches. Traditional medicine (TM) has been used to treat headache disorders for centuries, especially during times of a healthcare emergencies, similar to the current pandemic. We aimed to assess the use of TM in treatment of migraine amid COVID-19 pandemic in Kuwait, using an online, self-administered questionnaire. A total of 1018 patients completed the survey. TM was used by 39.9% respondents. The greatest users of TM were those with older age (p =0.04), and longer disease duration (p =0.005). TM users were found to be more compliant to treatments than non-TM users (p&lt;0.02). However, they reported significantly less communication with their physicians (p &lt;0.001) during the pandemic. This study showed higher rates of TM use, as a way of self-treatment, among patients with migraine during COVID-19 pandemic. Neurologists should prepare their patients with \u201crescue\u201d strategies for headache management, and new means of communication, to face these \u201cnew normal\u201d challenges.","Intronless genes (IGs) or single-exon genes lacking an intron are found across most Eukaryotes. Notably, IGs display a higher transcriptional fidelity as they are not regulated through alternative splicing, suggesting better predictability biomarkers and easier regulation as targets for therapy. Cancer is a complex disease that relies on progressive uncontrolled cell division linked with multiple dysfunctional biological processes. Tumor heterogeneity remains the most challenging feature in cancer diagnosis and treatment. Given the clinical relevance of IGs, we aim to identify their unique expression profiles and interactome, that may act as functional signatures across eight different cancers. We identified 940 protein-coding IGs in the human genome, of which about 35% were differentially expressed across the analyzed cancer datasets. Specifically, \u223c78% of differentially expressed IGs were undergoing transcriptional reprogramming with elevated expression in tumor cells. Remarkably, in all the studied tumors, a highly conserved induction of a group of deacetylase-histones located in a region of chromosome 6 enriched in nucleosome and chromatin condensation processes. This study highlights that differentially expressed human intronless genes across cancer types are prevalent in epigenetic regulatory roles participating in specific PPI networks for ESCA, GBM, and LUAD tumors. We determine that IGs play a key role in the tumor phenotype at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, with important mechanisms such as interactomics rewiring.","Background Vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased risk of multiple sclerosis (MS). However, its effect on the age of disease onset remains unclear. This study examines the relationship between serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels and age of first symptom onset among recently diagnosed MS patients.","Treatment of severe COVID-19 is currently limited by clinical heterogeneity and incomplete understanding of potentially druggable immune mediators of disease. To advance this, we present a comprehensive multi-omic blood atlas in patients with varying COVID-19 severity and compare with influenza, sepsis and healthy volunteers. We identify immune signatures and correlates of host response. Hallmarks of disease severity revealed cells, their inflammatory mediators and networks as potential therapeutic targets, including progenitor cells and specific myeloid and lymphocyte subsets, features of the immune repertoire, acute phase response, metabolism and coagulation. Persisting immune activation involving AP-1/p38MAPK was a specific feature of COVID-19. The plasma proteome enabled sub-phenotyping into patient clusters, predictive of severity and outcome. Tensor and matrix decomposition of the overall dataset revealed feature groupings linked with disease severity and specificity. Our systems-based integrative approach and blood atlas will inform future drug development, clinical trial design and personalised medicine approaches for COVID-19.","Impaired hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism are hallmarks of type\u20132 diabetes. Increased sulfide production from cysteine, or sulfide\u2013donor compounds, may beneficially regulate hepatic metabolism. Disposal of sulfide through the sulfide oxidation pathway (SOP) is critical for maintaining sulfide within a safe physiological range. We show that mice lacking the liver\u2013enriched mitochondrial SOP enzyme thiosulfate sulfur\u2013transferase (Tst\u2212/\u2212 mice) exhibit high circulating sulfide, increased gluconeogenesis, hypertriglyceridemia and fatty liver, despite whole\u2013body insulin\u2013sensitisation. Unexpectedly, hepatic sulfide levels were normal in Tst\u2212/\u2212 mice, a result of homeostatic induction of mitochondrial sulfide disposal and glutathione excretion associated with net suppression of protein persulfidation and nuclear respiratory factor\u20132 target proteins. Proteomic and persulfidomic profiling converged on gluconeogenesis and hepatic lipid metabolism and revealed a selective deficit in medium\u2013chain fatty acid oxidation in Tst\u2212/\u2212 mice. We reveal a critical role for TST in hepatic metabolism that raises implications for sulfide-donor strategies in the context of liver function and metabolic disease.","Localized non-inheritable developmental defects of tooth enamel (DDE) are classified as enamel hypoplasia (EH), opacity (OP) and post-eruptive breakdown (PEB) using the Enamel Defects Index. To better understand the etiology of DDE, and in particular possibly modifiable variables, we assessed the linkages amongst exposome variables during the specific time duration of the development of the DDE. In general, the human primary central maxillary incisor teeth develop between 13-14 weeks in utero and 3-4 weeks\u2019 postpartum of a full-term delivery, followed by tooth eruption at about 1 year of age. We utilized existing datasets of mother and child dyad data that encompassed 12 weeks\u2019 gestation through birth and early infancy, and child DDE outcomes from digital images of the erupted primary maxillary central incisor teeth. We applied a Bayesian modeling paradigm to assess the important predictors of EH, OP, and PEB. The results of Gibbs variable selection showed a key set of predictors: mother\u2019s pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI); maternal serum levels of calcium and phosphorus at gestational week 28; child\u2019s gestational age; and both mother\u2019s and child\u2019s functional vitamin D deficiency (FVDD). In this sample of healthy mothers and children, significant predictors for OP included the child having a gestational period &gt; 36 weeks and FVDD at birth, and for PEB included a mother\u2019s pre-pregnancy BMI &lt; 21.5 and higher serum phosphorus level at week 28.","IgE is the least abundant circulating antibody class but is constitutively present in healthy tissues bound to resident cells via its high-affinity receptor, Fc\u03b5RI. The physiological role of endogenous IgE is unclear but it is suggested to provide host protection against a variety of noxious environmental substances and parasitic infections at epithelial barrier surfaces. Here we show that skin inflammation enhances levels of IgE with natural specificities and with a similar repertoire, VDJ rearrangements and CDRH3 characteristics as in healthy tissue. IgE-bearing basophils are recruited to inflamed skin via CXCL12 and TSLP/IL-3-dependent upregulation of CXCR4. In the inflamed skin, IgE/Fc\u03b5RI-signalling in basophils promotes epithelial cell growth and differentiation, partly through histamine engagement of H1R and H4R. Furthermore, this natural IgE response strongly drives tumour outgrowth of epithelial cells harbouring oncogenic mutation. These findings indicate that natural IgE support skin barrier defences however during chronic tissue inflammation this may be subverted to promote tumour growth.","Clinical mastitis (CM) is an inflammatory disease occurring in the mammary glands of lactating cows. CM is under genetic control, and a prominent CM resistance QTL located on chromosome 6 was reported in various dairy cattle breeds. Nevertheless, the biological mechanism underpinning this QTL has been lacking. Herein, we mapped, fine-mapped, and discovered the putative causal variant underlying this CM resistance QTL in the Dutch dairy cattle population. We identified a ~12 kb multi-allelic copy number variant (CNV), that is in perfect linkage disequilibrium with a GWAS lead SNP, as a promising candidate variant. By implementing a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and through expression QTL mapping, we showed that the group-specific component gene (GC), a gene encoding a vitamin D binding protein, is an excellent candidate causal gene for the QTL. The multiplicated alleles are associated with increased GC expression and low CM resistance. Ample evidence from functional genomics data supports the presence of an enhancer within this CNV, which would exert cis-regulatory effect on GC. We observed that strong positive selection swept the region near the CNV, and haplotypes associated with the multiplicated allele were strongly selected for. Moreover, the multiplicated allele showed pleiotropic effects for increased milk yield and reduced fertility, hinting that a shared underlying biology for these effects may revolve around the vitamin D pathway. These findings together suggest a putative causal variant of a CM resistance QTL, where a cis-regulatory element located within a CNV can alter gene expression and affect multiple economically important traits.","Background We set out in this paper to compare Covid-19 results by country to better understand the factors leading to the differing results found internationally.","Human glial progenitor cells (hGPCs) can completely myelinate the brains of congenitally hypomyelinated shiverer mice, rescuing the phenotype and extending or normalizing the lifespan of these mice. We asked if implanted hGPCs might be similarly able to broadly disperse and remyelinate the diffusely and/or multicentrically-demyelinated adult CNS. In particular, we asked if fetal hGPCs could effectively remyelinate both congenitally hypomyelinated adult axons, and axons acutely demyelinated in adulthood, using adult shiverer mice and cuprizone-demyelinated mice, respectively. We found that hGPCs broadly infiltrate the adult CNS after callosal injection, and robustly myelinate congenitally-unmyelinated axons in adult shiverer. Moreover, implanted hGPCs similarly remyelinated denuded axons after cuprizone demyelination, whether they were delivered prior to or after initial cuprizone demyelination. Extraction and FACS of hGPCs from cuprizone-demyelinated brains in which they had been resident, followed by RNA-seq of the isolated human hGPCs, revealed their activation of transcriptional programs indicating their initiation of oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination. These data indicate the ability of transplanted hGPCs to disperse throughout the adult CNS, to myelinate dysmyelinated regions encountered during their parenchymal colonization, and to also be recruited as myelinating oligodendrocytes at later points in life, upon demyelination-associated demand.","At early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic which we are experiencing, the publicly reported incidence, mortality and case fatality rates (CFR) vary significantly between countries. Here we aim to untangle factors that are associated with the differences during the first quarter of the year 2020. Number of performed COVID-19 tests has a strong correlation with country-specific incidence (p &lt; 2 \u00d7 10\u221216) and mortality rate (p = 5.1 \u00d7 10\u22128). Using multivariate linear regression we show that incidence and mortality rates correlate significantly with GDP per capita (p = 2.6 \u00d7 10\u221215 and 7.0 \u00d7 10\u22124, respectively), country-specific duration of the outbreak (2.6 \u00d7 10\u22124 and 0.0019), fraction of citizens over 65 years old (p = 0.0049 and 3.8 \u00d7 10\u22124) and level of press freedom (p = 0.021 and 0.019) which cumulatively explain 80% of variability of incidence and more than 60% of variability of mortality of the disease during the period analyzed. Country hemisphere demonstrated significant correlation only with mortality (p = 0.17 and 0.036) whereas population density (p = 0.94 and p = 0.75) and latitude (p = 0.61 and 0.059) did not reach significance in our model. Case fatality rate is shown to rise as the outbreak progresses (p=0.028). We rank countries by COVID-19 mortality corrected for incidence and the factors that were shown to affect it, and by CFR corrected for outbreak duration, yielding very similar results. Among the countries where the outbreak started after the 15th of February and with at least 1000 registered patients during the period analyzed, the lowest corrected CFR are seen in Israel, South Africa and Chile. The ranking results should be considered with caution as they do not consider all confounding factors or data reporting biases.","Objective Diabetes is a known risk factor for mortality in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Our objective was to identify prevalence of hyperglycemia in COVID-19 patients with and without prior diabetes and quantify its association with COVID-19 disease course.","Background Every year, millions of people are hospitalized, and thousands die from influenza A virus (FLUAV) infection. Most cases of hospitalizations and death occur among elderly. Many of these elderly patients are reliant on medical treatment of underlying chronic diseases, such as arthritis, diabetes, and hypertension. We hypothesized that the commonly prescribed medicines for treatment of underlying chronic diseases can affect host responses to FLUAV infection, and thus contribute to morbidity and mortality associated with influenza. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine whether commonly prescribed medicines could affect host responses to virus infection in vitro.","Background Untreated sleep disorders have been linked with type 2 diabetes in previous evidence. This study was to investigate the correlation between serum 25(OH) vitamin D level and sleep quality in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes and reveal the therapeutic potential of 25(OH) vitamin D-based treatments to improve sleeping quality and its effect on diabetes management.","Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in adults and is associated with cognitive impairment. However, the mechanism by which adult vitamin D (AVD) deficiency affects cognitive function remains unclear. We examined spatial memory impairment in AVD-deficient BALB/c mice and its underlying mechanism by measuring spine density, long term potentiation (LTP), nitric oxide (NO), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and endothelial NOS (eNOS) in the hippocampus. Adult male BALB/c mice were fed a control or vitamin D deficient diet for 20 weeks. Spatial memory performance was measured using an active place avoidance (APA) task, where AVD-deficient mice had reduced latency entering the shock zone compared to controls. We characterised hippocampal spine morphology in the CA1 and dentate gyrus (DG) and made electrophysiological recordings in the hippocampus of behaviourally na\u00efve mice to measure LTP. We next measured NO, as well as glutathione, lipid peroxidation and oxidation of protein products and quantified hippocampal immunoreactivity for nNOS and eNOS. Spine morphology analysis revealed a significant reduction in the number of mushroom spines in the CA1 dendrites but not in the DG. There was no effect of diet on LTP. However, hippocampal NO levels were depleted whereas other oxidation markers were unaltered by AVD deficiency. We also showed a reduced nNOS, but not eNOS, immunoreactivity. Finally, vitamin D supplementation for 10 weeks to AVD-deficient mice restored nNOS immunoreactivity to that seen in in control mice. Our results suggest that lower levels of NO, reduced nNOS immunostaining contribute to hippocampal-dependent spatial learning deficits in AVD-deficient mice.","Background Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination vary for reasons that remain poorly understood.","A randomized controlled trial of calcifediol (25-hydroxyvitamin D3) as a treatment for hospitalized COVID-19 patients in C\u00f3rdoba, Spain, found that the treatment was associated with reduced ICU admissions with very large effect size and high statistical significance, but the study has had limited impact because it had only 76 patients and imperfect blinding, and did not measure vitamin D levels pre- and post-treatment or adjust for several comorbidities. Here we reanalyze the reported results of the study using rigorous and well established statistical techniques, and find that the randomization, large effect size, and high statistical significance address many of these concerns. We show that random assignment of patients to treatment and control groups is highly unlikely to distribute comorbidities or other prognostic indicators sufficiently unevenly to account for the large effect size. We also show that imperfect blinding would need to have had an implausibly large effect to account for the reported results. Finally, comparison with two additional randomized clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation for COVID-19 in India and Brazil indicates that early intervention and rapid absorption may be crucial for the observed benefits of vitamin D. We conclude that the C\u00f3rdoba study provides sufficient evidence to warrant immediate, well-designed pivotal clinical trials of early calcifediol administration in a broader cohort of inpatients and outpatients with COVID-19.","Co-option of transposable elements (TEs) to become part of existing or new enhancers is an important mechanism for evolution of gene regulation. However, contributions of lineage-specific TE insertions to recent regulatory adaptations remain poorly understood. Gibbons present a suitable model to study these contributions as they have evolved a lineage-specific TE called LAVA, which is still active in the gibbon genome. The LAVA retrotransposon is thought to have played a role in the emergence of the unusually rearranged structure of the gibbon genome by disrupting transcription of cell cycle genes. In this study, we investigated whether LAVA may have also contributed to the evolution of gene regulation by adopting enhancer function. We characterized fixed and polymorphic LAVA insertions across multiple gibbons and found 96 LAVA elements overlapping enhancer chromatin states. Moreover, LAVA was enriched in multiple transcription factor binding motifs, was bound by an important transcription factor (PU.1), and was associated with higher levels of gene expression in cis. We found gibbon-specific signatures of purifying/positive selection at 27 LAVA insertions. Two of these insertions were fixed in the gibbon lineage and overlapped with enhancer chromatin states, representing putative co-opted LAVA enhancers. These putative enhancers were located within genes encoding SETD2 and RAD9A, two proteins that facilitate accurate repair of DNA double-strand breaks and prevent chromosomal rearrangement mutations. Thus, LAVA\u2019s co-option in these genes may have influenced regulation of processes that preserve genome integrity. Our findings highlight the importance of considering lineage-specific TEs in studying evolution of novel gene regulatory elements.","Background Sepsis-induced metabolic dysfunction contributes to organ failure and death. L-carnitine has shown promise for septic shock, but a recent study demonstrated a non-significant reduction in mortality.","The mechanism of protection of the only approved tuberculosis (TB) vaccine, Bacillus Calmette Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) is poorly understood. In recent years, epigenetic modifications induced by BCG have been demonstrated to reflect a state of trained immunity. The concept of trained immunity is now explored as a potential prevention strategy for a variety of infections. Studies on human TB immunity are dominated by those using peripheral blood as surrogate markers for immunity. Here, we instead studied the lung compartment by obtaining induced sputum from subjects included in a TB contact tracing. CD3- and HLA-DR-positive cells were isolated from the collected sputum and DNA methylome analyses performed. Unsupervised cluster analysis revealed that DNA methylomes of cells from TB-exposed individuals and controls appeared as separate clusters, and the numerous genes that were differentially methylated were functionally connected. The enriched pathways were strongly correlated to previously reported epigenetic changes and trained immunity in immune cells exposed to the BCG vaccine in human and animal studies. We further demonstrated that similar pathways were epigenetically modified in human macrophages trained with BCG in vitro. Finally, we found evidence of an M. tuberculosis-triggered emergence of a non-macrophage cell population from BCG-trained macrophage cultures. These cells did not phagocytose M. tuberculosis, but \u2018corralled\u2019 the bacteria into focal points, resulting in limitation of bacterial growth. Altogether, our study demonstrates that similar epigenetic changes are induced by M. tuberculosis and BCG and suggests that the modifications promote transformation of macrophages (or an unknown progenitor) to establish a yet undescribed cellular defense mechanism which we term \u2018corralling\u2019, based on the metaphorical resemblance to sheepdog herding.","Variables responsible for the differential COVID-19 pandemic severity among countries remain undefined. Zinc, a micronutrient required for immunocompetence, is found deficient in populations. We hypothesized the differential COVID-19 severity observed among European countries could be associated with the Zn-deficiency prevalence. The COVID-19 data from different stages of pandemic, i.e., 8 April, 12 and 26 May 2020, were analyzed for covariation with the estimated Zn-deficiency. A significant, relatively stable, but negative correlation of Zn-deficiency with cases per million for the time period [r(20): -0.4930 to -0.5335, p-value: 0.02720 to 0.0154] and a steady improvement of covariation with deaths per million [r(20): -0.4056; p-value: 0.0760 on 26 May 2020] was observed. Considering, Zinc\u2019s key immunomodulatory role, widespread deficiency along with the self- and prescribed intervention in different target groups, e.g. children, women, elderly, carefully planned dedicated exploratory studies to understand the basis of the observed association are advisable.","Background The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of prolonged fasting (10 days) in the vitamin D, B12 levels, body mass index (BMI), weight, hemoglobin, vitality and quality of life (QoL) compared to normal diet.","We combined clinical, cytokine, genomic, methylation and dietary data from 43 young adult monozygotic twin pairs (aged 22 \u2013 36, 53% female), where 25 of the twin pairs were substantially weight discordant (delta BMI &gt; 3kg/ m2). These measurements were originally taken as part of the TwinFat study, a substudy of The Finnish Twin Cohort study. These five large multivariate data sets (comprising 42, 71, 1587, 1605 and 63 variables, respectively) were jointly analysed using an integrative machine learning method called Group Factor Analysis (GFA) to offer new hypotheses into the multi-molecular-level interactions associated with the development of obesity. New potential links between cytokines and weight gain are identified, as well as associations between dietary, inflammatory and epigenetic factors. This encouraging case study aims to enthuse the research community to boldly attempt new machine learning approaches which have the potential to yield novel and unintuitive hypotheses. The source code of the GFA method is publically available as the R package GFA.","Pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis (PAM) is an autosomal recessive lung disease caused by a deficiency in the pulmonary epithelial Npt2b sodium-phosphate co-transporter that results in accumulation of phosphate and formation of hydroxyapatite microliths in the alveolar space. The single cell transcriptomic analysis of a PAM lung explant showing a robust osteoclast gene signature in alveolar monocytes and the finding that calcium phosphate microliths contain a rich protein and lipid matrix that includes bone resorbing osteoclast enzymes suggested a role for osteoclast-like cells in the defense against microliths. While investigating the mechanisms of microlith clearance, we found that Npt2b modulates pulmonary phosphate homeostasis through effects on alternative phosphate transporter activity and alveolar osteoprotegerin, and that microliths induce osteoclast formation and activity in a receptor activator of nuclear factor-\u03baB ligand (RANKL) and dietary phosphate dependent manner. This work reveals that Npt2b and pulmonary osteoclast-like cells play key roles in pulmonary homeostasis and suggest potential new therapeutic targets for the treatment of lung disease.","Background and Objectives: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects \u223c20% of older adults and secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) is a common condition in these patients. Studies have linked HPT to a greater risk of fractures, vascular events and mortality. However, the optimal parathyroid hormone (PTH) level needed to minimize these events remains uncertain.","Metronomic chemotherapy (MET) has been developed to address the shortcomings of maximum-tolerated chemotherapy (MTD) in regard to toxicity and development of resistance mechanisms in the tumor. In colorectal cancer (CRC), MET is a promising novel strategy to treat locally advanced malignancies when used as neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). However, so far there are no preclinical studies to assess the impact of MET NAC in CRC to assess the benefits and challenges of this approach. Here, we used a primary model of CRC (via azoxymethane) to analyze longitudinal changes in angiogenesis in primary tumors under MET and MTD NAC using a combination of diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and mRNA expression (via qPCR). Our results show that MET and MTD NAC lead to increased mean tissue oxygen saturation (8% and 5%, respectively) and oxyhemoglobin (15% and 10%) between weeks 2 and 5 of NAC, and that such increases are caused by distinct molecular signatures in the angiogenic program. Specifically, we find that in the MET group there is a sustained increase in Hif-1a, Aldoa, and Pgk1 expression, suggesting upregulated glycolysis, whereas MTD NAC causes a significant reduction in the expression of the aforementioned genes and of Vegf, leading to vascular remodeling in MTD-treated tumors. Taken together, this study demonstrates the ability of combined optical and molecular methodologies to provide a holistic picture of tumor response to therapy in CRC in a minimally invasive manner.","Major life changing events such as the COVID-19 pandemic may have major impact on one's health and general well-being. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and predictive factors, including gender specific differences, of Complementary Medicine (CM) use (including CM consultations, self-care management and self-help techniques) during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 in the Netherlands. CM use was studied among a random representative sample (n = 1004) of the adult Dutch population using an online survey conducted from 22-27 May 2020. The survey included a modified version of I-CAM-Q and additional questions on demographic characteristics, reasons for CM use, perceived effectiveness and side effects. 68.0% of the participants reported to have used CM (CM consultations (13.3%), self-management strategies (59.4%), self-help techniques (30.0%)). Most frequently reported reason of CM use was to improve general well-being (61.6%), prevention and/or treatment of COVID-19 was only reported by 10%. Perceived effectiveness of CM was high and number of experienced side effects low. Being a women, worried to get infected with COVID-19, higher education and living in northern/ middle region of the Netherlands were predictive factors to use CM. In the Netherlands, specific groups (e.g. women/ highly educated) use CM, mainly to improve general wellbeing, and seem to benefit of it during the first months of the pandemic. The high perceived effectiveness and low reporting of side effects should encourage medical professionals and policy makers for more openness towards considering CM as being part of an integrative approach to public health in times life changing events occur.","The offering of grocery stores is a strong driver of consumer decisions, shaping their diet and long-term health. While processed food has been increasingly associated with unhealthy diet, information on the degree of processing characterising an item in a store is virtually impossible to obtain, limiting the ability of individuals to make informed choices. Here we introduce GroceryDB, a database with over 50,000 food items sold by Walmart, Target, and Wholefoods, unveiling the degree of processing characterizing each food. GroceryDB indicates that 73% of the US food supply is ultra-processed, and on average ultra-processed foods are 52% cheaper than minimally-processed alternatives. We find that the nutritional choices of the consumers, translated as the degree of food processing, strongly depend on the food categories and grocery stores. We show that there is no single nutrient or ingredient \u201cbio-marker\u201d for ultra-processed food, allowing us to quantify the individual contribution of over 1,000 ingredients to ultra-processing. GroceryDB and the associated http://TrueFood.Tech/ website make this information available, aiming to simultaneously empower the consumers to make healthy food choices, and aid policy makers to reform the food supply.","A number of clues point to a possible role of vitamin D in fighting COVID-19: a reduction in case growth speed with solar zenith angle, higher fatality rate in black people, lower fatality rate in populations that spend more time outdoors. Yet a direct demonstration that vitamin D deficiency is associated with COVID-19 fatalities has remained elusive. We show here in a comparison of 32 countries that countries with high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among elderly females show a confirmed case fatality rate twice as high as those with low prevalence. We then show that this effect cannot be explained by differences in life expectancy between countries. A mechanistic role for vitamin D in the severity of COVID-19 is proposed.","DNA methylation age (DNAm age, epigenetic clock) is a novel and promising biomarker of aging. It is calculated from the methylation fraction of specific cytosine phosphate guanine sites (CpG sites) of genomic DNA. Several groups have proposed epigenetic clock algorithms and these differ mostly regarding the number and location of the CpG sites considered and the method used to assess the methylation status. Most epigenetic clocks are based on a large number of CpGs, e.g. as measured by DNAm microarrays. We have recently evaluated an epigenetic clock based on the methylation fraction of seven CpGs that were determined by methylation-sensitive single nucleotide primer extension (MS-SNuPE). This method is more cost-effective when compared to array-based technologies as only a few CpGs need to be examined. However, there is only little data on the correspondence in epigenetic age estimation using the 7-CpG clock and other algorithms.","Objective Studies have demonstrated a potential link between low vitamin D levels and both an increased risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and poorer clinical outcomes but have not established temporality. This retrospective study examined if, and to what degree, a relationship exists between pre-infection serum vitamin D levels and disease severity and mortality of SARS-CoV-19.","Introduction Several Mendelian randomization studies have been conducted, which identified multiple risk factors for Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). However, they typically focus on a few pre-selected risk factors.","Expression levels of retinoic acid receptor gamma (NR1B3/RARG, encodes RAR\u03b3), are commonly reduced in prostate cancer (PCa). Therefore we sought to establish the cellular and gene regulatory consequences of reduced RAR\u03b3 expression, and determine RAR\u03b3 regulatory mechanisms. RARG shRNA approaches in non-malignant (RWPE-1 and HPr1-AR) and malignant (LNCaP) prostate models revealed that reducing RAR\u03b3 levels, rather than adding exogenous retinoid ligand, had the greatest impact on prostate cell viability and gene expression. ChIP-Seq defined the RAR\u03b3 cistrome which was significantly enriched at active enhancers associated with AR binding sites. Reflecting a significant genomic role for RAR\u03b3 to regulate androgen signaling, RAR\u03b3 knockdown in HPr1-AR cells significantly regulated the magnitude of the AR transcriptome. RAR\u03b3 down-regulation was explained by increased miR-96 in PCa cell and mouse models, and TCGA PCa cohorts. Biochemical approaches confirmed that miR-96 directly regulated RAR\u03b3 expression and function\uf02e Capture of the miR-96 targetome by biotin-miR96 identified that RAR\u03b3 and a number of RAR\u03b3 interacting co-factors including TACC1 were all targeted by miR-96, and expression of these genes were prominently altered, positively and negatively, in the TCGA-PRAD cohort. Differential gene expression analyses between tumors in the TCGA-PRAD cohort with lower quartile expression levels of RARG and TACC1 and upper quartile miR-96, compared to the reverse, identified a gene network including several RAR\u03b3 target genes (e.g. SOX15) that significantly associated with worse disease free survival (hazard ratio 2.23, 95% CI 1.58 to 2.88, p=0.015). In summary, miR-96 targets a RAR\u03b3 network to govern AR signaling, PCa progression and disease outcome.","COVID-19 is a severe respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, a novel human coronavirus. The host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is not clearly understood. Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibit heterogeneous intensity of symptoms, i.e., asymptomatic, mild, and severe. Moreover, effects on organs also vary from person to person. These heterogeneous responses pose pragmatic hurdles for implementing appropriate therapy and management of COVID-19 patients. Post-COVID complications pose another major challenge in managing the health of these patients. Thus, understanding the impact of disease severity at the molecular level is vital to delineate the precise host response and management. In the current study, we performed a comprehensive transcriptomics analysis of publicly available seven asymptomatic and eight severe COVID-19 patients. Exploratory data analysis using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed the distinct clusters of asymptomatic and severe patients. Subsequently, the differential gene expression analysis using DESeq2 identified 1,224 significantly upregulated genes (logFC&gt;= 1.5, p-adjusted value &lt;0.05) and 268 significantly downregulated genes (logFC&lt;= -1.5, p-adjusted value &lt;0.05) in severe samples in comparison to asymptomatic samples. Eventually, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of upregulated genes revealed significant enrichment of terms, i.e., anti-viral and anti-inflammatory pathways, secondary infections, Iron homeostasis, anemia, cardiac-related, etc. Gene set enrichment analysis of downregulated genes indicates lipid metabolism, adaptive immune response, translation, recurrent respiratory infections, heme-biosynthetic pathways, etc. In summary, severe COVID-19 patients are more susceptible to other health issues/concerns, non-viral pathogenic infections, atherosclerosis, autoinflammatory diseases, anemia, male infertility, etc. And eventually, these findings provide insight into the precise therapeutic management of severe COVID-19 patients and efficient disease management.","Background COVID-19 is a major worldwide health problem because of acute respiratory distress syndrome, and mortality. Several lines of evidence have suggested a relationship between the vitamin D endocrine system and severity of COVID-19.","","Characterization of ancestry-linked peptide variants in disease-relevant patient tissues represents a foundational step to connect patient ancestry with molecular disease pathogenesis. Nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) encoding missense substitutions within tryptic peptides exhibiting high allele frequencies in European, African, and East Asian populations, termed peptide ancestry informative markers (pAIMs), were prioritized from 1000 genomes. In silico analysis shows that as few as 20 pAIMs can determine ancestry proportions similarly to &gt;260K SNPs (R2=0.9905). Multiplexed proteomic analysis of &gt;100 human endometrial cancer cell lines and uterine leiomyoma tissues resulted in the quantitation of 62 pAIMs that correlate with self-described race and genotype-confirmed patient ancestry. Candidates include a D451E substitution in GC vitamin D-binding protein previously associated with altered vitamin D levels in African and European populations. These efforts describe a generalized set of markers for proteoancestry assessment that will further support studies investigating the impact of ancestry on the human proteome and how this relates to the pathogenesis of uterine neoplasms.","  Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused global disruption and a\nsignificant loss of life. Existing treatments that can be repurposed as\nprophylactic and therapeutic agents could reduce the pandemic's devastation.\nEmerging evidence of potential applications in other therapeutic contexts has\nled to the investigation of dietary supplements and nutraceuticals for\nCOVID-19. Such products include vitamin C, vitamin D, omega 3 polyunsaturated\nfatty acids, probiotics, and zinc, all of which are currently under clinical\ninvestigation. In this review, we critically appraise the evidence surrounding\ndietary supplements and nutraceuticals for the prophylaxis and treatment of\nCOVID-19. Overall, further study is required before evidence-based\nrecommendations can be formulated, but nutritional status plays a significant\nrole in patient outcomes, and these products could help alleviate deficiencies.\nFor example, evidence indicates that vitamin D deficiency may be associated\nwith greater incidence of infection and severity of COVID-19, suggesting that\nvitamin D supplementation may hold prophylactic or therapeutic value. A growing\nnumber of scientific organizations are now considering recommending vitamin D\nsupplementation to those at high risk of COVID-19. Because research in vitamin\nD and other nutraceuticals and supplements is preliminary, here we evaluate the\nextent to which these nutraceutical and dietary supplements hold potential in\nthe COVID-19 crisis.\n","","Background The mechanisms linking UV radiation and vitamin D exposure to the risk of acquiring the latitude and critical period dependent autoimmune disease, multiple sclerosis, is unclear. We examined the effect of vitamin D on DNA methylation as well as DNA methylation at vitamin D receptor binding sites in adult and paediatric myeloid cells.","Individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus experience high rates of influenza virus infection and complications. We compared the magnitude and duration of serologic response to trivalent influenza vaccine in adults aged 50-80 with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus. Serologic response to influenza vaccination was similar in both groups: greater fold-increases in antibody titer occurred among individuals with lower pre-vaccination antibody titers. Waning of antibody titers was not influenced by diabetes status.","Background and objectives Patients with undiagnosed CKD are at increased risk of suboptimal dialysis initiation and therefore reduced access to home dialysis and transplantation as well as poor outcomes. Improved understanding of how patients remain undiagnosed is important to determine better intervention strategies.","Objective To investigate the associations of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) variability measures with new onset heart failure, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with a populational-cohort study.","Background \nBlood plasma proteins are modifiable and have been associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), but understanding which proteins are on the causal pathway remains challenging.","Objective The COVID-19 pandemic was accompanied by varying movement restriction measures across populations worldwide. These restrictions altered daily activities at all levels, including food access and intake, as well as psychological feelings during lockdown. The main objective of the present study was to evaluate health, and nutrition behaviors during confinement during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Genetic risk scores (GRSs) are weighted sums of risk allele counts of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with a disease or trait. Construction of GRSs is typically based on published results from Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWASs), the majority of which have been performed in large populations of European ancestry (EA) individuals. While many genotype-trait associations have been shown to generalize from EA populations to other populations, such as Hispanics/Latinos, the optimal choice of SNPs and weights for GRSs may differ between populations due to different linkage disequilibrium (LD) and allele frequency patterns. This is further complicated by the fact that different Hispanic/Latino populations may have different admixture patterns, so that LD and allele frequency patterns may not be the same among non-EA populations. Here, we compare various approaches for GRS construction, using GWAS results from both large EA studies and a smaller study in Hispanics/Latinos, the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL, n = 12, 803). We consider multiple ways to select SNPs from association regions and to calculate the SNP weights. We study the performance of the resulting GRSs in an independent study of Hispanics/Latinos from the Woman Health Initiative (WHI, n = 3, 582). We support our investigation with simulation studies of potential genetic architectures in a single locus. We observed that selecting variants based on EA GWASs generally performs well, as long as SNP weights are calculated using Hispanics/Latinos GWASs, or using the meta-analysis of EA and Hispanics/Latinos GWASs. The optimal approach depends on the genetic architecture of the trait.","Osteoporosis, the most common bone disease, is characterized by a low bone mass and increased risk of fractures. Importantly, individuals with the same bone mineral density (BMD), as measured on two dimensional (2D) radiographs, have different risks for fracture, suggesting that microstructural architecture is an important determinant of skeletal strength. Here we took advantage of the rich phenotypic and genetic diversity of the Collaborative Cross (CC) mice. Using microcomputed tomography, we examined key structural parameters in the femoral cortical and trabecular compartments of male and female mice from 34 CC lines. These traits included the trabecular bone volume fraction, number, thickness, connectivity, and spacing, as well as structural morphometric index. In the mid-diaphyseal cortex, we recorded cortical thickness and volumetric BMD.","Background In vitro, animal model, and clinical evidence suggests that tuberculosis is not a monomorphic disease, and that host response to tuberculosis is protean with multiple distinct molecular pathways and pathologies (endotypes). We applied unbiased clustering to identify separate tuberculosis endotypes with classifiable gene expression patterns and clinical outcomes.","Background COVID-19 pandemic mitigation requires evidence-based strategies. Because COVID-19 can spread via respired droplets, most US states mandated mask use in public settings. Randomized control trials have not clearly demonstrated mask efficacy against respiratory viruses, and observational studies conflict on whether mask use predicts lower infection rates. We hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use were associated with lower COVID-19 case growth rates in the United States.","Graphical Abstract ","Background Multiple sclerosis (MS) disease risk is associated with reduced sun exposure. This study assessed the relationship between measures of sun-exposure (vitamin D (vitD), latitude) and MS disease severity, the mechanisms of action, and effect-modification by medication and sun-sensitivity associated MC1R variants.","Background Despite the observed associations between psychiatric disorders and nutrient intake, genetic studies are limited.","Animal and plant protein sources have contrasting relationships with nutrient adequacy and long-term health, and their adequate ratio is highly debated. Using reference values for nutrients and disease burden risks for foods, we modeled diets with graded plant protein proportions (%PP) that ensure nutrient adequacy, minimize long-term health risks and best preserve dietary habits in French adults. We furthermore estimated the diets related environmental impacts. We demonstrated that nutrient-adequate diets must fall within the 15%-80% %PP range, and that fully healthy diets additionally achieving the minimum-risk exposure levels for unhealthy/healthy foods must fall within the 25%-70% %PP range. All healthy diets were very distant from current typical diet, and those with higher %PP contributed less to climate change and land use. There is thus no single optimal %PP when considering only nutrition and health, but high %PP diets are more sustainable. For %PP&gt;80%, nutrient fortification/supplementation and/or new foods are required.","Objective Vitamin D status has been linked to risk of inflammatory brain lesions. We sought to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of oral vitamin D dosing regimens in boys with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD).","Background The COVID-19 pandemic goes along with increased mortality from acute respiratory disease, and measures to limit the spread of the infection go along with increased risk of vitamin D deficiency, especially among high risk groups. It has been suggested that vitamin D3 supplementation might help to reduce respiratory disease mortality.","Survivors of childhood cancer treated with radiation therapy (RT) and osteotoxic chemotherapies are at increased risk for fractures. However, research focusing on how genetic and clinical susceptibility factors jointly contribute to fracture risk among long-term (\u22655 years) survivors of childhood cancer has been limited. To address this gap, we conducted genome-wide association studies of fracture risk in 2,453 participants from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) using Cox regression models and prioritized sex- and treatment-stratified genetic associations. Replication analyses were conducted in an independent survivor sample from the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study (SJLIFE). We identified a genome-wide significant (P&lt;5\u2a2f10\u22128) fracture risk locus, 16p13.3 (HAGHL), among female CCSS survivors (N=1,289) with strong evidence of sex-specific effects (Psex-heterogeneity&lt;7\u2a2f10\u22126). We found rs1406815 showed the strongest association with fracture risk after replication (HRmeta-analysis per risk allele=1.43, P=8.2\u2a2f10\u22129; N=1,935 women). While the association between rs1406815 and fracture risk was weak among female survivors who did not receive radiation therapy (RT) (HRCCSS=1.22, P=0.11), the association strength increased with greater RT doses to the head or neck (HRCCSS=1.88, P=2.4\u2a2f10\u221210 in those with any head/neck RT; HRCCSS=3.79, P=9.1\u2a2f10\u22127 in those treated with &gt;36 Gray). In silico bioinformatics analyses suggest these fracture risk alleles regulate HAGHL gene expression and related bone resorption pathways, and are plausibly moderated by head/neck RT. Genetic risk profiles integrating this locus may help identify young female survivors who would benefit from targeted interventions to reduce fracture risk.","Purpose The Westlake BioBank for Chinese (WBBC) pilot cohort is a population-based prospective study with its major purpose to better understand the effect of genetic and environmental factors on growth and development from adolescents to adults. The dataset comprises a wide range of demographics, anthropometric measures, physical activity, sleep quality, age at menarche and bone mineral density.","Proximal genetic variants are frequently correlated, implying that also the corresponding effect sizes detected by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are not independent. There are already methods taking this into account when aggregating effects from a single GWAS across genes or pathways. Here we present a rigorous, yet fast method for detecting genes with coherent association signals for two traits, facilitating cross-GWAS analyses. To this end we devised a new significance test for covariance of datapoints not drawn independently, but with known inter-sample covariance structure. We show that the distribution of its test statistic is a linear combination of \u03c72 distributions, with positive and negative coefficients. The corresponding cumulative distribution function can be efficiently calculated with Davies\u2019 algorithm at high precision. We apply this general framework to test for dependence between SNP-wise effect sizes of two GWAS at the level of genes. We extend this test to detect also gene-wise causal links. We demonstrate the utility of our method by uncovering potential shared genetic links between severity of COVID-19 and (1) being prescribed class M05B medication (drugs affecting bone structure and mineralization), (2) rheumatoid arthritis, (3) vitamin D (25OHD), and (4) serum calcium concentrations. Our method detects a potential role played by chemokine receptor genes linked to TH1 versus TH2 immune reaction, a gene related to integrin beta-1 cell surface expression, and other genes potentially impacting severity of COVID-19. Our approach will be useful for similar analyses involving data-points with known auto-correlation structures.","Background SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing the Covid-19 pandemic emerged in December 2019 in China and raised fears that it could overwhelm healthcare systems worldwide. In June 2020, all African countries registered human infections with SARS-CoV-2.","Substantial advances have been made in identifying genetic contributions to depression, but little is known about how the effect of genes can be modulated by the environment, creating a gene-environment interaction. Using multivariate reaction norm models (MRNMs) within the UK Biobank (N=61294-91644), we investigate whether the polygenic and residual variation of depressive symptoms are modulated by 25 a-priori selected covariate traits: 12 environmental variables, 5 biomarkers and polygenic risk scores for 8 mental health disorders. MRNMs provide unbiased polygenic-covariate interaction estimates for a quantitative trait by controlling for outcome-covariate correlations and residual-covariate interactions. Of the 25 selected covariates, 11 significantly modulate depressive symptoms, but no single interaction explains a large proportion of phenotypic variation. Results are dominated by residual-covariate interactions, suggesting that covariate traits (including neuroticism, childhood trauma and BMI) typically interact with unmodelled variables, rather than a genome-wide polygenic score, to influence depressive symptoms. Only average sleep duration has a polygenic-covariate interaction explaining a demonstrably non-zero proportion of the variability in depressive symptoms. This effect is small, accounting for only 1.22% (95% CI [0.54,1.89]) of variation. The presence of an interaction highlights a specific focus for intervention, but the negative results here indicate a limited contribution from polygenic-environment interactions.","Background: Prognostic markers for COVID-19 disease outcome are currently lacking. Plasma gelsolin (pGSN) is an actin-binding protein and an innate immune marker involved in disease pathogenesis and viral infections. Here, we demonstrate the utility of pGSN as a prognostic marker for COVID-19 disease outcome; a test performance that is significantly improved when combined with cytokines and antibodies compared to other conventional markers such as CRP and ferritin. \nMethods: Blood samples were longitudinally collected from hospitalized COVID-19 patients as well as COVID-19 negative controls and the levels of pGSN in ug/mL, cytokines and anti- SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibodies assayed. Mean values were correlated with clinical parameters to develop a prognostic platform. \nResults: pGSN levels were significantly reduced in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy individuals. Additionally, pGSN levels combined with plasma IL-6, IP-10 and M-CSF significantly distinguished COVID-19 patients from healthy individuals. While pGSN and anti-spike IgG titers together strongly predict COVID-19 severity and death, the combination of pGSN and IL-6 was a significant predictor of milder disease and favorable outcomes. \nConclusion: Taken together, these findings suggest that multi-parameter analysis of pGSN, cytokines and antibodies could predict COVID-19 hospitalization outcomes with greater certainty compared with conventional clinical laboratory markers such as CRP and ferritin. This research will inform and improve clinical management and health system interventions in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Type 2 diabetes is caused by an imbalanced supply and demand of insulin. Insulin resistance and impaired \u03b2-cell function contribute to the onset of hyperglycemia. No single treatment modality can affect both aspects of diabetes pathophysiology. Thus, current treatments focus either on increasing insulin secretion (incretin mimetics, sulfonylureas) or insulin sensitivity (metformin and TZD), or reducing hyperglycemia (insulin, sglt2i). Previously, we reported that ablation of Gc, encoding a secreted protein with a primary role in vitamin D transport, improves pancreatic \u03b2-cell function in models of diet-induced insulin resistance. Here, we show that Gc ablation has systemic insulin-sensitizing effects to prevent weight gain, hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance, and lower NEFA and triglyceride in mice fed a high-fat diet. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps show that Gc ablation protects insulin\u2019s ability to reduce hepatic glucose production, and increases glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Moreover, acute Gc inhibition by way of adeno-associated virus encoding a short hairpin RNA to promote Gc mRNA degradation, prevents glucose intolerance caused by high fat feeding. The data suggest that Gc inhibition can provide an approach to increase insulin production in \u03b2-cells, and insulin action in peripheral tissues.","In individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD), Black and South Asian ethnic groups are twice as likely to have severe COVID-19 compared to White participants, whilst the most socially deprived groups are at a 50-60% increased risk of severe COVID-19.","SARS-CoV-2 causes remarkably variable disease from asymptomatic individuals to respiratory insufficiency and coagulopathy. Vitamin K deficiency was recently found to associate with clinical outcome in a cohort of COVID-19 patients. Vitamin D has been hypothesized to reduce disease susceptibility by modulating inflammation, yet little is known about its role in disease severity. Considering the critical interaction between vitamin K and vitamin D in calcium and elastic fiber metabolism, we determined vitamin D status in the same cohort of 135 hospitalized COVID-19 patients by measuring blood 25(OH)D levels. We found no difference in vitamin D status between those with good and poor outcome (defined as intubation and/or death). Instead, we found vitamin D sufficient persons (25(OH)D &gt;50 nmol/L) had accelerated elastic fiber degradation compared to those with mild deficiency (25(OH)D 25-50 nmol/L). Based on these findings, we hypothesize that vitamin D might have both favorable anti-inflammatory and unfavorable pro-calcification effects during COVID-19 and that vitamin K might compensate for the latter.","Background Vitamin D is a fundamental regulator of host defences by activating genes related to innate and adaptive immunity. Previous research shows a correlation between the levels of vitamin D in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the degree of disease severity. This work investigates the impact of the genetic background related to vitamin D pathways on COVID-19 severity. For the first time, the Portuguese population was characterized regarding the prevalence of high impact variants in genes associated with the vitamin D pathways.","Background Hansen\u2019s disease (HD) is endemic in Brazil, a country with the third highest number of COVID-19 cases in the world and the second highest number of COVID-19 deaths. COVID-19 in persons affected by HD has not been described at population level in this country.","Background Vitamin D exerts regulatory roles via vitamin D receptor (VDR) in mucosal immunity, host defense, and inflammation involving host factors and microbiome. Human Vdr gene variation shapes the microbiome and VDR deletion leads to dysbiosis. Low VDR expression and diminished vitamin D/VDR signaling are observed in colon cancer. Nevertheless, how intestinal epithelial VDR is involved in tumorigenesis through gut microbiota remains unknown. We hypothesized that intestinal VDR protects mice against dysbiosis via modulating the JAK/STAT pathway in tumorigenesis. To test our hypothesis, we used an azoxymethane/Dextran Sulfate Sodium-induced cancer model in intestinal VDR conditional knockout (VDR\u0394IEC) mice, cell cultures, stem-cell derived colonoids, and human colon cancer samples.","Background Nutrition is a modifiable risk factor for ischemic stroke. As people age their ability to absorb some nutrients decreases, an example is vitamin B12. Older individuals with a vitamin B12 deficiency are at a higher risk for stroke and have worse outcome. However, the mechanisms through which these occur remain unknown.","Background Intermittent fasting or calorie restriction (CR) diets provide anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective advantages in models of multiple sclerosis (MS); data in humans are sparse.","Background The knowledge of clinically relevant markers distribution might become a useful tool in COVID-19 therapy using personalized approach in the lack of unified recommendations for COVID-19 patients management during pandemic. We aimed to identify the frequencies and distribution patterns of rs11385942 and rs657152 polymorphic markers, associated with severe COVID-19, among populations of the world, as well at the national level within Russia. The study was also dedicated to reveal whether population frequencies of both polymorphic markers are associated with COVID-19 cases, recovery and death rates.","There are currently no preventative options for recurrent aphthous stomatitis, and the only available treatments are palliative. This is partly due to a poor understanding of its etiopathogenesis. In this case-control study, we characterized the salivary proteome of patients with recurrent aphthous stomatitis in the presence and absence of lesions. Through mass spectrometry-based proteomics and bioinformatics tools, we identified that the presence of oral ulcers is associated with several specific biological processes, including the metabolic pathways of vitamin B9, B12, nitrogen, selenium, and the bacterium Neisseria meningitidis. These changes occurred only in the presence of clinically visible lesions, and there were no relevant differences between patients in anatomical regions unaffected by ulcers. Additionally, using western blot and ELISA assays, we verified that carbonic anhydrase 1 (CA1, UniProtKB - P00915, CAH1_HUMAN) and hemoglobin subunit beta (HBB, UniProtKB - P68871, HBB_HUMAN) proteins are highly expressed during the ulcerative and remission phases of recurrent aphthous stomatitis. Our results cumulatively support saliva as an indicator of the pathophysiological changes, which occur during the clinical course of lesions. From a clinical perspective, we suggest that recurrent aphthous stomatitis is a condition triggered by temporary biological changes in people with lesions.","Objectives Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly around the world, and many risk factors including patient demographics, social determinants of health, environmental variables, underlying health conditions, and adherence to social distancing have been hypothesized to affect case and death rates. However, little has been done to account for the potential confounding effects of these factors. Using a large multivariate analysis, this study illuminates modulators of COVID-19 incidence and mortality in U.S. counties while controlling for risk factors across multiple domains.","Aim: Androgenic alopecia (AA) is defined as progressive miniaturization of scarless hair follicle prevailing among both male and female. Telogen effluvium (TE) is the most common hair loss form accompanying systemic diseases. It is aimed to determine the role of vitamine D, the significance of which has been increasing in recent years, in hair loss problem within the scope of this study.  Methods: The patients who applied to Dermatology clinic with the complaint of hair loss and diagnosed androgenic alopecia and telogen effluvium by clinic examination between the years 2015-2016 were included into this study. The age, gender and 25'OHvitamin-D level of the patients were recorded retrospectively. Results: One-hundred eighty seven (N=187) participants (140 female / 47 male) were included in this study. Fifty-eight (N=58) patients (28 female / 30 male) with androgenic alopecia diagnosis formed the first group; 71 patients (65 female / 6 male) with telogen effluvium were formed the second group and 58 healthy volunteers (47 female / 11male) were included in the control group. When Vitamin-D level of first group (AA) was compared with that of the second group (TE) and the control group, there was a statistically significant difference observed (p=0.01/p=0.01 respectively). However, there was no statistically significant difference between the vitamin-D level of second group (TE) and that of the healthy control group (p=0.61). Conclusion: The level of 25'(OH) vit D was found high in androgenic alopecia group than telogen effluvium and controls. Revealing the relationship between vitamin-D level and hair loss might give us the opportunity to come up with new treatment options considering refractory patients.","Background African American (AA) prostate cancer (PCa) appears uniquely sensitive to 1\u03b1,25(OH)2D3 signaling, compared to European American (EA) PCa, but the extent and impact of vitamin D receptor genomic functions remain poorly defined.","Motivation Protein cleavage is an important cellular event, involved in a myriad of processes, from apoptosis to immune response. Bioinformatics provides in silico tools, such as machine learning-based models, to guide target discovery. State-of-the-art models have a scope limited to specific protease families (such as Caspases), and do not explicitly include biological or medical knowledge (such as the hierarchical protein domain similarity, or gene-gene interactions). To fill this gap, we present a novel approach for protease target prediction based on data integration.","Purpose The aims of this study were; 1) to evaluate if there is an association between the serum levels of the novel insulin-like adipokine isthmin-1 (ISM1) and obesity-related phenotypes in a population of Spanish children, 2) to investigate the plausible molecular alterations behind the alteration of the serum levels of this protein in children with obesity.","Background The prognosis of patients with COVID-19, with older age and comorbidities, is associated with a more severe course and higher fatality rates but no analysis has yet included factors related to the geographical area/municipality in which the affected patients live. So the objective of this study is to analyse the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 in terms of sex, age, comorbidities, and geographic variables.","Purpose Vitamin D has been proposed as a potential causal factor in COVID-19 risk. We aimed to establish whether blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration was associated with COVID-19 mortality, and inpatient confirmed COVID-19 infection, in UK Biobank participants.","Dendritic cells (DCs) play a crucial role in balancing immune responses, and in that sense the interactions between the B7-1 and B7-2 molecules expressed on DCs and CD28 and CTLA-4 on helper T cells are fundamental. While coupling of B7 and CD28 molecules activates immune responses, binding of B7 to CTLA4 results in its blockade. CTLA4-Ig fusion protein, a competitor molecule of the B7-CD28 interaction, has been used for the development of immunological tolerance both experimentally and in patients. Here, we evaluated the effects of adoptive transfer of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) pulsed with CTLA4-Ig in TNBS-induced colitis. CTLA4-Ig-modulated BMDCs or na\u00efve BMDC were administered intravenously to BALB/c mice prior to TNBS rectal instillation. Five days later, spleens and colon segments were removed for immunological and histological analysis. Our results showed that the adoptive transfer of CTLA4-Ig-modulated BMDCs was able to reduce the severity of inflammation caused by the administration of TNBS, in view of tissue integrity and reduced leukocyte infiltration in the colon segments of the treated mice compared to controls. Non-specific spleen cell activation in vitro showed a reduction in the frequency of CD4+ IL-17+ T cells and CD4+ IFN-\u03b3+ T cells as well as IL-9 secretion in cultures. To our knowledge, this is the first description of the beneficial effects of treatment with CTLA4-Ig modulated BMDC in experimental colitis.","Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common metabolic disease in humans, affecting the majority of individuals. In the current investigation, we aim to identify potential key genes linked with NAFLD through bioinformatics analyses of next generation sequencing (NGS) dataset. NGS dataset of GSE135251 from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database were retrieved. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained by DESeq2 package. g:Profiler database was further used to identify the potential gene ontology (GO) and REACTOME pathways. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using the Hippie interactome database. miRNet and NetworkAnalyst databases were used to establish a miRNA-hub gene regulatory network and TF-hub gene regulatory network for the hub genes. Hub genes were verified based on receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis. Totally, 951 DEGs were identified including 476 up regulated genes and 475 down regulated genes screened in NAFLD and normal control. GO showed that DEGs were significantly enhanced for signaling and regulation of biological quality. REACTOME pathway analysis revealed that DEGs were enriched in signaling by interleukins and extracellular matrix organization. ESR2, JUN, PTN, PTGER3, CEBPB, IKBKG, HSPA8, SFN, CDKN1A and E2F1 were indicated as hub genes from PPI network, miRNA-hub gene regulatory network and TF-hub gene regulatory network. Furthermore, ROC analysis revealed that ESR2, JUN, PTN, PTGER3, CEBPB, IKBKG, HSPA8, SFN, CDKN1A and E2F1 might serve as diagnostic biomarkers in NAFLD. The current investigation provided insights into the molecular mechanism of NAFLD that might be useful in further investigations.","Background Little is known about the relative influence of demographic, behavioural, and vaccine-related factors on risk of post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection. We aimed to identify risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection after primary and booster vaccinations.","Publicly available genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics exhibit uneven quality, which can impact the validity of follow-up analyses. First, we present an overview of possible misspecifications that come with GWAS summary statistics. Then, in both simulations and real data analyses, we show that additional information such as imputation INFO scores, allele frequencies, and per-variant sample sizes in GWAS summary statistics can be used to detect possible issues and correct for misspecifications in the GWAS summary statistics. One important motivation for us is to improve the predictive performance of polygenic scores built from these summary statistics. Unfortunately, due to the lack of reporting standards for GWAS summary statistics, this additional information is not systematically reported. We also show that using well-matched LD references can improve model fit and translate into more accurate prediction. Finally, we discuss how to make polygenic score methods such as lassosum and LDpred2 more robust to these misspecifications to improve their predictive power.","The aim of this study was to evaluate the antibody reaction after administration of the BNT162b2 vaccine, and to reveal the factors that affect antibody production. This prospective study was carried out in the Association of EISEIKAI Medical and Healthcare Corporation Minamitama Hospital, in Tokyo, Japan, from April 15, 2021 to June 09, 2021. All our hospital\u2019s workers who were administered the BNT162b2 vaccine as part of a routine program were included in this study.","OBJECTIVE To evaluate the strength and validity of evidence on the association between the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) or tumour-associated neutrophils (TAN) and cancer prognosis.","Itch is a major symptom of many chronic skin diseases that can exacerbate inflammation by provoking excessive scratching and causing skin damage. Here we develop a novel technology to control itch through molecular guided delivery of a phototoxic agent and near infrared (IR) illumination of the skin. Exploiting the selective binding of the pruritogen Interleukin-31 to itch sensing cells, we generate an engineered IL31SNAP ligand derivative (IL31K138A-SNAP) that binds to cells but does not evoke signaling or provoke scratching when injected in vivo. Conjugation of IL31K138A-SNAP to the photosensitizer IRDye\u00ae700DX phthalocyanine (IR700) and injection of the skin results in long-term reversal of scratching behavior evoked by IL31 upon near IR illumination. We further develop a topical preparation of IL31 K138A-SNAP-IR700 that strikingly, reverses behavioral and dermatological indicators in mouse models of Atopic Dermatitis (AD) and the genetic skin disease Familial Primary Localized Cutaneous Amyloidosis (FPLCA). We demonstrate that this therapeutic effect results from selective retraction of itch sensing neurons in the skin, breaking the cycle of itch and disruption of the skin\u2019s barrier function. Thus, molecule guided photoablation is a powerful new technology for controlling itch and treating inflammatory skin diseases.","Patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) often present with skeletal abnormalities; a condition known as renal osteodystrophy (ROD). While Tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) and PHOSPHO1 are recognized to be critical for bone mineralization, their role in the etiology of ROD is unclear. To address this, ROD was induced in both wild-type and Phospho1 knockout (P1KO) mice using dietary adenine supplementation. The mice presented with hyperphosphatemia, hyperparathyroidism, and elevated levels of FGF23 and bone turnover markers. In particular, we noted that in CKD mice, bone mineral density (BMD) was increased in cortical bone (p &lt; 0.05) but decreased in trabecular bone (p &lt; 0.05). These changes were accompanied by decreased TNAP (p &lt; 0.01) and increased PHOSPHO1 (p &lt; 0.001) expression in wild-type CKD bones. In P1KO CKD mice, the cortical BMD phenotype was rescued, suggesting that the increased cortical BMD of CKD mice was driven by increased PHOSPHO1 expression. Other structural parameters were also improved in P1KO CKD mice. We further investigated the driver of the mineralization defects, by studying the effects of FGF23, PTH, and phosphate administration on PHOSPHO1 and TNAP expression by primary murine osteoblasts. We found both PHOSPHO1 and TNAP expression to be down-regulated in response to phosphate and PTH. While matrix mineralization was increased with phosphate (Pi), it decreased with PTH and FGF23 had no effect. The in vitro data suggest that the TNAP reduction in CKD-MBD is driven by the hyperphosphatemia and/or hyperparathyroidism noted in these mice, while the higher PHOSPHO1 expression may be a compensatory mechanism in an attempt to protect the bone from hypomineralization. We propose that increased PHOSPHO1 expression in ROD may contribute to the disordered skeletal mineralization characteristic of this progressive disorder.","Three-dimensional (3D) imaging of osteocyte lacunae has recently substantiated the connection between lacunar shape and size, and osteocyte age, viability, and mechanotransduction. Yet it remains unclear why individual osteocytes reshape their lacunae and how networks of osteocytes change in response to local alterations in mechanical loads. We evaluated the effects of local mechanical stimuli on osteocyte lacunar morphometrics in tibial cortical bone from young female mice flown on the Space Shuttle for \u223c13 days. We optimized scan parameters, using a laboratory-based submicrometer-resolution X-Ray Microscope, to achieve large \u223c 0.3 mm3 fields of view with sufficient resolution (\u2265 0.3 \u03bcm) to visualize and measure thousands of lacunae per scan. Our novel approach avoids large measurement errors that are inherent in 2D and enables a facile 3D solution as compared to the lower resolution from benchtop micro-computed tomography (CT) systems or the cost and inaccessibility of synchrotron-based CT. Osteocyte lacunae were altered following microgravity exposure in a region-specific manner: more elongated (+7.0% Stretch) in predominately tensile-loaded bone as compared to those in compressively-loaded regions. In compressively-loaded bone, lacunae formed in microgravity were significantly larger (+6.9% Volume) than in the same region formed on Earth. We also evaluated lacunar heterogeneity (i.e., spatial autocorrelation of lacunar morphometric parameters) via kriging models. These statistical models demonstrated that heterogeneity varied with underlying spatial contributors, i.e. the local mechanical and biological environment. Yet in the absence of gravitational loading, osteocyte lacunae in newly formed bone were larger and were collectively more homogenous than in bone formed on Earth. Overall, this study shows that osteocyte reshape their lacunae in response to changes, or absence, in local mechanical stimuli and different biological environments. Additionally, spatial relationships among osteocytes are complex and necessitate evaluation in carefully selected regions of interest and of large cell populations.","Objective To investigate the effectiveness of pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMFs) for the management of primary osteoporosis in older adults.","Objective MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are promising tools as biomarkers and therapeutic agents in various chronic diseases such as osteoporosis, cancers, type I and II diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Considering the rising interest in the regulatory role of miRNAs in bone metabolism, aging, and cellular senescence, accurate normalization of qPCR-based miRNA expression data using an optimal endogenous control becomes crucial.","Degrading cells of wheat and barley callus have all known ultrastructural features, which are characteristic for apoptotic cells: intense vacuolization, increasing the size of the nucleus, cupped invaginations of plastids, mitochondria saving until the last stages of cell degradation and the formation of vesicles, similar to apoptotic bodies. It is the first showed that degrading cells in embryogenic callus are characterized with the destruction of the nuclear membrane and the allocated substances of fibrillar nature in the periplasmic space and on the surface of cells.","Background Private retail pharmacies in developing countries present a unique channel for COVID-19 prevention. We assessed the response to the COVID-19 pandemic by pharmacies in Kenya, aiming to identify strategies for maximising their contribution to the national response.","Background Multimorbidity presents an increasing challenge in the global ageing population. Predicting its development is necessary to help design and deliver effective healthcare.","Seasonal exposures influence human health and development. The placenta, as a mediator of the maternal and fetal systems and a regulator of development, is an ideal tissue to understand the biological pathways underlying relationships between season of birth and later life health outcomes. Here, we conducted a transcriptome-wide association study of season of birth in full-term human placental tissue to evaluate whether the placenta may be influenced by seasonal cues. Of the analyzed transcripts, 583 displayed differential expression between summer and winter births (FDR q&lt;0.05); among these, BHLHE40, MIR210HG, and HILPDA had increased expression among winter births (Bonferroni p&lt;0.05). Enrichment analyses of the seasonally variant genes between summer and winter births indicated over-representation of transcription factors HIF1A, VDR, and CLOCK, among others, and of GO term pathways related to ribosomal activity and infection. Additionally, a cosinor analysis found rhythmic expression for approximately 11.9% of all 17,664 analyzed placental transcripts. These results suggest that the placenta responds to seasonal cues and add to the growing body of evidence that the placenta acts as a peripheral clock, which may provide a molecular explanation for the extensive associations between season of birth and health outcomes.","Background and Aims High alcohol intake is associated with increased mortality. We aimed to identify factors affecting mortality in people drinking extreme amounts. Approach and Results. Information was obtained from the UK Biobank on approximately 500,000 participants aged 40-70 years at baseline assessment in 2006-2010. Habitual alcohol intake, lifestyle and physiological data, laboratory test results, and hospital diagnoses and death certificate data (to June 2020) for 5136 men (2.20% of male participants) and 1504 women (0.60%) who reported taking \u226580 g/day or \u226550g/day, respectively, were used in survival analysis. Compared to all other participants, their mortality HRs were 9.40 (95% CI 7.00-12.64) for any liver disease (ICD-10 K70-K76), 2.02 (1.89-2.17) for all causes, 1.89 (1.69-2.12) for any cancer (C00-C99), and 1.87 (1.61-2.17) for any circulatory disease (I00-I99). Liver disease diagnosis or abnormal liver function tests predicted not only deaths attributed to liver disease but also those from cancers or circulatory diseases. Mortality among excessive drinkers was also associated with quantitative alcohol intake, diagnosed alcohol dependence (ICD-10 F10.2), and current smoking at assessment.  Conclusions. People with chronic excessive alcohol intake experience decreased average survival but there is substantial variation in their mortality, with liver abnormality and alcohol dependence each associated with worse prognosis. Clinically, patients with these risk factors as well as high alcohol intake should be considered for early or intensive management. Research can usefully focus on the factors predisposing to dependence or liver abnormality.","Diets rich in fruits and vegetables have been shown to exert positive effects on the gut microbiome. However, little is known about the specific effect of individual fruits or vegetables on gut microbe profiles. This study aims to elucidate the effects of tomato consumption on the gut microbiome, as tomatoes account for 22% of vegetable consumption in Western diets, and their consumption has been associated with positive health outcomes. Using piglets as a physiologically relevant model of human metabolism, 20 animals were assigned either to a control or tomato powder supplemented diet (both macronutrient matched and isocaloric) for 14 days. The microbiome was sampled rectally at three time points: day 0 (baseline), day 7 (midpoint), and at day 14 (end of study). DNA was sequenced using shotgun metagenomics, and reads were annotated using MG-RAST. There were no differences in body weight or feed intake between our two treatment groups. There was a microbial shift which included a higher ratio of Bacteroidota to Bacillota (formerly known as Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, respectively) and higher alpha-diversity in tomato-fed animals, indicating a shift to a more desirable phenotype. Analyses at both the phyla and genera levels showed global microbiome profile changes (PERMANOVA P \u2264 0.05) over time, but not with tomato consumption. These data suggest that short-term tomato consumption can beneficially influence the gut microbial profile, warranting further investigation in humans.","The COVID-19 outbreak is triggering a global crisis that is challenging governments, health systems and the scientific community worldwide1. A central question in the COVID-19 pandemic is whether climatic factors modulate its progression. This information is key to epidemiologists and healthcare decision-makers for improving their management plans2. Previous attempts to assess the impact of climatic parameters have yielded ambiguous results, either because they were using geographically or temporally restricted data, or because they were comparing infection rates across countries, which were measured differently depending on local screening strategies. In March 2020, the spread of COVID-19 dramatically increased the number of countries recording deaths3, providing an opportunity to use mortality rate, which is measured more homogeneously across countries than infection rates, as a descriptor of the COVID-19 outbreak over a large latitudinal range. Here, using data recorded in 208 territories from 88 countries, we show that mortality rate is negatively influenced by warmer air temperature and positively affected by higher relative humidity. Each additional Celsius degree decreases mortality rate by \u223c4%, while a 1% increase in relative humidity raises mortality rate by \u223c2%. Temperature is positively correlated with UV-index, for which one unit of increase results in a \u223c15% decrease in the mortality rate. We also show that other factors contribute to the dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak, such as the proportion of vulnerable age classes in the population, access to a non-overwhelmed health system, as well as governmental travel restrictions for controlling the spread of the disease. All of them are critical factors impacting the mortality rate of COVID-19. The influence of climatic factors is a warning to all southern hemisphere countries where winter is coming soon. Northern hemisphere countries should also be warned that climatic factors alone will likely not be sufficient to contain the disease.","Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a negative effect on the health and behavior of the world\u2019s population.","Emerging evidence has indicated that microbial transmission from the bovine dam to her fetus may take place before birth, and that the maternal microbiota during pregnancy modulates programming of fetal metabolic and nervous system development, highlighting the potential and extended role of the maternal microbiome in calf health and development. In the present study, we characterized the nasopharyngeal, ruminal and vaginal microbiota from two cohorts of beef heifers managed at the same location: 1) virgin yearling heifers (9 months old) born from dams received gestational diets which resulted in low (LG, n = 22) or medium (MG, n = 23) weight gain during the first 84 days of gestation; and 2) pregnant replacement heifers that received a vitamin and mineral supplement (VTM, n = 17) or not (Control, n = 15) during the first 6 months of gestation. Nasopharyngeal and vaginal swabs as well as ruminal fluid were collected from both cohorts and the microbiota of each sample was assessed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. In addition to the comparison between treatment groups within each cohort, the similarity of the microbiota of the three sample types were evaluated, and shared taxa amongst these communities were identified. The bacterial genera present in the rumen and vagina that can influence methanogenic archaeal genera were predicted using a stepwise-selected generalized linear mixed model. No significant difference was observed in the alpha and beta diversity in any of the nasopharyngeal, ruminal and vaginal microbiota between LG and MG offspring virgin heifers, or between the control and VTM pregnant heifers (p &gt; 0.05). Subtle compositional changes in the vaginal microbiota in yearling heifers, and in the nasopharyngeal and ruminal microbiota of pregnant heifers were detected in response to treatments. Forty-one archaeal and bacterial OTUs were shared by over 60% of all samples from both virgin and pregnant heifers. Two taxa within the Methanobrevibacter genus were identified as core taxa and this genus was more relatively abundant in pregnant heifers compared to virgin heifers. Among the 25 top genera, Prevotella and Prevotella UCG-003 (negative) and Christensenellaceae R-7 group (positive) were predicted to have a significant effect on ruminal Methanobrevibacter spp. The results of this study indicate that there is little impact of divergent gestational nutrition during the first trimester on the calf microbiome at 9 months postnatal, and that VTM supplementation during pregnancy may not alter the maternal microbiome. This study provides evidence that there are several microbial taxa, including methanogenic archaea, that are shared across the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and reproductive tracts, suggesting the need for a holistic evaluation of the bovine microbiota when considering potential maternal sources for seeding calves with pioneer microbiota.","The inherited brittle bone disease osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is commonly caused by COL1A1 and COL1A2 mutations that disrupt the collagen I triple helix. This causes intracellular endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention of the misfolded collagen and can result in a pathological ER stress response. A therapeutic approach to reduce this toxic mutant load could be to stimulate mutant collagen degradation by manipulating autophagy and/or ER-associated degradation. Since carbamazepine (CBZ) both stimulates autophagy of misfolded collagen X and improves skeletal pathology in a metaphyseal chondrodysplasia model, we tested the effect of CBZ on bone structure and strength in 3 week-old male OI Col1a2 +/p.G610C and control mice. Treatment for 3 or 6 weeks with CBZ, at the dose effective in metaphyseal chondrodysplasia, provided no therapeutic benefit to Col1a2 +/p.G610C mouse bone structure, strength, or composition, measured by micro-computed tomography, three point bending tests and Fourier-transform infrared microspectroscopy. In control mice however, CBZ treatment for 6 weeks impaired femur growth and led to lower femoral cortical and trabecular bone mass. These data, showing the negative impact of CBZ treatment on the developing mouse bones, raise important issues which must be considered in any human clinical applications of CBZ in growing individuals.","Although a defective vitamin D pathway has been widely suspected to be associated in SARS-CoV-2 pathobiology, the status of the vitamin D pathway and vitamin D-modulated genes in lung cells of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown. To understand the significance of the vitamin D pathway in SARS-CoV-2 pathobiology, computational approaches were applied to transcriptomic datasets from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cells of such patients or healthy individuals. Levels of vitamin D receptor, retinoid X receptor, and CYP27A1 in BALF cells of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 were found to be reduced. Additionally, 107 differentially expressed, predominantly downregulated genes modulated by vitamin D were identified in transcriptomic datasets from patient\u2019s cells. Further analysis of differentially expressed genes provided eight novel genes with a conserved motif with vitamin D-responsive elements, implying the role of both direct and indirect mechanisms of gene expression by the dysregulated vitamin D pathway in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Network analysis of differentially expressed vitamin D-modulated genes identified pathways in the immune system, NF-KB/cytokine signaling, and cell cycle regulation as top predicted pathways that might be affected in the cells of such patients. In brief, the results provided computational evidence to implicate a dysregulated vitamin D pathway in the pathobiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Background Hypovitaminosis-D has been linked to neuropsychiatric conditions, but little is known about vitamin D status in individuals with chronic tic disorders (CTD). This study sought to determine whether vitamin D levels are associated with the severity of tics and presence and severity of comorbid obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and/ or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).","Major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) molecules display peptides on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) for inspection by CD4+ T cells. MHCII surface levels and life span are regulated post-translationally by peptide loading and ubiquitin-dependent lysosomal targeting, but proteases responsible for MHCII protein degradation remain unidentified. Here, we examined the role of aspartyl proteases in MHCII protein degradation and characterised the form of MHCII that is degraded. Exposure of immature monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs) and KG-1 acute myeloid leukaemia cells to the aspartyl protease inhibitor, pepstatin A (PepA), caused accumulation of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR molecules in intracellular vesicles. Statistically significant PepA effects on MHCII protein expression were also observed in murine APCs. In KG-1 cells, cathepsin D (CatD) was the sole expressed aspartyl protease, and shRNA-mediated knockdown ablated the PepA effect, providing formal proof of CatD involvement. In vitro, CatD initiated specific cleavage of recombinant DR at \u03b1F54, a site flanking the peptide-binding groove. Immunochemical characteristics of PepA-rescued DR molecules in KG-1 cells were consistent with selective CatD attack on HLA-DR molecules that lack association with the MHCII chaperone, invariant chain, or with stably bound peptide. We propose that CatD has a critical role in the selective lysosomal disposal of mature HLA-DR molecules that have lost, or never acquired, bound peptide, explaining how MHCII protein life span is coupled to peptide loading.","Despite the accumulating evidence that increased consumption of ultra-processed food has adverse health implications, it remains difficult to decide what constitutes processed food. Indeed, the current processing-based classification of food has limited coverage and does not differentiate between degrees of processing, hindering consumer choices and slowing research on the health implications of processed food. Here we introduce a machine learning algorithm that accurately predicts the degree of processing for any food, indicating that over 73% of the U.S. food supply is ultra-processed. We show that the increased reliance of an individual\u2019s diet on ultra-processed food correlates with higher risk of metabolic syndrome, diabetes, angina, elevated blood pressure and biological age, and reduces the bio-availability of vitamins. Finally, we find that replacing foods with less processed alternatives can significantly reduce the health implications of ultra-processed food, suggesting that access to information on the degree of processing, currently unavailable to consumers, could improve population health.","We present an effective model All-Trans Retinoic Acid (ATRA)-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells. The model describes a key architectural feature of ATRA-induced differentiation, positive feedback between an ATRA-inducible signalsome complex involving many proteins including Vav1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, and the activation of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. The model, which was developed by integrating logical rules with kinetic modeling, was significantly smaller than previous models. However, despite its simplicity, it captured key features of ATRA induced differentiation of HL-60 cells. We identified an ensemble of effective model parameters using measurements taken from ATRA-induced HL-60 cells. Using these parameters, model analysis predicted that MAPK activation was bistable as a function of ATRA exposure. Conformational experiments supported ATRA-induced bistability. These findings, combined with other literature evidence, suggest that positive feedback is central to a diversity of cell fate programs.","Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies enable a better understanding of previously unexplored biological diversity. Oftentimes, researchers are specifically interested in modeling the latent structures and variations enriched in one target scRNA-seq dataset as compared to another background dataset generated from sources of variation irrelevant to the task at hand. For example, we may wish to isolate factors of variation only present in measurements from patients with a given disease as opposed to those shared with data from healthy control subjects. Here we introduce Contrastive Variational Inference (contrastiveVI; https://github.com/suinleelab/contrastiveVI), a framework for end-to-end analysis of target scRNA-seq datasets that decomposes the variations into shared and target-specific factors of variation. On four target-background dataset pairs, we apply contrastiveVI to perform a number of standard analysis tasks, including visualization, clustering, and differential expression testing, and we consistently achieve results that agree with known biological ground truths.","BACKGROUND Rapid case ascertainment (RCA) refers to the expeditious and detailed examination of patients with a potentially rapidly fatal disease shortly after diagnosis. RCA is frequently performed in resource-rich settings to facilitate cancer research. Despite its utility, RCA is rarely implemented in resource-limited settings and has not been performed for malignancies. One cancer and context that would benefit from RCA in a resource-limited setting is HIV-related Kaposi sarcoma (KS) in sub-Saharan Africa.","Background Nations are imposing unprecedented measures at large-scale to contain the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. Recent studies indicate that measures such as lockdowns may have slowed down the growth of COVID-19. However, in addition to substantial economic and social costs, these measures also limit the exposure to Ultraviolet-B radiation (UVB). Emerging observational evidence indicate the protective role of UVB and vitamin D in reducing the severity and mortality of COVID-19 deaths. In this observational study, we empirically outline the independent protective roles of lockdown and UVB exposure as measured by ultraviolet index (UVI), whilst also examining whether the severity of lockdown is associated with a reduction in the protective role.","Neck of femur (NOF) fracture is a prevalent fracture type amongst the ageing and osteoporotic populations, commonly requiring total hip replacement (THR) surgery. Increased fracture risk has also been associated with Alzheimer disease (AD) in the aged. Here, we sought to identify possible relationships between the pathologies of osteoporosis and dementia by analysing bone expression of neurotropic or dementia-related genes in patients undergoing THR surgery for NOF fracture. Femoral bone samples from 66 NOF patients were examined for expression of the neurotropic genes amyloid precursor protein (APP), APP-like protein-2 (APLP2), Beta Secretase Cleaving Enzyme-1 (BACE1) and nerve growth factor (NGF). Relationships were examined between the expression of these and of bone regulatory genes, systemic factors and bone structural parameters ascertained from plain radiographs. We found strong relative levels of expression and positive correlations between APP, APLP2, BACE1 and NGF levels in NOF bone. Significant correlations were found between APP, APLP2, BACE1 mRNA levels and bone remodelling genes TRAP, RANKL, and the RANKL:OPG mRNA ratio, indicative of potential functional relationships at the time of fracture. Analysis of the whole cohort, as well as non-dementia and dementia sub-groups, revealed structural relationships between APP and APLP2 mRNA expression and lateral femoral cortical thickness. These findings suggest that osteoporosis and AD may share common molecular pathways of disease progression, perhaps explaining the common risk factors associated with these diseases. The observation of a potential pathologic role for AD-related genes in bone may also provide alternative treatment strategies for osteoporosis and fracture prevention.","Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is essential during development and in organ physiology. In the canonical pathway, Hh binding to Patched (PTCH) relieves the inhibition of Smoothened (SMO). Yet, PTCH may also perform SMO-independent functions. While the PTCH homolog PTC-3 is essential in C. elegans, worms lack SMO, providing an excellent model to probe non-canonical PTCH function. Here, we show that PTC-3 is a cholesterol transporter. ptc-3(RNAi) leads to accumulation of intracellular cholesterol and defects in ER structure and lipid droplet formation. These phenotypes were accompanied by a reduction in acyl chain (FA) length and desaturation. ptc-3(RNAi)-induced lethality, fat storage and ER morphology defects were rescued by reducing dietary cholesterol. We provide evidence that cholesterol accumulation modulates the function of nuclear hormone receptors such as of the PPAR\u03b1 homolog NHR-49 and NHR-181, and affects FA composition. Our data uncover a novel role for PTCH in organelle structure maintenance and fat metabolism.","Background Long COVID, or post-COVID-19 sequelae, is being seen in a growing number of patients reporting a constellation of symptoms, both pulmonary and extrapulmonary. Studies on COVID-19 recovered patients are scarce. Thus, there is a need to add granularity to our existing knowledge about the course and long-term effects of the infection.","","Background Despite perennial sunshine, vitamin D deficiency is prevalent among Malaysian especially pregnant women.","Membrane-less organelles are condensates formed by phase separation whose functions often remain enigmatic. Upon oxidative stress, PML scaffolds Nuclear Bodies (NBs) to regulate senescence or metabolic adaptation, but their role in pluripotency remains elusive. Here we establish that PML is required for basal SUMO2/3 conjugation in mESCs and oxidative stress-driven sumoylation in mESCs or in vivo. PML NBs create an oxidation-protective environment for UBC9-driven SUMO2/3 conjugation of PML partners, often followed by their poly-ubiquitination and degradation. Differential in vivo proteomics identified several members of the KAP1 complex as PML NB-dependent SUMO2-targets. The latter drives functional activation of this key epigenetic repressor. Accordingly, Pml\u2212/\u2212 mESCs re-express transposable elements and display features of totipotent-like cells, a process further enforced by PML-controlled SUMO2-conjugation of DPPA2. Finally, PML is required for adaptive stress responses in mESCs. Collectively, PML orchestrates mESC fate through SUMO2-conjugation of key transcriptional or epigenetic regulators, raising new mechanistic hypotheses about PML roles in normal or cancer stem cells.","Loss-of-function mutations in ALPL result in hypophosphatasia (HPP), an inborn error of metabolism that causes skeletal mineralization defect. In adults, main clinical involvement includes early loss of primary or secondary teeth, osteoporosis, bone pain, chondrocalcinosis, and fractures. However, guidelines for the treatment of adults with HPP are not available. Here, we show that ALPL deficiency caused reduction of intracellular Ca2+ influx resulting in osteoporotic phenotype due to downregulated osteogenic differentiation and upregulated adipogenic differentiation in both human and mouse BMSCs. To elevate intracellular level of calcium in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) by ionomycin treatment rescues the osteoporotic phenotype in alpl+/- mice and BMSC-specific (Prrx1-alpl-/-) conditional alpl knockout mice. Mechanistically, ALPL is required to maintain intracellular Ca2+ influx by regulating L-type Ca2+ channel trafficking via binding to the \u03b12\u03b4 subunits, which regulates the internalization of L-type Ca2+ channel. Decreased Ca2+ flux inactivates Akt/GSK3\u03b2/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway that regulates lineage differentiation of BMSCs. This study identifies a previous unknown role of ectoenzyme ALPL in maintenance of calcium channel trafficking to keep stem cell lineage differentiation and bone homeostasis. Accelerating Ca2+ flux through L-type Ca2+ channel by ionomycin treatment may be a promising therapeutic approach for adult HPP patients.","Multiple studies have suggested the spread of COVID-19 is affected by factors such as climate, BCG vaccinations, pollution and blood type. We perform a joint study of these factors using the death growth rates of 40 regions worldwide with both machine learning and Bayesian methods. We find weak, non-significant (&lt; 3\u03c3) evidence for temperature and relative humidity as factors in the spread of COVID-19 but little or no evidence for BCG vaccination prevalence or PM2.5 pollution. The only variable detected at a statistically significant level (&gt;3\u03c3) is the rate of positive COVID-19 tests, with higher positive rates correlating with higher daily growth of deaths.","Background ATL1102 is a 2\u2019MOE gapmer antisense oligonucleotide to the CD49d alpha subunit of VLA-4. ATL1102 inhibits expression of CD49d on lymphocytes, thereby reducing their survival, activation and migration to sites of inflammation. Children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) have dystrophin deficient muscles. These are susceptible to contraction induced injury which triggers the immune system, exacerbating muscle damage. CD49d is a biomarker of disease severity in DMD, with increased numbers of high CD49d expressing T cells correlating with more severe and progressive weakess, despite corticosteroid treatment.","Vitamin D is a pro-hormone, essential for musculo-skeletal health, normal immune system, and numerous other body functions. Vitamin D deficiency is considered a risk factor in many conditions, and there is growing evidence of its potential role in the severity of COVID-19 outcomes. However, an alarmingly high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is reported in many regions, and vitamin D supplementation is commonly recommended, particularly during wintertime. To reduce the risk for vitamin D deficiency in the Slovenian population during the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted mass media intervention with an educational campaign. The objective of this study was to investigate vitamin D supplementation practices in Slovenia before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to determine the effects of the educational intervention on supplementation practices. Two data collections were conducted using an online panel with quota sampling for age, sex, and geographical location. A pre-intervention (N=602, April 2020) and post-intervention (N=606) sampling were done during the first and second COVID-19 lockdown, respectively. We also focused on the identification of different factors connected to vitamin D supplementation, with a particular emphasis on vitamin D-related knowledge. Study results showed significant changes in vitamin D supplementation in the population. Penetration of the supplementation increased from 33% in April to 56% in December 2020. The median daily vitamin D intake in supplement users was 25 \u00b5g, with about 95% of supplement users taking safe intake levels below 100 \u00b5g/daily. Vitamin D-related knowledge (particularly about dietary sources of vitamin D, the health-related impact of vitamin D, and the prevalence of deficiency) was identified as a key independent predictor of vitamin D supplementation. Based on the study findings, we prepared recommendations, which will enable the development of effective awareness campaigns for increasing supplementation of vitamin D.","Background Symptoms after COVID-19 infection affect the quality of life of its survivor especially to the special senses including olfactory function. It is important to prevent the disability at an earlier stage. Vaccination as key prevention has been proven to be effective in reducing symptomatic disease and severity. However, the effects of vaccination on post COVID symptoms have not been evaluated. This study aimed to evaluate the possible protection of full vaccination and the occurrence of post-COVID olfactory dysfunction, specifically anosmia and hyposmia in patients who were diagnosed with COVID19.","Fracture Liaison Services (FLSs) are recommended healthcare models to deliver secondary fracture prevention and reduce the risk of subsequent fractures. Several studies have demonstrated the cost and clinical effectiveness of FLSs, but there is little real-world data on the impact of FLSs on subsequent hip fracture rates.","Melanoma is notorious for its cellular heterogeneity, which is at least partly due to its ability to transition between alternate cell states. Similarly to EMT, melanoma cells with a melanocytic phenotype can switch to a mesenchymal-like phenotype. However, scattered emerging evidence indicates that additional, intermediate state(s) may exist. In order to search for such new melanoma states and decipher their underlying gene regulatory network (GRN), we extensively studied ten patient-derived melanoma cultures by single-cell RNA-seq of &gt;39,000 cells. Although each culture exhibited a unique transcriptome, we identified shared gene regulatory networks that underlie the extreme melanocytic and mesenchymal cell states, as well as one (stable) intermediate state. The intermediate state was corroborated by a distinct open chromatin landscape and governed by the transcription factors EGR3, NFATC2, and RXRG. Single-cell migration assays established that this \u201ctransition\u201d state exhibits an intermediate migratory phenotype. Through a dense time-series sampling of single cells and dynamic GRN inference, we unraveled the sequential and recurrent arrangement of transcriptional programs at play during phenotype switching that ultimately lead to the mesenchymal cell state. We provide the scRNA-Seq data with 39,263 melanoma cells on our SCope platform and the ATAC-seq data on a UCSC hub to jointly serve as a resource for the melanoma field. Together, this exhaustive analysis of melanoma cell state diversity indicates that additional states exists between the two extreme melanocytic and mesenchymal-like states. The GRN we identified may serve as a new putative target to prevent the switch to mesenchymal cell state and thereby, acquisition of metastatic and drug resistant potential.","Background Anthropometric measurements are quantitative measurements of the human body size, shape, and nutritional status. It is a simple, inexpensive, and non-invasive approach used to identify mothers at risk of labor outcomes. On the other hand, hematological disorders are common during pregnancy with deleterious health effects on the mother and the fetus, which consequently cause fetal growth retardation and low weight.","In recent years there has been growing evidence regarding the effect of microbiota on the skeletal growth and homeostasis. Here we present, for the first time, accelerated longitudinal and radial bone growth in young (7-week-old) germ-free male rats after short-term exposure to a newly established gut microbiota. Changes in bone mass and structure were analyzed after 10 days following the onset of colonization through cohousing with conventional rats and revealed unprecedented acceleration of bone accrual in cortical and trabecular compartments, increased bone tissue mineral density, improved proliferation and hypertrophy of growth plate chondrocytes, bone lengthening, and preferential deposition of periosteal bone in tibia diaphysis. In addition, the number of small-in-size adipocytes increased, while the number of megakaryocytes decreased, in the bone marrow of conventionalized germ-free rats. The observed changes in bone status were paralleled with a positive shift in microbiota composition towards short chain fatty acids (SCFA)-producing microbes, which reflected a dramatic increase in cecal concentration of SCFA, specifically butyrate. Further, reconstitution of the host holobiont increased hepatic expression of IGF-1 and its circulating levels, implicating an involvement of the somatotropic axis. Increased serum levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D and alkaline phosphatase pointed toward an active process of bone formation. The acute stimulatory effect on bone growth occurred independently of body mass increase and resembled reversal of dysbiosis in adolescence, which is marked by rapid skeletal expansion. These findings may help in developing microbiota-based therapeutics to combat bone related disorders resulting from hormonal defects and/or malnutrition in children and adolescence.","  Breastfeeding benefits both infants and mothers. Nutrients in mother's milk\nhelp protect infants from multiple diseases including infections, cancers,\ndiabetes, gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases. We performed literature\nmining on 31,496 mother's-milk-related abstracts from PubMed and the results\nsuggest the need for individualized mother's milk fortification and proper\nmaternal supplementations (e.g. probiotics, vitamin D), because mother's milk\ncompositions (e.g. fatty acids) vary according to maternal diet and responses\nto infection in mothers and/or infants. We review at details the variability\nobserved in mother's milk compositions and its possible health effects in\ninfants. We also review the effects of storage practices on mother's milk\nnutrients, recommended durations for mother's milk intake and the associated\nhealth benefits.\n","Cranial growth and development affects the closely related traits of head circumference (HC) and intracranial volume (ICV). Here we model the developmental genetic architecture of HC, showing this is genetically stable and correlated with genetic determinants of ICV. Investigating up to 46,000 children and adults of European descent, we identify association with final HC and/or final ICV+HC at 9 novel common and low-frequency loci, illustrating that genetic variation from a wide allele frequency spectrum contributes to cranial growth. The largest effects are reported for low-frequency variants within TP53, with 0.5 cm wider heads in increaser-allele carriers versus non-carriers during mid-childhood.","Objective The association between vitamin D deficiency and multiple sclerosis (MS) is well described. We set out to use remote sampling to ascertain vitamin D status and vitamin D supplementation in a cross-sectional study of people with MS across the UK.","Background Seasonal disease outbreaks are perennial features of human infectious disease but the factors generating these patterns are unclear. In animal studies, seasonal and circadian (daily) rhythms in immune function generate periodicity in vulnerability to disease, although it is not known whether the same applies to humans. Making use of extensive data from the UK Biobank cohort, we investigate seasonal and daytime variability in multiple immune parameters (inflammatory markers, white blood cell counts and antibody titres), and test for associations with a wide range of environmental and lifestyle factors.","Objective To examine whether sleep and pain-related traits have a causal effect on the risk of neurodegeneration.","COVID-19 vaccines based on the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 have been developed that appear to be largely successful in stopping infection. However, vaccine escape variants might arise leading to a re-emergence of COVID. In anticipation of such a scenario, the identification of repurposed drugs that stop SARS-CoV-2 replication could have enormous utility in stemming the disease. Here, using a nano-luciferase tagged version of the virus (SARS-CoV-2- DOrf7a-NLuc) to quantitate viral load, we evaluated a range of human cell types for their ability to be infected and support replication of the virus, and performed a screen of 1971 FDA-approved drugs. Hepatocytes, kidney glomerulus, and proximal tubule cells were particularly effective in supporting SARS-CoV-2 replication, which is in- line with reported proteinuria and liver damage in patients with COVID-19. We identified 35 drugs that reduced viral replication in Vero and human hepatocytes when treated prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection and found amodiaquine, atovaquone, bedaquiline, ebastine, LY2835219, manidipine, panobinostat, and vitamin D3 to be effective in slowing SARS-CoV-2 replication in human cells when used to treat infected cells. In conclusion, our study has identified strong candidates for drug repurposing, which could prove powerful additions to the treatment of COVID.","BACKGROUND As of January 1, 2021, there have been 81,947,503 confirmed cases of COVID-19, resulting in 1,808,041 deaths worldwide. Several vaccines are now available for emergency use, but it will take many months to immunize the world\u2019s population. There is a pressing need for outpatient treatment now. We reviewed the possible options","Introduction Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) was predicted to be severely affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, but the actual data seem to have contradicted these forecasts. This study attempted to verify this observation by comparing predictions against actual data on the spread and burden of the COVID-19 pandemic in SSA.","Osteoporosis is a metabolic bone disease that occurs during aging, characterized by low bone mineral density (BMD) and a high risk of trauma fracture. While current pharmacological interventions provide symptomatic benefits, they are unsatisfactory and have major side effects. In this study, we used multi-omics data and drug similarity to construct osteoporosis driver signaling networks (ODSN) and drug functional networks (DFN), respectively. By integrating ODSN and DFN with treatment transcriptional responses, we observed 8 drugs that demonstrated strong targeting effects on ODSN. Mendelian Randomization analysis determines the causal effect on BMD using cis-eQTLs of the drug targets and BMD GWAS data. The findings suggested Acebutolol and Amiloride may increase BMD, while Acenocoumarol, Aminocaproic acid and Armodafinil may enhance bone loss. Zebrafish experiments experimentally showed Acebutolol hydrochloride and Amiloride hydrochloride had significant protective effects on osteoporosis in zebrafish embryos induced by Dexamethasone. Also, Acenocoumarol reduced bone mineralization compared with the control group. The findings suggest that the hypertension drugs Acebutolol and Amiloride warrant further investigation in functional mechanistic experiments to evaluate their effectiveness for osteoporosis treatments.","Asthenozoospermia is a usual male infertility factor, characterized by decreased semen quality. It has been revealed that antioxidants improve sperm function, enhance endogenous antioxidant activities, and protect spermatozoa against oxidative damage during cryopreservation. This aimed to evaluate the effects of vitamin D on sperm kinematics and apoptosis in the semen of bulls with normozoospermia and asthenozoospermia after the freeze-thaw process. For this purpose, 32 semen samples of four Holstein bulls (normozoospermic, progressive motility &gt; 70 %) and 32 semen samples of four bull (asthenozoospermic progressive motility &lt; 40 %) were collected and pooled separately (normozoospermic and asthenozoospermic). Samples were then diluted into four equal aliquots of extender containing different vitamin D concentrations (0, 5, 10, and 50 ng/mL) and aspirated into a 0.5 mL straw. The percentages of sperm progressive motility and viability were significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) in 50 ng/mL of vitamin D in normozoospermic group. Sperm kinematics parameters including curvilinear velocity (VCL), straight-line velocity (VSL), and average path velocity (VAP) were significantly higher in the high dose (50 ng/mL) vitamin D-treated group compared to the low dose vitamin D-treated group (5ng/mL) in normozoospermic bull semen samples. The supplementation of the semen extender with different concentrations of vitamin D could not increase the rate of acrosome integrity in normozoospermic bulls compared to the control group (P &lt; 0.05). In the asthenozoospermic group, 10 ng/mL vitamin D-treated group could increase the rate of plasma membrane integrity compared to 5 ng/mL vitamin D-treated group (P &lt; 0.05). The percentages of early-apoptosis (P = 0.049) and late-apoptosis (P = 0.005) were significantly higher in the asthenozoospermic than the normozoospermic group. The present study revealed that a high dose (50 ng/mL) of vitamin D protected normozoospermic bulls' sperms from the freezing procedure and lead to higher quality of frozen-thawed bull sperm.","Vitamin D is a well-known micronutrient that modulates immune responses by epigenetic and transcriptional regulation of target genes, such as inflammatory cytokines. Our group recently demonstrated that the most active form of vitamin D, calcitriol, reduces expression of a transcription factor known as the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and inhibits differentiation of a pro-inflammatory T cell subset, Th9. Lithocholic acid (LCA), a secondary bile acid produced by commensal bacteria, is known to bind to and activate the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in a manner comparable to calcitriol. In this study, Na\u00efve CD4 T cells were isolated from healthy human umbilical mononuclear cells and were stimulated in the presence or absence of LCA. We determined the effect of LCA on human cord blood T cell activation by measuring IFN-\u03b3 production and protein expression of IFN-\u03b3 receptor-mediated signaling molecules. We found that LCA reduces production of IFN-\u03b3 and decreases phosphorylation of STAT1 as well as expression of AhR, STAT1, and IRF1 by activated human cord blood CD4 T cells. LCA inhibits expression of IFN-\u03b3 and reduces its receptor signaling molecules.","Background In adolescents with severe and persistent gender dysphoria (GD), gonadotropin releasing hormone analogues (GnRHa) are used from early/middle puberty with the aim of delaying irreversible and unwanted pubertal body changes. Evidence of outcomes of pubertal suppression in GD is limited.","Background Household overcrowding is associated with increased risk of infectious diseases across contexts and countries. Limited data exist linking household overcrowding and risk of COVID-19. We used data collected from the Virus Watch cohort to examine the association between overcrowded households and SARS-CoV-2.","Wrist-worn accelerometer actigraphy devices present the opportunity for large-scale data collection from people during their daily lives. Using data from approximately 100,000 participants in the UK Biobank, actigraphy-derived measures of physical activity, sleep, and diurnal rhythms were associated in exploration and validation cohorts with a full phenome-wide set of diagnoses, biomarkers and metadata. Rhythmicity was captured by two independent models based on accelerometer and skin temperature harnessing behavioral (diurnal) and molecular (circadian) components. We found that robust rhythms significantly with biomarkers, survival, and phenotypes including diabetes, hypertension, mood disorders, and chronic airway obstruction; these associations were comparable to those with physical activity and sleep. Surprisingly, associations were mostly consistent between the sexes, while modulation by age was significant. More importantly, rhythms were found to be powerful predictors of future diseases: a two standard deviation difference in wrist temperature rhythms corresponded to increases in rate of diagnosis of 61% in diabetes, 38% in chronic airway obstruction, 27% in anxiety disorders, and 22% in hypertension. Our PheWAS of actigraphy data in the UK Biobank establishes that rhythmicity is fundamental to modeling disease trajectories, as are physical activity and sleep. Integration of long-term remote biosensing into patient care could thus afford an individualized approach to risk management.","Vitamin D has a well-established role in skeletal health and is increasingly linked to chronic disease and mortality in humans and companion animals. Despite the clear significance of vitamin D for health and obvious implications for fitness under natural conditions, no longitudinal study has tested whether the circulating concentration of vitamin D is under natural selection in the wild. Here, we show that concentrations of dietary-derived vitamin D2 and endogenously-produced vitamin D3 metabolites are heritable and largely polygenic in a wild population of Soay sheep (Ovis aries). Vitamin D2 status was positively associated with female adult survival, and vitamin D3 status predicted female fecundity in particular, good environment years. Our study provides evidence that vitamin D status has the potential to respond to selection, as well as new insights into how vitamin D metabolism is associated with fitness in the wild.","Vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) or GC-globulin carries vitamin D metabolites from the circulation to target tissues. DBP expression is highly-localized to the liver and pancreatic \u03b1-cells. While DBP serum levels, gene polymorphisms and autoantigens have all been associated with diabetes risk, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we show that DBP regulates \u03b1-cell morphology, \u03b1-cell function and glucagon secretion. Deletion of DBP led to smaller and hyperplastic \u03b1-cells, altered Na+ channel conductance, impaired \u03b1-cell activation by low glucose, and reduced rates of glucagon secretion. Mechanistically, this involved reversible changes in islet microfilament abundance and density, as well as changes in glucagon granule distribution. Defects were also seen in \u03b2-cell and \u03b4-cell function. Immunostaining of human pancreata revealed generalized loss of DBP expression as a feature of late-onset and longstanding, but not early-onset type 1 diabetes. Thus, DBP is a critical regulator of \u03b1-cell phenotype, with implications for diabetes pathogenesis.","Background It is clear that in UK healthcare workers, COVID-19 infections and deaths were more likely to be in staff who were of BAME origin. This has led to much speculation about the role of vitamin D in healthcare worker COVID-19 infections. We aimed to determine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in NHS staff who have isolated with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 and relate this to vitamin D status.","Background With the growing adoption of the electronic health record (EHR) worldwide over the last decade, new opportunities exist for leveraging EHR data for detection of rare diseases. Rare diseases are often not diagnosed or delayed in diagnosis by clinicians who encounter them infrequently. One such rare disease that may be amenable to EHR-based detection is acute hepatic porphyria (AHP). AHP consists of a family of rare, metabolic diseases characterized by potentially life-threatening acute attacks and, for some patients, chronic debilitating symptoms that negatively impact daily functioning and quality of life. The goal of this study was to apply machine learning and knowledge engineering to a large extract of EHR data to determine whether they could be effective in identifying patients not previously tested for AHP who should receive a proper diagnostic workup for AHP.","Background There is insufficient evidence to support clinical decision-making for cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19 due to the lack of large studies.","Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a metabolic disorder for which the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unclear. This investigation aimed to elucidate essential candidate genes and pathways in T1DM by integrated bioinformatics analysis. In this study, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed using DESeq2 of R package from GSE162689 of the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis, REACTOME pathway enrichment analysis, and construction and analysis of protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, modules, miRNA-hub gene regulatory network and TF-hub gene regulatory network, and validation of hub genes were then performed. A total of 952 DEGs (477 up regulated and 475 down regulated genes) were identified in T1DM. GO and REACTOME enrichment result results showed that DEGs mainly enriched in multicellular organism development, detection of stimulus, diseases of signal transduction by growth factor receptors and second messengers, and olfactory signaling pathway. The top hub genes such as MYC, EGFR, LNX1, YBX1, HSP90AA1, ESR1, FN1, TK1, ANLN and SMAD9 were screened out as the critical genes among the DEGs from the PPI network, modules, miRNA-hub gene regulatory network and TF-hub gene regulatory network. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis and RT-PCR confirmed that these genes were significantly associated with T1DM. In conclusion, the identified DEGs, particularly the hub genes, strengthen the understanding of the advancement and progression of T1DM, and certain genes might be used as candidate target molecules to diagnose, monitor and treat T1DM.","Although glioblastoma is a fatal primary brain cancer with a short median survival of 15 months, a small number of patients survive more than 5 years after diagnosis; they are known as extreme survivors (ES). Due to their rarity, very little is known about what differentiates these outliers from other glioblastoma patients. For the purpose of identifying unknown drivers of extreme survivorship in glioblastoma, we developed the ENDURES consortium (ENvironmental Dynamics Underlying Responsive Extreme Survivors of glioblastoma). This consortium is a multicenter collaborative network of investigators focused on the integration of multiple types of clinical data and the creation of patient-specific models of tumor growth informed by radiographic and histological parameters. Leveraging our combined resources, the goals of the ENDURES consortium are two-fold: (1) to build a curated, searchable, multilayered repository housing clinical and outcome data on a large cohort of ES patients with glioblastoma and (2) to leverage the ENDURES repository for new insights on tumor behavior and novel targets for prolonging survival for all glioblastoma patients. In this article, we review the available literature and discuss what is already known about ES. We then describe the creation of our consortium and some of our preliminary results.","Antizyme inhibitor 1 (AZIN1) is a critical target in prostate cancer, which regulates the adenosine-to-inosine (A to I) RNA editing during the cancer progression. However, the potential signaling pathways and functions remain unknown. Here, our objective is to figure out the functional molecules and signaling pathways by analyzing the RNA-seq data. The GSE189379 was produced by the Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens). The KEGG and GO analyses showed that focal adhesion and proteoglycans are the mainly affected processes in prostate cancer with the loss of AZIN1. Moreover, we identified ten key molecules including FN1, HRAS, CCND1, RAD51, PCNA, TYMS, CASP3, RRM2, BIRC5, and CCNE2. Therefore, this study provides novel knowledge of AZIN1 mediated prostate cancer.","Inference of clinical phenotypes is a fundamental task in precision medicine, and has therefore been heavily investigated in recent years in the context of electronic health records (EHR) using a large arsenal of machine learning techniques, as well as in the context of genetics using polygenic risk scores (PRS). In this work, we considered the epigenetic analog of PRS, methylation risk scores (MRS), a linear combination of methylation states. Since methylation states are influenced by both environmental and genetic factors, we hypothesized that MRS would complement PRS and EHR-based machine-learning methods, improving overall prediction accuracy. To evaluate this hypothesis, we performed the largest assessment of methylation risk scores in clinical datasets to be conducted to date. We measured methylation across a large cohort (n=831) of diverse samples in the UCLA Health biobank, for which both genetic and complete EHR data are available. We constructed MRS for 607 phenotypes spanning diagnoses, clinical lab tests, and medication prescriptions. When added to a baseline set of predictive features, MRS significantly improved the imputation of 139 outcomes, whereas the PRS improved only 22 (median improvement for methylation 10.74%, 141.52%, and 15.46% in medications, labs and diagnosis codes, respectively, whereas genotypes only improved the labs at a median increase of 18.42%). We added significant MRS to state-of-the-art EHR imputation methods that leverage the entire set of medical records, and found that including MRS as a medical feature in the algorithm significantly improves EHR imputation in 37% of lab tests examined (median R2 increase 47.6%). Finally, we replicated several MRS in multiple external studies of methylation (minimum p-value of 2.72 \u00d7 10\u22127) and replicated 22 of 30 tested MRS internally in two separate cohorts of different ethnicity. In summary, our work provides a comprehensive evaluation of MRS in comparison to PRS and EHR imputation on the largest dataset consisting of methylation, genotype, and EHR data. Our publicly available results and weights show promise for methylation risk scores as clinical and scientific tools.","Background/Aims Litter size is one of the most important reproductive traits in pig breeding, which is affected by multiple genes and the environment. Ovaries are the most important reproductive organs and have a profound impact on the reproduction efficiency. Therefore, genetic differences in the ovaries may contribute to the observed differences in litter size. Although QTLs and candidate genes have been reported to affect the litter size in many pig breeds, however, the findings cannot elucidate the marked differences of the reproductive traits between breeds. The aim of present work is to elucidate the mechanisms of the differences for the reproductive traits and identify candidate genes associated with litter size in Xiang pig breed.","Background Shatavari has long been used as an Ayurvedic herb for women\u2019s health, but empirical evidence for its effectiveness has been lacking. Shatavari contains phytoestrogenic compounds that bind to the estradiol receptor, and may therefore benefit postmenopausal women since postmenopausal estradiol deficiency contributes to sarcopenia and osteoporosis.","Le deficit et l'insuffisance en vitamine D, definis respectivement par des concentrations seriques de 25 hydroxyvitamine D (25OHD) inferieures a 20 ng/ml et entre 20 et 30 ng/ml, sont des situations tres frequentes qui sont associees a une augmentation du risque de developper differentes pathologies, pas seulement osseuses. Les effets d'une supplementation en vitamine D sur la diminution du risque de fractures et de chutes sont documentes par differentes etudes d'intervention. Les autres effets potentiels extra-osseux de la vitamine D sont principalement documentes par des etudes observationnelles et experimentales. Meme s'il n'existe pas encore de consensus sur les besoins en vitamine D, tous les experts s'accordent pour considerer que les AJR (200 UI/J en France) sont tres insuffisants et doivent etre augmentes. Cet article aborde successivement le metabolisme de la vitamine D et ses effets, la definition du statut vitaminique D basee sur la concentration serique de 25OHD, les indications du dosage de la 25OHD (qui ne doit pas etre prescrit a tout le monde) et propose des modalites de traitement.Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency defined by a 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) serum level &lt; 20 ng/ml and between 20 and 30 ng/ml, respectively, are two highly frequent conditions that are associated with an increased risk of developing several pathologies, not only of the skeleton. While decreasing the risk of fractures and falls with vitamin D supplementation is well-documented by intervention studies, the other potential effects of vitamin D are mostly documented by observational and experimental studies. Even if a consensus on the optimal requirement does not exist, all experts agree on the fact that the current recommended dietary intakes (200 IU/day in France) are extremely insufficient and must be increased. The present review describes the metabolism and effects of vitamin D, discusses the way the definitions of vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency are established, as well as the patients in whom 25OHD should be measured. Finally it proposes different protocols to supplement/treat with vitamin D.","Exposure to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) during childhood is nearly ubiquitous by age two, and infants who develop severe RSV bronchiolitis are more likely to develop asthma later in life. In the Factors Influencing Pediatric Asthma (FIPA) study including 319 children from a Northern Plains American Indian community, we found 73% of children to have high concentrations of RSV-specific IgG (&gt;40 IU/mL). High concentration of RSV-specific IgG was associated with increased exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke (p=7.5\u00d710\u22124), larger household size (p=4.0\u00d710\u22123), and lower levels of total serum IgE (p=5.1\u00d710\u22123). Parents of children with asthma more often reported an RSV diagnosis and/or hospitalization due to RSV, and children with asthma had lower concentrations of RSV IgG as compared to those without asthma among RSV-exposed individuals (mean 117 IU/mL vs. 154, p=7.1\u00d710\u22124). However, lower RSV IgG was surprisingly exclusive to children with asthma recruited during the winter months when RSV is thought to circulate more broadly. Multivariate regression indicated the strongest predictors of RSV-specific IgG concentration included asthma status (p=0.040), per cent eosinophils (p=0.035), and an asthma x RSV season interaction (p=3.7\u00d710\u22123). Among candidate genes, we identified a genetic association between an intronic variant in IFNL4 and RSV-specific IgG concentration whereby the minor allele (A) was associated with higher concentration (rs12979860, p=4.3\u00d710\u22123). Overall our findings suggest there are seasonal differences in immunological response to RSV infection in asthma cases vs. controls, and identify both environmental and genetic contributions that warrant further investigation.","Background Emerging evidence has demonstrated that microbiota directly affects the enteric neuron system (ENS) and smooth muscle cell functions via metabolic products or endogenous bacterial components. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis is a neuromuscular disease characterized by the progressive death of motor neurons and muscle atrophy. The GI symptoms in patients were largely ignored or underestimated, especially before the diagnosis of ALS. The relationship between enteric neuromuscular system and microbiome in ALS progression is unknown.","Protective variables for COVID-19 are unknown. \u2018Trained immunity\u2019 of the populace as a result of BCG immunization policy implementation and coverage had been suggested to be one of the factors responsible for the differential impact of COVID-19 on different countries. Several trials are underway to evaluate the potential protective role of BCG vaccination in COVID-19. However, the lack of clarity on the use of appropriate controls concerning the measures of \u2018trained immunity\u2019 or the heterologous cell-mediated immunity conferred by BCG vaccination has been a cause of concern leading to more confusion as exemplified by a recently concluded trial in Israel that failed to find any protective correlation with regard to BCG vaccination. Whereas, when we analyze the COVID-19 data of European countries without any regard for BCG vaccination policy but with similar age distribution, comparable confounding variables, and the stage of the pandemic, the prevalence of tuberculin immunoreactivity - a measure of cell-mediated immunity persistence as a result of Mycobacterium spp. (including BCG vaccine) exposure of the populations, is found consistently negatively correlated with COVID-19 infections and mortality per million population, at all the time points evaluated. We propose that on-going and future studies evaluating the effect of BCG vaccination on COVID-19 outcomes may actively consider, if not already, the inclusion of controls for underlying \u2018trained immunity\u2019 and heterologous cell-mediated immunity prevalence that may be pre-existing or resulting from the intervention (e.g., BCG vaccine) in such trials to arrive at more dependable conclusions concerning their potential benefit.","Most information about distal radius microstructure is based on the non-dominant forearm, with little known about the factors that contribute to bilateral asymmetries in the general population, or what factors may influence bilateral changes over time. Here, we analyzed bilateral longitudinal high resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HRpQCT) data collected over a 12-month period as part of a clinical trial that prescribed a well-controlled, compressive loading task to the nondominant forearm. Baseline data from 102 women age 21-40, and longitudinal data from 66 women who completed the 12-month trial, were examined to determine factors responsible for side-to-side asymmetries in bone structure and change in structure over time. Cross-sectionally, the dominant radius had 2.4%-2.7% larger cross-sectional area, trabecular area, and bone mineral content than the nondominant radius, but no other differences were noted. Those who more strongly favored their dominant arm had significantly more, thinner, closely spaced trabecular struts in their dominant versus nondominant radius. Individuals assigned to a loading intervention had significant bilateral gains in total bone mineral density (2.0% and 1.2% in the nondominant versus dominan sides), and unilateral gains in cortical area (3.1%), thickness (3.0%), bone mineral density (1.7%) and inner trabecular density (1.3%). Each of these gains were significantly predicted by loading dose, a metric that included bone strain, number of cycles, and strain rate. Within individuals, change was negatively associated with age, meaning that women closer to age 40 experienced less of a gain in bone versus those closer to age 21. We believe that dominant/nondominant asymmetries in bone structure reflect differences in habitual loads during growth and past ability to adapt, while response to loading reflects current individual physiologic capacity to adapt.","Background We used summary statistics from previously-published GWAS of systolic and diastolic BP and of hypertension to construct Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) to predict hypertension across diverse populations.","Osteoporosis is a bone disease characterized by low bone density. The prevalence of osteoporosis varies between different populations and ethnic groups. Numerous studies have investigated the relationship between VDR gene polymorphisms and osteoporosis across ethnic populations. Present meta-analysis aims to comprehensively evaluate the influence of common FokI, BsmI, ApaI and TaqI VDR gene polymorphisms and osteoporosis. PubMed, Google Scholar, Springer Link and Elsevier databases were searched for eligible studies and all statistical calculations were performed by Open Meta-Analyst software. Studies investigated BsmI (65 studies; 6,880 case/ 8,049 control), ApaI (31 studies; 3,763 case/ 3,934 control), FokI (18 studies; 1,895 case/ 1,722 control), and TaqI (26 studies; 2,458 case/ 2,895 control) polymorphisms were included in the present meta-analysis. Results of meta-analysis revealed significant association between dominant model of FokI (ORff+Ff vs. FF= 1.19, 95% CI= 1.04-1.36, p= 0.01, I2= 39.36%) in overall analysis and recessive model of Caucasian population of TaqI polymorphism (ORTT+Tt vs. tt= 1.35, 95% CI= 1.11-1.63, p= 0.002, I2= 50.07%). While no such effect is found in any other genetic model in any other gene polymorphisms of the overall analyses or sub-group analyses. In conclusion, we found the FokI polymorphism is associated with osteoporosis in overall analysis, also the TaqI polymorphism is a risk factor for the Caucasian population.","Background Given its tolerance to stress and its richness in particular secondary metabolites, the tobacco tree, Nicotiana glauca, has been considered a promising biorefinery feedstock that would not be competitive with food and fodder crops.","Faced with the current large-scale public health emergency, collecting, sorting, and analyzing biomedical information related to the \u201ccoronavirus\u201d should be done as quickly as possible to gain a global perspective, which is a basic requirement for strengthening epidemic control capacity. However, for human researchers studying the viruses and the hosts, the vast amount of information available cannot be processed effectively and in a timely manner, particularly when the scientific understanding may be limited, which can further lower the information processing efficiency. We present TWIRLS, a method that can automatically acquire, organize, and classify information. Additionally, independent functional data sources can be added to build an inference system using a machine-based approach, which can provide relevant knowledge to help human researchers quickly establish subject cognition and to make more effective decisions. TWIRLS can automatically analyze more than three million words in more than 14,000 literature articles in only 4 hours. Combining with generalized gene interaction databases creates a data interface that can help researchers to further analyze the information. Using the TWIRLS system, we found that an important regulatory factor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) may be involved in the host pathological changes on binding to the coronavirus after infection. After triggering functional changes in ACE2/AT2R, an imbalance in the steady-state cytokine regulatory axis involving the Renin-Angiotensin System and IP-10 leads to a cytokine storm.","In this study, we present an effective model All-Trans Retinoic Acid (ATRA)-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells. The model describes reinforcing feedback between an ATRA-inducible signalsome complex involving many proteins including Vav1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, and the activation of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. We decomposed the effective model into three modules; a signal initiation module that sensed and transformed an ATRA signal into program activation signals; a signal integration module that controlled the expression of upstream transcription factors; and a phenotype module which encoded the expression of functional differentiation markers from the ATRA-inducible transcription factors. We identified an ensemble of effective model parameters using measurements taken from ATRA-induced HL-60 cells. Using these parameters, model analysis predicted that MAPK activation was bistable as a function of ATRA exposure. Conformational experiments supported ATRA-induced bistability. Additionally, the model captured intermediate and phenotypic gene expression data. Knockout analysis suggested Gfi-1 and PPAR$[gamma] were critical to the ATRA-induced differentiation program. These findings, combined with other literature evidence, suggested that reinforcing feedback is central to hyperactive signaling in a diversity of cell fate programs.","Following more than a century of phenotypic measurement of natural selection processes, much recent work explores relationships between molecular genetic measurements and realized fitness in the next generation. We take a novel approach to the study of contemporary selective pressure by examining which genetic variants are \u201csustained\u201d in populations as mortality exposure declines. Specifically, we deploy a so-called \u201cregional GWAS\u201d that links the infant mortality rate (IMR) by place and year in the UK with common genetic variants among cohorts in the UK Biobank. These cohorts (born 1936-1970) saw a decline in IMR from above 65 per 1,000 to under 20 per 1,000, with substantial subnational variation and spikes alongside wartime exposures. Our results show several genome-wide significant loci, including LCT and TLR10/1/6, related to area-level cohort IMR exposure during gestation and infancy. Genetic correlations are found across multiple domains, including fertility, cognition, health behaviors, and health outcomes, suggesting an important role for cohort selection in modern populations.","Aging is accompanied by a disrupted information flow, which results from accumulation of molecular mistakes. These mistakes ultimately give rise to debilitating disorders such as skeletal muscle wasting, or sarcopenia. To estimate the growing \u201cdisorderliness\u201d of the aging muscle system, we employed a statistical physics approach to estimate the state parameter, entropy, as a function of genes associated with hallmarks of aging. Although the most prominent structural and functional alterations were observed in the oldest old mice (27-29 months), we found that the escalating network entropy reached an inflection point at old age (22-24 months). To probe the potential for restoration of molecular \u201corder\u201d and reversal of the sarcopenic phenotype, we overexpressed the longevity protein, \u03b1-Klotho. Klotho overexpression modulated genes representing all hallmarks of aging in both old and oldest-old mice. However, whereas Klotho improved strength in old mice, intervention failed to induce a benefit beyond the entropic tipping point.","Background Vitamin D deficiency is common in older adults and has been linked with frailty and obesity, but it remains to be studied whether frail obese older adults are at higher risk of vitamin D deficiency. Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore the association between frailty, adiposity indices and serum 25(OH)D concentrations.","Background SARS-CoV-2 entry into type II pneumocytes is depended on the TMPRSS2 proteolytic enzyme. The only known promoter of TMPRSS2 in humans is an androgen response element. As such, androgen sensitivity may be a risk factor for COVID-19. Previously, we have reported a retrospective cohort analysis demonstrating the protective effect of 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (5ARis) in COVID-19. Men using 5ARis were less likely to be admitted to the ICU than men not taking 5ARis. Additionally, men using 5ARis had drastically reduced frequency of symptoms compared to men not using 5ARis in an outpatient setting. Here we aim to determine if 5ARis will be a beneficial treatment if given after SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Background Debate about whether high intake of dietary saturated fatty acids (SFA) causes coronary heart disease (the lipid hypothesis) is ongoing.","Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD) is a devastating disorder that is still not fully understood. Sex modifies AD vulnerability, but the reasons for this are largely unknown. There has been efforts to understand select comorbidities, covariates, and biomarkers of AD, with and without sex stratification - but there has not yet been an integrative, big data approach to identify clinical and sex specific associations with AD in an unbiased manner. Electronic Medical Records (EMR) contain extensive information on patients, including diagnoses, medications, and lab test results, providing a unique opportunity to apply phenotyping approaches to derive insights into AD clinical associations. Here, we utilize EMRs to perform deep clinical phenotyping and network analysis of AD patients to provide insight into its clinical characteristics and sex-specific clinical associations. We performed embeddings and network representation of patient diagnoses to visualize patient heterogeneity and comorbidity interactions and observe greater connectivity of diagnosis among AD patients compared to controls. We performed enrichment analysis between cases and controls and identified multiple known and new diagnostic and medication associations, such as positive associations with AD and hypertension, hyperlipidemia, anemia, and urinary tract infection - and negative associations with neoplasms and opioids. Furthermore, we performed sex-specific enrichment analyses to identify novel sex-specific associations with AD, such as osteoporosis, depression, cardiovascular risk factors, and musculoskeletal disorders diagnosed in female AD patients and neurological, behavioral, and sensory disorders enriched in male AD patients. We also analyzed lab test results, resulting in clusters of patient phenotype groups, and we observed greater calcium and lower alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in AD, as well as abnormal hemostasis labs in female AD. With this method of phenotyping, we can represent AD complexity, and identify clinical factors that can be followed-up for further temporal and predictive analysis or integrate with molecular data to aid in diagnosis and generate hypotheses about disease mechanisms. Furthermore, the negative associations can help identify factors that may decrease likelihood of AD and help motivate future drug repurposing or therapeutic approaches.","Till date the comprehensive clinical pictures, comorbid conditions, and long-term complications of COVID-19 are not known. Recently using a multi-omics-based strategy, we have predicted the drugs for COVID-19 management with \u223c70% accuracy. Here, using a similar multi-omics-based bioinformatics approach and three-ways of analysis, we identified the symptoms, comorbid conditions, and short, mid and possible long-term complications of COVID-19 with \u223c90% precision. In our analysis (i) we identified 27 parent, 170 child, and 403 specific conditions associated with COVID-19. (ii) Among the specific conditions, 36 are viral and 53 short-term, 62 short to mid to long-term, 194 mid to long-term, and 57 are congenital conditions. (iii) At a cut off \u201ccount of occurrence\u201d of 4, we found \u223c 90% of the enriched conditions are associated with COVID-19. (iv) Except the dry cough and loss of taste, all other COVID-19 associated mild and severe symptoms are enriched. (v) Cardiovascular, pulmonary, metabolic, musculoskeletal, neuropsychiatric, kidney, liver, and immune system disorders are found as top comorbid conditions. (vi) Specific diseases such as myocardial infarction, hypertension, COPD, lung injury, diabetes, cirrhosis, mood disorders, dementia, macular degeneration, chronic kidney disease, lupus, arthritis etc. along with several other diseases are also enriched as top candidates. (vii) Interestingly, many cancers and congenital disorders associated with COVID-19 severity are also identified. (viii) Arthritis, dermatomyositis, glioma, diabetes, psychiatric disorder, cardiovascular diseases having bidirectional relationship with COVID-19 are also found as top ranked conditions. Based on the accuracy (\u223c90%) of this analysis, long presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in human, and our previously proposed \u201cgenetic remittance\u201d assumption, we hypothesize that all the identified comorbid conditions including the short-long-mid and mid-long non-communicable diseases (NCDs) could also be long-term consequences in COVID-19 survivors and warrants long-term observational studies.","The chief and largely terminal element of normal blood clotting is considered to involve the polymerisation of the mainly \u03b1-helical fibrinogen to fibrin, with a binding mechanism involving \u2018knobs and holes\u2019 but with otherwise littl change in protein secondary structure. We recognise, however, that extremely unusual mutations, or mechanical stressing, can cause fibrinogen to adopt a conformation containing extensive \u03b2-sheets. Similarly, prions can change morphology from a largely alpha-helical to a largely \u03b2-sheet conformation, and the latter catalyses both the transition and the self-organising polymerisation of the \u03b2-sheet structures. Many other proteins can do this, where it is known as amyloidogenesis. When fibrin is formed in samples from patients harbouring different diseases it can have widely varying diameters and morphologies. We here develop the idea, and summarise the evidence, that in many cases the anomalous fibrin fibre formation seen in such diseases actually amounts to amyloidogenesis. In particular, fibrin can interact withthe amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) protein that is misfolded in Alzheimer's disease. Seeing these unusual fibrin morphologies as true amyloids explains a great deal about fibrin(ogen) biology that was previously opaque, and provides novel strategies for treating such coagulopathies. The literature on blood clotting can usefully both inform and be informed by that on prions and on the many other widely recognised (\u03b2)-amyloid proteins.","Background&amp; Aims The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global epidemic and has caused a lasting and huge loss of life security, economic development and social stability in more than 180 countries around the world. Unfortunately, there is still no specific treatment for COVID-19 till now, therefore, at this point, all potential therapies need to be critically considered. LL-37 is one of the best-studied human antimicrobial peptide (AMPs) that has a broad-spectrum activity against bacteria and viruses. The use of living, genetically modified organisms (GMOs) is an effective approach for delivery of therapeutic proteins. The aim of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of the Lactococcus lactis which has been genetically modified to produce the therapeutic human antimicrobial peptide LL-37 (herein after referred to cas001) in the patients of COVID-19.","Importance There is limited evidence regarding whether the presence of serum antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is associated with a decreased risk of future infection. Understanding susceptibility to infection and the role of immune memory is important for identifying at-risk populations and could have implications for vaccine deployment.","Events in early life contribute to subsequent risk of asthma; however, the causes and trajectories of childhood wheeze are heterogeneous and do not always result in asthma. Similarly, not all atopic individuals develop wheeze, and vice versa. The reasons for these differences are unclear. Using unsupervised model-based cluster analysis, we identified latent clusters within a prospective birth cohort with deep immunological and respiratory phenotyping. We characterised each cluster in terms of immunological profile and disease risk, and replicated our results in external cohorts from the UK and USA. We discovered three distinct trajectories, one of which is a high-risk \u201catopic\u201d cluster with increased propensity for allergic diseases throughout childhood. Atopy contributes varyingly to later wheeze depending on cluster membership. Our findings demonstrate the utility of unsupervised analysis in elucidating heterogeneity in asthma pathogenesis and provide a foundation for improving management and prevention of childhood asthma.","The circadian clock system regulates multiple metabolic processes, including bone metabolism. Previous studies have demonstrated that both central and peripheral circadian signaling regulate skeletal growth and homeostasis. Disruption in central circadian rhythms has been associated with a decline in bone mineral density and the global and osteoblast-specific disruption of clock genes in bone tissue leads to lower bone mass. Gut physiology is highly sensitive to circadian disruption. Since the gut is also known to affect bone remodeling, we sought to test the hypothesis that circadian signaling disruption in colon epithelial cells affects bone. We therefore assessed structural, functional, and cellular properties of bone in 8 week old Ts4-Cre and Ts4-Cre;Bmal1fl/fl (cBmalKO) mice, where the clock gene Bmal1 is deleted in colon epithelial cells. Axial and appendicular trabecular bone volume was significantly lower in cBmalKO compared to Ts4-Cre 8-week old mice in a sex-dependent fashion, with male but not female mice showing the phenotype. Similarly, the whole bone mechanical properties were deteriorated in cBmalKO male mice. The tissue level mechanisms involved suppressed bone formation with normal resorption, as evidenced by serum markers and dynamic histomorphometry. Our studies demonstrate that colon epithelial cell-specific deletion of Bmal1 leads to trabecular and cortical bone loss in male mice.","The total number of acquired melanocytic nevi on the skin is strongly correlated with melanoma risk. Here we report a meta-analysis of 11 nevus GWAS from Australia, Netherlands, United Kingdom, and United States, comprising a total of 52,506 phenotyped individuals. We confirm known loci including MTAP, PLA2G6, and IRF4, and detect novel SNPs at a genome-wide level of significance in KITLG, DOCK8, and a broad region of 9q32. In a bivariate analysis combining the nevus results with those from a recent melanoma GWAS meta-analysis (12,874 cases, 23,203 controls), SNPs near GPRC5A, CYP1B1, PPARGC1B, HDAC4, FAM208B and SYNE2 reached global significance, and other loci, including MIR146A and OBFC1, reached a suggestive level of significance. Overall, we conclude that most nevus genes affect melanoma risk (KITLG an exception), while many melanoma risk loci do not alter nevus count. For example, variants in TERC and OBFC1 affect both traits, but other telomere length maintenance genes seem to affect melanoma risk only. Our findings implicate multiple pathways in nevogenesis via genes we can show to be expressed under control of the MITF melanocytic cell lineage regulator.","Skin is the largest organ in the body and serves important barrier, regulatory, and sensory functions. Like other tissues, skin is subject to temporal fluctuations in physiological responses under both homeostatic and stressed states. To gain insight into these fluctuations, we investigated the role of the circadian clock in the transcriptional regulation of epidermis using a hybrid experimental design, where a limited set of human subjects (n=20) were sampled throughout the 24 h cycle and a larger population (n=219) were sampled once. By looking at pairwise correlations of core clock genes in 298 skin samples, we found a robust circadian oscillator in skin at the population level. Encouraged by this, we used CYCLOPS to reconstruct the temporal order of all samples and identified hundreds of rhythmically-expressed genes at the population level in human skin. We compared these results with published time-series skin data from mouse and show strong concordance in circadian phase across species for both transcripts and pathways. Further, like blood, skin is readily accessible and a potential source of biomarkers. Using ZeitZeiger, we identified a biomarker set for human skin that is capable of reporting circadian phase to within 3 h from a single sample. In summary, we show rhythms in human skin that persist at the population scale and a path to develop robust single-sample circadian biomarkers.","There is a general consensus that SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 deaths have hit lower social groups the hardest, however, for Germany individual level information on socioeconomic characteristics of infections and deaths does not exist. The aim of this study was to identify the key features explaining SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 deaths during the upswing of the second wave in Germany.","Introduction Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. On March 2, 2020, Indonesia announced the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection. East Kalimantan will play an important role as the new capital of Indonesia. There is attention to the preparedness of East Kalimantan to respond to COVID-19. We report the characteristics of COVID-19 fatality cases in here.","Background The gut microbiome may play a role in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric diseases including major depressive disorder (MDD). Bile acids (BAs) are steroid acids that are synthesized in the liver from cholesterol and further processed by gut-bacterial enzymes, thus requiring both human and gut microbiome enzymatic processes in their metabolism. BAs participate in a range of important host functions such as lipid transport and metabolism, cellular signaling and regulation of energy homeostasis. BAs have recently been implicated in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer\u2019s and several other neuropsychiatric diseases, but the biochemical underpinnings of these gut microbiome-linked metabolites in the pathophysiology of depression and anxiety remains largely unknown.","COVID-19 is a disease with vast impact, yet much remains unclear about patient outcomes. Most approaches to risk prediction of COVID-19 focus on binary or tertiary severity outcomes, despite the heterogeneity of the disease. In this work, we identify heterogeneous subtypes of COVID-19 outcomes by considering \u2018axes\u2019 of prognosis. We propose two innovative clustering approaches \u2212 \u2018Layered Axes\u2019 and \u2018Prognosis Space\u2019 \u2013 to apply on patients\u2019 outcome data. We then show how these clusters can help predict a patient\u2019s deterioration pathway on their hospital admission, using random forest classification. We illustrate this methodology on a cohort from Wuhan in early 2020. We discover interesting subgroups of poor prognosis, particularly within respiratory patients, and predict respiratory subgroup membership with high accuracy. This work could assist clinicians in identifying appropriate treatments at patients\u2019 hospital admission. Moreover, our method could be used to explore subtypes of \u2018long COVID\u2019 and other diseases with heterogeneous outcomes.","Objectives Until recently, randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses have not demonstrated convincing conclusions regarding the association of calcium intake with bone mineral density (BMD). Until now, it remains unclear whether high serum calcium levels are causally associated with BMD. This study aimed to investigate the genetic association between serum calcium levels and BMD using a large-scale serum calcium GWAS dataset and four large-scale BMD GWAS datasets in individuals of European descent.","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally and circulate in the blood, making them attractive biomarkers of disease state for tissues like bone that are challenging to interrogate directly. Here we report on five miRNAs \u2013 miR-197-3p, miR-320a, miR-320b, miR-331-5p, and miR-423-5p \u2013 that are associated with bone mineral density (BMD) in 147 healthy adult baboons. These baboons range in age from 15 to 25 years (45 to 75 human equivalent years) and were 65% female with a broad range of BMDs including a minority of osteopenic individuals. miRNAs were generated via RNA sequencing from buffy coats collected at necropsy and areal BMD evaluated via DXA of the lumbar vertebrae post-mortem. Differential expression analysis controlled for the underlying pedigree structure of these animals to account for genetic variation which may be driving miRNA abundance and BMD values. While many of these miRNAs have been associated with risk of human osteoporosis, this finding is of interest because the cohort represent a model of normal aging and bone metabolism rather than a disease cohort. The replication of miRNA associations with osteoporosis or other bone metabolic disorders in animals with healthy BMD suggests an overlap in normal variation and disease states. We suggest that these miRNAs are involved in the regulation of cellular proliferation, apoptosis, and protein composition in the extracellular matrix throughout life. However, age-related dysregulation of these systems may lead to disease causing associations of the miRNAs among individuals with clinically defined disease.","Objective One-carbon metabolism is a metabolic network that integrates nutritional signals with biosynthesis, redox homeostasis, and epigenetics. There are sex differences in hepatic one-carbon metabolism. However, it is unclear whether there are sex differences in dietary deficiencies of one-carbon metabolism in the brain. The aim of this study was to investigate if sex modulates the effects of dietary folic acid deficiency in brain tissue using a mouse model.","The serotonin 1A receptor (5-HT1A) system has been extensively implicated in modulating mood and behavior. Notably, 5-HT1A levels in humans display remarkable variation and differences in receptor levels have been linked with a variety of psychiatric disorders. Further, manipulation of receptor levels in mice suggests that changes in receptor levels that model existing human variation are sufficient to drive behavioral alterations. As a result, genetic mechanisms that modulate human 5-HT1A levels may be important for explaining individual differences in mood and behavior, representing a potential source of psychiatric disease risk. One common genetic variant implicated in differential 5-HT1A levels is the G/C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs6295, located upstream of the human 5-HT1A gene. This SNP differentially binds the transcription factor, NUDR/Deaf1, leading to cell-type specific effects on transcription in vitro. To investigate the direct effects of this SNP in the heterogeneous cellular context of the brain, we generated humanized transgenic mice using a design that maximized the local transcriptional landscape of the human HTR1A gene while also controlling for effects of genomic insertion location. Expression of the human transgene in a 5-HT1A null mouse resulted in line-dependent expression of human 5-HT1A. The effect of rs6295 on protein levels and behavior similarly differed across lines, suggesting that the penetrance of rs6295 may depend upon background genetic factors. Together, this work confirms that relatively subtle differences in 5-HT1A levels can contribute to differences in behavior and highlights the challenges of modeling human non-coding genetic variation in mice.","Background Among middle-aged and elderly individuals, dietary habits have previously been reported to differ between patients with and without periodontal disease. However, in young adults, there are only a few reports that show a correlation between nutrient/food intake and periodontal disease. Moreover, no report has assessed the correlation between dietary habits measured by a self-administered diet history questionnaire (DHQ) and periodontal disease. Therefore, we assessed the correlation between dietary habits, determined using a DHQ, and periodontal disease in young adult women who are likely to develop a periodontal disease.","Background Vitamin D has been widely promoted for bone health through supplementation and fortification of the general population. However, there is growing evidence that does not support these strategies. Our aim is to review the quality and recommendations on vitamin D nutritional and clinical practice guidelines and explore predictive factors for their direction and strength.","Superoxide, a form of reactive oxygen species (ROS), is catabolized by superoxide dismutase (SOD) and contributes to carcinogenesis via the oxidative damage it inflicts on cells. The aim of this research was to analyze the potential vitamin D-mediated regulation of the antioxidative \u201cSOD1-to-SOD2 switch\u201d within the human MG-63 osteosarcoma model. For this study, real-time PCR analysis was performed using MG-63 cells exposed to metabolically active 1,25(OH)2D3. Frist, a sustained statistically significant &gt;2-fold suppression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) transcripts was observed after 10nM but not at 100nM of 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment, suggesting a cytostatic effect. In order to assess regulators of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, gene expression of COX2 and COX4l1 of the mitochondrial complex IV and antioxidative enzymes (SOD1, SOD2 and Catalase (CAT)) were monitored. For COX2 and COX4l1, no changes in gene expression were observed. However, a concomitant decrease in CAT and SOD1 mRNA, and increase in SOD2 mRNA after 24 hours of 10nM 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment were observed. A ~8-fold increase in SOD2 mRNA was apparent after 48 hours. The significant increase in SOD2 activity in the presence of vitamin D indicates an antioxidant potential and sensitization of vitamin D during osteosarcoma transformation and mitochondrial detoxification over time.","Background Suicide attempts (SA) frequently occur in patients with mood disorders and schizophrenia, which are both accompanied by activated immune-inflammatory and nitro-oxidative (IO&amp;NS) pathways.","Background and Objective Survivors of moderate-severe traumatic brain injury (msTBI) frequently experience chronic, debilitating somatic symptoms, which are largely unexplained. The phenomenon of paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity, reflecting hyperacute autonomic dysfunction, is well-documented after msTBI. Limited animal and human studies, using experimental measures, have found evidence for autonomic dysfunction after msTBI. However, no studies have investigated the range and type of autonomic symptoms and autonomic dysfunction existing in msTBI.","Objectives To identify the risk of general practitioner mortality from COVID and the impact of measures to mitigate this risk on the level and socioeconomic distribution of primary care provision in the English NHS","Human herpesvirus (HHV)-6A or HHV-6B involvement in multiple sclerosis (MS) etiology has remained controversial mainly due to the lack of serological methods that can distinguish the two viruses.","Several observational studies indicate that dietary habits in children and adolescents are associated with school performance. These associations are heavily confounded by socio-economic characteristics, such as household income and parents\u2019 educational attainment, amongst other factors. In this study, we report observational and causal effects of habitual diet on school performance, using individual level data for 9,220 adolescents in the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986. For this purpose, we derived principal components for the dietary variables, meal patterns and school performance variables. The observational study showed a significant association of consumption of foods that are high in fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) with poor performance in all school subjects, and an association of consumption of healthy foods and traditional foods with good school performance in general subjects, science and physical education (PE). Moreover, a positive association was observed between not skipping breakfast and good performance in all school subjects. Mendelian randomisation analysis confirmed a negative effect of HFSS on school performance in general/science subjects (\u22120.080, \u22120.128 to \u22120.033) and a positive effect of healthy food on school performance in general/science subjects (0.071, 0.024 to 0.119) and PE (0.065, 0.021 to 0.110). To conclude, we identified compelling evidence that HFSS foods and healthy foods were causally affecting school performance.","High dietary phosphorus (P), particularly soluble salts, may contribute to chronic kidney disease development in cats. The aim of this study was to assess the safety of P supplied at 1g/1000kcal from a highly soluble P salt in P-rich dry format feline diets. Seventy-five healthy adult cats (n=25/group) were fed either a low P control (1.4g/1000 kcal; calcium:phosphorus ratio, Ca:P 0.97) or one of two test diets with 4g/1000 kcal (4184kJ); Ca:P 1.04 or 5g/1000kcal; Ca:P 1.27, both incorporating 1g/1000kcal (4184kJ) sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP) \u2013 for a period of 30 weeks in a randomised parallel-group study. Health markers in blood and urine, glomerular filtration rate, renal ultrasound and bone density were assessed at baseline and at regular time points. At the end of the test period, responses following transition to a commercial diet (total P \u2013 2.34g/1000kcal, Ca:P 1.3) for a 4-week washout period were also assessed. No adverse effects on general, kidney or bone (skeletal) function and health were observed. P and Ca balance, some serum biochemistry parameters and regulatory hormones were increased in cats fed test diets from week 2 onwards (p\u22640.05). Data from the washout period suggest that increased serum creatinine and urea values observed in the two test diet groups were influenced by dietary differences during the test period, and not indicative of changes in renal function. The present data suggest NOAELs for feline diets containing 1g P/1000kcal (4184kJ) from STPP and total phosphorus level of up to 5g/1000kcal (4184kJ) when fed for 30 weeks.","Sensory stimulation plays a critical role in the maturation of sensory organs and systems. For example, when deprived of light before birth, foetal mouse pups in utero exhibit altered ocular vascular development. Normal vascular development depends on light excitation of melanopsin, a non-rod, non-cone photopigment that is expressed in a subset of ganglion cells (mRGCs) in the retina. However, there is no direct evidence that mRGCs in foetal eyes are light-responsive. Very little is known about how light absorption leads to excitation in these foetal neurons. Using mRGC-specific expression of the calcium indicators GCaMP3 and GCaMP6, we report that foetal mouse mRGCs respond to light as early as 4 days before birth. Further, two distinct Gq/11-G protein family antagonists, FR9000359 and YM-254890, abolish these light responses. TTX, a blocker of voltage-activated sodium channels, reversibly represses light responses, and FPL6417 and L-cis-diltiazem, which modify L-type calcium channels, respectively increase and reduce light responses. Electrophysiological patch pipette recordings show that embryonic mRGCs respond to light of intensity as low as 2.9 \u00d7 1012 photons/cm2/s. The present findings demonstrate a heretofore unproven but postulated light sensitivity in the retinas of foetal mice and identify the transduction pathways involved. Surprisingly, mRGCs do not function as completely independent photoreceptors but are electrotonically coupled with other mRGCs. Given that melanopsin is expressed in foetal human retinas, these findings support the idea that the eyes of foetal and early preterm infants are likely to exhibit functional photosensitivity.","Ethnic minorities in developed countries suffer a disproportionately high burden of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, and COVID-19 ethnic disparities have been attributed to social determinants of health. Vitamin D has been proposed as a modifiable risk factor that could mitigate COVID-19 health disparities. We investigated the relationship between vitamin D and COVID-19 susceptibility and severity using the UK Biobank, a large progressive cohort study of the United Kingdom population. Structural equation modelling was used to evaluate the ability of vitamin D, socioeconomic deprivation, and other known risk factors to mediate COVID-19 ethnic health disparities. Asian ethnicity is associated with higher COVID-19 susceptibility, compared to the majority White population, and Asian and Black ethnicity are both associated with higher COVID-19 severity. Socioeconomic deprivation mediates all three ethnic disparities and shows the highest overall signal of mediation for any COVID-19 risk factor. Vitamin supplements, including vitamin D, mediate the Asian disparity in COVID-19 susceptibility, and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (calcifediol) levels mediate Asian and Black COVID-19 severity disparities. Several measures of overall health also mediate COVID-19 ethnic disparities, underscoring the importance of comorbidities. Our results support ethnic minorities\u2019 use of vitamin D as both a prophylactic and a supplemental therapeutic for COVID-19.","Background and objective The effect of calcium supplementation on bone mineral accretion in people under 35 years old is inconclusive. To comprehensively summarize the evidence for the effect of calcium supplementation on bone mineral accretion in young populations (\u226435 years).","Background We recently reported that individuals with impaired plantar sensation and high fall risk due to sensory peripheral neuropathy (PN) improved gait and balance function following 10 weeks of use of Walkasins\u00ae, a wearable lower limb sensory prosthesis that provides directional tactile stimuli related to plantar pressure measurements during standing and walking (RxFunction Inc., MN, USA). Here, we report 26-week outcomes and compare pre- and in-study fall rates. We expected improvements in outcomes and reduced fall rates reported after 10 weeks of use to be sustained.","Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic currently. Many drugs showed potential for COVID-19 therapy. However, genetic factors which can lead to different drug efficiency and toxicity among populations are still undisclosed in COVID-19 therapy.","Objectives The United Arab Emirates responded to the SARS-COV-2 pandemic and widely implemented test-and-trace strategy. In this cross-sectional questionnaire-based study 531 subjects presenting for SARS-COV-2 testing were recruited to study population\u2019s beliefs and choices regarding testing and were compared to 156 who never been tested.","Background/Objective Tight junctions (TJs) are essential for barrier integrity, inflammation, and cancer. The TJ protein Claudin-5 in the epithelia forms paracellular barriers and pores for permeability. Vitamin D and the vitamin D receptor (VDR) play important roles in various cancers. Although VDR and Claudin-5 are all involved in colorectal cancer (CRC), it remains unclear if they are closely related or function independently.","Background Until COVID-19 drugs specifically developed to treat COVID-19 become more widely accessible, it is crucial to identify whether existing medications have a protective effect against severe disease. Towards this objective, we conducted a large population study in Clalit Health Services (CHS), the largest healthcare provider in Israel, insuring over 4.7 million members.","Vitamin D deficiency is a major environmental risk factor for the development of multiple sclerosis (MS). The major circulating metabolite of vitamin D (25OHD) is converted to the active form (calcitriol) by the hydroxylase enzyme CYP27B1. In MS lesions the tyrosine kinase MerTK expressed by microglia and macrophages regulates phagocytosis of myelin debris and apoptotic cells that can accumulate and inhibit tissue repair and remyelination. We show that calcitriol downregulates MerTK mRNA and protein expression in adult human microglia and monocyte-derived macrophages, thereby inhibiting myelin phagocytosis and apoptotic cell clearance. Proinflammatory myeloid cells express high levels of CYP27B1 compared to homeostatic (TGF\u03b2-treated) myeloid cells. Only proinflammatory cells in the presence of TNF-\u03b1 generate calcitriol from 25OHD, resulting in repression of MerTK expression and function. The selective production of calcitriol in proinflammatory myeloid cells leading to downregulation of MerTK-mediated phagocytosis has the potential to reduce the risk for auto-antigen presentation while retaining the phagocytic ability of homeostatic myeloid cells, thereby contributing to inflammation reduction and enhanced tissue repair.","As a direct result of intense heat and aridity, deserts are thought to be among the most harsh of environments, particularly for their mammalian inhabitants. Given that osmoregulation can be challenging for these animals, with failure resulting in death, strong selection should be observed on genes related to the maintenance of water and solute balance. One such animal, Peromyscus eremicus, is native to the desert regions of the southwest United States and may live its entire life without oral fluid intake. As a first step toward understanding the genetics that underlie this phenotype, we present a characterization of the P. eremicus transcriptome. We assay four tissues (kidney, liver, brain, testes) from a single individual and supplement this with population level renal transcriptome sequencing from 15 additional animals. We identified a set of transcripts undergoing both purifying and balancing selection based on estimates of Tajima\u2019s D. In addition, we used the branch-site test to identify a transcript \u2013 Slc2a9, likely related to desert osmoregulation \u2013 undergoing enhanced selection in P. eremicus relative to a set of related non-desert rodents.","Vitamin D deficiency is known to be associated with symptoms of skeletal muscle myopathy including muscle weakness and fatigue. Recently, vitamin D related metabolites have been linked to the maintenance of mitochondrial function within skeletal muscle. However, current evidence is limited to in vitro models and the effects of diet-induced vitamin D deficiency upon skeletal muscle mitochondrial function in vivo have received little attention. In order to examine the role of vitamin D in the maintenance of mitochondrial function in vivo, we utilised an established model of diet-induced vitamin D deficiency in C57BL/6J mice. Mice were fed either a control (2,200 IU/kg) or a vitamin D deplete (0 IU/kg) diet for periods of 1-, 2- and 3-months. Skeletal muscle mitochondrial function and ADP sensitivity were assessed via high-resolution respirometry and mitochondrial protein content via immunoblotting. As a result of 3-month of diet-induced vitamin D deficiency, respiration supported via CI+IIP and ETC were 35% and 37% lower when compared to vitamin D replete mice (P &lt; 0.05). Despite functional alterations, the protein expression of electron transfer chain subunits remained unchanged in response to dietary intervention (P &gt; 0.05). In conclusion, we report that 3-months of diet-induced vitamin D deficiency reduced skeletal muscle mitochondrial function in C57BL/6J mice. Our data, when combined with previous in vitro observations, suggests that vitamin D mediated regulation of mitochondrial function may underlie the exacerbated muscle fatigue and performance deficits observed during vitamin D deficiency.","SARS-CoV-2 started spreading towards the end of 2019 causing COVID-19, a disease that reached pandemic proportions among the human population within months. The reasons for the spectrum of differences in the severity of the disease across the population, and in particular why the disease affects more severely the aging population and those with specific preconditions are unclear. We developed machine learning models to mine 240,000 scientific papers openly accessible in the CORD-19 database, and constructed knowledge graphs to synthesize the extracted information and navigate the collective knowledge in an attempt to search for a potential common underlying reason for disease severity. The literature repeatedly pointed to elevated blood glucose as a key facilitator in the progression of COVID-19. Indeed, when we retraced the steps of the SARS-CoV-2 infection we found evidence linking elevated glucose to each step of the life-cycle of the virus, progression of the disease, and presentation of symptoms. Specifically, elevations of glucose provide ideal conditions for the virus to evade and weaken the first level of the immune defense system in the lungs, gain access to deep alveolar cells, bind to the ACE2 receptor and enter the pulmonary cells, accelerate replication of the virus within cells increasing cell death and inducing an pulmonary inflammatory response, which overwhelms an already weakened innate immune system to trigger an avalanche of systemic infections, inflammation and cell damage, a cytokine storm and thrombotic events. We tested the feasibility of the hypothesis by analyzing data across papers, reconstructing atomistically the virus at the surface of the pulmonary airways, and performing quantitative computational modeling of the effects of glucose levels on the infection process. We conclude that elevation in glucose levels can facilitate the progression of the disease through multiple mechanisms and can explain much of the variance in disease severity seen across the population. The study proposes diagnostic recommendations, new areas of research and potential treatments, and cautions on treatment strategies and critical care conditions that induce elevations in blood glucose levels.","Individuals with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have poor ability to adapt to diet-triggered perturbations. We investigated global metabolic responses to a mixed meal test (MMT) in morbidly obese individuals with different diabetic status by performing plasma metabolomic profiling. Abnormal metabolism of carbohydrates, (branched-chain) amino acids, fatty acids and acylcholines in individuals with (pre)diabetes was observed. Moreover, differences in metabolic responses were associated with altered fecal metagenomics and transcriptomes of liver, jejunum and adipose tissues, which revealed a modified gut microbiome and multi-tissue metabolism in individuals having insulin resistance. Finally, using integrative machine learning models, we built a predictive model based on metabolomics data after 2h MMT, and identified possible new biomarkers for glycemic control including N\u2212acetylaspartate and phenylalanine-derived metabolites that may be useful for diagnosis, intervention and prevention of T2DM.","Human lifestyle and physiological variables on human disease risk have been revealed to be mediated by gut microbiota. Low concordance between many case-control studies for detecting disease-associated microbe existed and it is likely due to the limited sample size and the population-wide bias in human lifestyle and physiological variables. To infer association between whole gut microbiota and diseases accurately, we propose to build machine learning models by including both human variables and gut microbiota based on the American Gut Project data, the largest known publicly available human gut bacterial microbiota dataset. When the model's performance with both gut microbiota and human variables is better than the model with just human variables, the independent association of gut microbiota with the disease will be confirmed. We found that gut microbes showed different association strengths with different diseases. Adding gut microbiota into human variables enhanced the association strengths with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and unhealthy status; showed no effect on association strengths with Diabetes and IBS; reduced the association strengths with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, C. difficile infection, lactose intolerance, cardiovascular disease and mental disorders. Our results suggested that although gut microbiota was reported to be associated with many diseases, a considerable proportion of these associations may be spurious. We also proposed a list of microbes as biomarkers to classify IBD and unhealthy status, and validated them by reference to previously published research.","BACKGROUND Recent studies suggest a link between vitamin D deficiency and Covid-19 infection. In our population we observe major differences in Covid-19 incidence in ethnic groups and genders in each group.","Summary: We present a tool, diCal-IBD, for detecting identity-by-descent (IBD) tracts between pairs of genomic sequences. Our method builds on a recent demographic inference method based on the coalescent with recombination, and is able to incorporate demographic information as a prior. Simulation study shows that diCal-IBD has significantly higher recall and precision than that of existing IBD detection methods, while retaining reasonable accuracy for IBD tracts as small as 0.1 cM.","Immunoglobulin A (IgA) mediates mucosal responses to food antigens and the intestinal microbiome and has a known role in susceptibility to mucosal pathogens, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and IgA nephropathy. We performed genetic analyses of serum IgA levels in 41,263 individuals of diverse ancestries. We observed unexpected variability in IgA levels across major ancestral populations, with African ancestry being reproducibly associated with higher serum IgA levels compared to other ancestries. The trans-ethnic GWAS analysis identified 20 genome-wide significant loci associated with serum IgA levels, including nine known and 11 novel loci. Systematic co-localization analysis with blood and primary immune cell expression QTLs prioritized candidate genes for 14 of 20 loci. Most GWAS loci encoded genes that produce immune defects and IgA abnormalities when genetically manipulated in mice. We uncovered positive genetic correlations of serum IgA levels with IgA nephropathy, type 2 diabetes and body mass index, as well as negative genetic correlations with celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, several infections, and intestinal microbiome diversity. Our findings provide novel insights into the genetic regulation of IgA production and its potential role in human disease.","Introduction\nThe United Kingdom's (UK) National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) needs access to evidence on COVID-19 to develop rapid guidelines for healthcare professionals. This paper reports on how the NICE COVID-19 search strategy for identifying references in Ovid MEDLINE and Embase has been developed and maintained.\nMethods\nEach free-text line from the June 2020 version of the NICE COVID-19 search strategy was categorised as Critical, High, Medium, Low or Zero priority, according to the number of results and their relevance to NICE. Five search options were devised and tested by combining them with a search for drug treatments. The two prioritised options were compared to the COVID-19 Limit available in Ovid. New subject headings were tested and added. The selected option was refined to make the strategy simpler to use. \nResults\nThe updated strategy combines free-text terms, categorised as Critical, High and Medium priority for NICE, with appropriate subject headings. \nDiscussion \nThe paper describes the challenges of maintaining a search strategy during the COVID-19 pandemic, as terminology continues to evolve. \nConclusions\nA search strategy for identifying COVID-19 references, within the remit of NICE, has been developed. The recommended strategy could be considered for validation at an appropriate point in the pandemic. It is hoped that understanding how NICE has maintained its COVID-19 strategy will encourage further discussion on the challenges.","Objective\nAcute kidney injury (AKI) considerably increases the risk of short-term mortality in acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) but predicting AKI is not possible with existing tools. Our study aimed at de novo discovery of AKI biomarkers in ACLF.\nDesign\nThis observational study had two phases- (A) Discovery phase in which quantitative proteomics was carried-out with day-of-admission plasma from ACLF patients who initially had no-AKI but progressed to AKI (n=10) or did not progress to AKI (n=9) within 10 days of admission and, (B) Validation phase in which selected biomarkers from the discovery phase were validated by ELISA in a larger set of ACLF plasma samples (n=93) followed by sub-group analyses. \nResults\nPlasma proteomics revealed 56 differentially expressed proteins in ACLF patients who progressed to AKI vs those who did not. The metallothionein protein-family was upregulated in patients who progressed to AKI and was validated by ELISA as significantly elevated in both- (i) ACLF AKI vs no-AKI (p-value\u22640.0001) and (ii) progression to AKI vs no-progression to AKI (p-value\u22640.001). AUROC for AKI vs no-AKI was 0.786 (p-value \u22640.001)  and for progression to AKI vs no-progression to AKI was 0.7888 (p-value \u22640.001). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that ACLF patients with plasma MT concentration &gt;5.83 ng/mL (cut-off defined at 80% specificity and 80% sensitivity) had a high probability of developing AKI by day 7 (p-value \u22640.0001). High expression of metallothionein genes was found in post-mortem liver biopsies of ACLF patients. \nConclusion\nDay-of-admission measurements of plasma metallothionein can act as predictive biomarkers of AKI in ACLF.","Background and objective Vitamin D deficiency is associated with diabetes, cancer, immunological and cardiovascular diseases as well as increased mortality. It has, however, been difficult to show a causal relation in randomized, controlled trials. Mendelian randomization studies provide another option for testing causality, and results indicate relations between the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) level and some diseases, including mortality. We have from the Troms\u00f8 Study in 2012 published non-significant relations been vitamin D related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and mortality, but have since then genotyped additional subjects, the observation time is longer and new SNPs have been included.","Participation in a genetic study likely has a genetic component. Identifying such component is difficult as we cannot compare genetic information of participants with non-participants directly, the latter being unavailable. Here, we show that alleles that are more common in participants than non-participants would be further enriched in genetic segments shared by two related participants. Genome-wide analysis was performed by comparing allele frequencies in shared and not-shared genetic segments of first-degree relative pairs of the UK Biobank. A polygenic score constructed from that analysis, in non-overlapping samples, is associated with educational attainment (P = 2.1 \u00d7 10\u221252), body mass index (P = 1.5 \u00d7 10\u221219), and participation in a dietary study (P = 6.9 \u00d7 10\u221221). Further analysis shows that inclination to participate is a behavioural trait in its own right, and not simply a consequence of other established phenotypes. Understanding the basis of this trait is important for data analyses and the design of future surveys, genetic or otherwise.","Background The National Child and Development Study (1958 British Birth Cohort) follows the lives of over 17 000 people born in a single week in England, Scotland, and Wales. Since the initial recruitment there have been nine sweeps to gather subsequent life-course data, and a Biomedical Sweep (Age 44) \u2013 between Sweeps 6 (Age 42) and 7 (Age 46) \u2013 that has found widespread application in genetic studies. Due to its non-selective recruitment, the survey is frequently used as a representative proxy for the British population in demographic, epidemiological, and medical studies. We examine the effect of attrition on representativeness of female fertility and education length.","Daytime napping is a common, heritable behavior, but its genetic basis and causal relationship with cardiometabolic health remains unclear. Here, we performed a genome-wide association study of self-reported daytime napping in the UK Biobank (n=452,633) and identified 123 loci of which 60 replicated in 23andMe research participants (n=541,333). Findings included missense variants in established drug targets (HCRTR1, HCRTR2), genes with roles in arousal (TRPC6, PNOC), and genes suggesting an obesity-hypersomnolence pathway (PNOC, PATJ). Signals were concordant with accelerometer-measured daytime inactivity duration and 33 signals colocalized with signals for other sleep phenotypes. Cluster analysis identified 3 clusters suggesting distinct nap-promoting mechanisms with heterogeneous associations with cardiometabolic outcomes. Mendelian randomization showed potential causal links between more frequent daytime napping and higher systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and waist circumference.","In this study, we perform a full genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify statistically significantly associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with three red blood cell (RBC) components and follow it with two independent PheWASs to examine associations between phenotypic data (case-control status of diagnoses or disease), significant SNPs, and RBC component levels. We first identified associations between the three RBC components: mean platelet volume (MPV), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and platelet counts (PC), and the genotypes of approximately 500,000 SNPs on the Illumina Infimum\u00ae DNA Human OmniExpress-24 BeadChip using a single cohort of 4,700 Northern Nevadans. Twenty-one SNPs in five major genomic regions were found to be statistically significantly associated with MPV, two regions with MCV, and one region with PC, with p&lt;5x10-8. Twenty-nine SNPs and nine chromosomal regions were identified in 30 previous GWASs, with effect sizes of similar magnitude and direction as found in our cohort. The two strongest associations were SNP rs1354034 with MPV (p=2.4x10-13) and rs855791 with MCV (p=5.2x10-12). We then examined possible associations between these significant SNPs and incidence of 1,488 phenotype groups mapped from International Classification of Disease version 9 and 10 (ICD9 and ICD10) codes collected in the extensive electronic health record (EHR) database associated with Healthy Nevada Project consented participants. Further leveraging data collected in the EHR, we performed an additional PheWAS to identify associations between continuous red blood cell (RBC) component measures and incidence of specific diagnoses. The first PheWAS illuminated whether SNPs associated with RBC components in our cohort were linked with other hematologic phenotypic diagnoses or diagnoses of other nature. Although no SNPs from our GWAS were identified as strongly associated to other phenotypic components, a number of associations were identified with p-values ranging between 1x10-3 and 1x10-4 with traits such as respiratory failure, sleep disorders, hypoglycemia, hyperglyceridemia, GERD and IBS. The second PheWAS examined possible phenotypic predictors of abnormal RBC component measures: a number of hematologic phenotypes such as thrombocytopenia, anemias, hemoglobinopathies and pancytopenia were found to be strongly associated to RBC component measures; additional phenotypes such as (morbid) obesity, malaise and fatigue, alcoholism, and cirrhosis were also identified to be possible predictors of RBC component measures.","Background To constrain propagation and mitigate the burden of COVID-19, most countries initiated and continue to implement several non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including national and regional lockdowns. In the Republic of Ireland, the first national lockdown was decreed on 23rd of March 2020, followed by a succession of restriction increases and decreases (phases) over the the following year. To date, the effects of these interventions remain unclear, and particularly within differing population subsets. The current study sought to assess the impact of individual NPI phases on COVID-19 transmission patterns within delineated population subgroups in the Republic of Ireland.","Background Genome wide association studies (GWAS) of specific diseases are central to scientific discovery. Bias from inevitably recruiting only survivors of genetic make-up and disease specific competing risk has not been comprehensively considered.","Estimating the polygenicity (proportion of causally associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)) and discoverability (effect size variance) of causal SNPs for human traits is currently of considerable interest. SNP-heritability is proportional to the product of these quantities. We present a basic model, using detailed linkage disequilibrium structure from an extensive reference panel, to estimate these quantities from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics. We apply the model to diverse phenotypes and validate the implementation with simulations. We find model polygenicities ranging from \u2243 2 \u00d7 10\u22125 to \u2243 4 \u00d7 10\u22123, with discoverabilities similarly ranging over two orders of magnitude. A power analysis allows us to estimate the proportions of phenotypic variance explained additively by causal SNPs reaching genome-wide significance at current sample sizes, and map out sample sizes required to explain larger portions of additive SNP heritability. The model also allows for estimating residual inflation (or deflation from over-correcting of z-scores), and assessing compatibility of replication and discovery GWAS summary statistics.","  In this essay written with my students and collaborators in mind, I share\nsimple recipes that are easy and often fun to put in practice and that make a\nbig difference in one's life.

This model can be used to make predictions of the propagation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in different spatial scales: from a world scale to a country or even a smaller scale. Predictions on persons hospitalized, number of ventilators needed at ICUs and potential numbers of deaths were successfully carried out in different countries using this approach. This paper shows the mathematical basis for the model together with a proposal for its calibration on the different phases of the epidemic.","Gastrointestinal strongyles are a major threat to horses' health and welfare. Given that strongyles inhabit the same niche as the gut microbiota, they may interact with each other. These beneficial or detrimental interactions are unknown in horses and could partly explain contrasted susceptibility to infection between individuals. To address these questions, an experimental pasture trial with 20 worm-free female Welsh ponies (10 susceptible (S) and 10 resistant (R) to parasite infection) was implemented for five months. Fecal egg counts (FEC), hematological and biochemical data, body weight and gut microbiota composition were studied in each individual after 0, 24, 43, 92 and 132 grazing days.","This study analyzes the link between temperatures and COVID-19 contagions in a sample of Italian regions during the period ranging from February 24 to April 15. To that end, Bayesian Model Averaging techniques are used to analyze the relevance of the temperatures together with a set of additional climate, environmental, demographic, social and policy factors. The robustness of individual covariates is measured through posterior inclusion probabilities. The empirical analysis provides conclusive evidence on the role played by the temperatures given that it appears as the most relevant determinant of contagions. This finding is robust to (i) the prior distribution elicitation, (ii) the procedure to assign weights to the regressors, (iii) the presence of measurement errors in official data due to under-reporting, (iv) the employment of different metrics of temperatures or (v) the inclusion of additional correlates. In a second step, relative importance metrics that perform an accurate partitioning of the R2 of the model are calculated. The results of this approach support the evidence of the model averaging analysis, given that temperature is the top driver explaining 45% of regional contagion disparities. The set of policy-related factors appear in a second level of importance, whereas factors related to the degree of social connectedness or the demographic characteristics are less relevant.","Background Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is frequently accompanied by affective disorders with a prevalence of comorbid depression of around 25%. Nevertheless, the biomarkers of affective symptoms including depression and anxiety due to T2DM are not well established.","Background Serum electrolyte imbalances are highly prevalent in COVID-19 patients. However, their associations with COVID-19 outcomes are inconsistent, and of unknown prognostic value.","The recent wave of biobank repositories linking individual-level genetic data with dense clinical health history has introduced a dramatic paradigm shift in phenotyping for human genetic studies. The mechanism by which biobanks recruit participants can vary dramatically according to factors such as geographic catchment and sampling strategy. These enrollment differences leave an imprint on the cohort, defining the demographics and the utility of the biobank for research purposes. Here we introduce the Michigan Genomics Initiative (MGI), a rolling enrollment, single health system biobank currently consisting of &gt;85,000 participants recruited primarily through surgical encounters at Michigan Medicine. A strong ascertainment effect is introduced by focusing recruitment on individuals in Southeast Michigan undergoing surgery. MGI participants are, on average, less healthy than the general population, which produces a biobank enriched for case counts of many disease outcomes, making it well suited for a disease genetics cohort. A comparison to the much larger UK Biobank, which uses population representative sampling, reveals that MGI has higher prevalence for nearly all diagnosis- code-based phenotypes, and larger absolute numbers of cases for many phenotypes. GWAS of these phenotypes replicate many known findings, validating the genetic and clinical data and their proper linkage. Our results illustrate that single health-system biobanks that recruit participants through opportunistic sampling, such as surgical encounters, produce distinct patient profiles that provide an ideal resource for exploring the genetics of complex diseases.","Kidney stone disease (nephrolithiasis) is a major clinical and economic health burden1,2 with a heritability of ~45-60%3. To identify genetic variants associated with nephrolithiasis we performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and meta-analysis in British and Japanese populations, including 12,123 nephrolithiasis cases and 416,928 controls. Twenty loci associated with nephrolithiasis were identified, ten of which are novel. A novel CYP24A1 locus is predicted to affect vitamin D metabolism and five loci, DGKD, DGKH, WDR72, GPIC1, and BCR, are predicted to influence calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) signaling. In a validation cohort of nephrolithiasis patients the CYP24A1-associated locus correlated with serum calcium concentration and number of kidney stone episodes, and the DGKD-associated locus correlated with urinary calcium excretion. Moreover, DGKD knockdown impaired CaSR-signal transduction in vitro, an effect that was rectifiable with the calcimimetic cinacalcet. Our findings indicate that genotyping may inform risk of incident kidney stone disease prior to vitamin D supplementation and facilitate precision-medicine approaches, by targeting CaSR-signaling or vitamin D activation pathways in patients with recurrent kidney stones."],"title":["Differentiation of Human Colon Tissue In Culture: Effects of calcium on trans-epithelial electrical resistance and tissue cohesive properties","Methylation-derived Inflammatory Measures and Lung Cancer Risk and Survival","Ongoing exposure to peritoneal dialysis fluid alters resident peritoneal macrophage phenotype and activation propensity","Validation of a Novel IoT and AI based Point-of-Care Testing Laboratory: Analytical Accuracy and Clinical Agreement","Targeted sequencing of candidate genes of dyslipidemia in Punjabi Sikhs: Population-specific rare variants in GCKR promote ectopic fat deposition","Changes in dispensing of medicines proposed for re-purposing in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia","Small molecule FGF23 inhibitors increase serum phosphate and improve skeletal abnormalities in Hyp mice","Neurology in a Changing Climate: A Scoping Review","HLA-A*03:01 is associated with increased risk of fever, chills, and more severe reaction to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccination","Retrospective analysis of the use of osteoporosis medication at the presentation of fragility fractures in a predominantly Hispanic population","Identifying the critical time window for the association of the early-life gut microbiome and metabolome with childhood neurodevelopment","The developmental transcriptome of contrasting Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) morphs","Diversity of satellite glia in sympathetic and sensory ganglia","THE INFLUENCE OF HLA GENOTYPE ON SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, AND SEVERITY OF, COVID-19 INFECTION","Severe obesity is associated with higher in-hospital mortality in a cohort of patients with COVID-19 in the Bronx, New York","Vitamin D3 regulates estrogen\u2019s action and affects mammary epithelial organization in 3D cultures","Estimation of causal effects of a time-varying exposure at multiple time points through Multivariable Mendelian randomization","The computational Patient has diabetes and a COVID","Evolution of diapause in the African turquoise killifish by remodeling ancient gene regulatory landscape","Reversal of Epigenetic Age with Diet and Lifestyle in a Pilot Randomized Clinical Trial","The \u201cthrowaways\u201d.

To our knowledge, this concept has not been tested or evaluated in resource-poor settings. This study aimed to explore the acceptability and feasibility of strategies to shield persons at higher risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes, during the COVID-19 epidemic in six communities in Sudan.","Background/Objective There is a paucity of data on the management of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding in patients with COVID-19 amid concerns about the risk of transmission during endoscopic procedures. We aimed to study the outcomes of conservative treatment for GI bleeding in patients with COVID-19.\n","This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of tenofovir (TDF) and TDF combined with emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 infections. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with clinical suspicion of mild to moderate respiratory infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 who were treated at an outpatient clinic. Patients were randomly recruited to take 10 days of TDF (300 mg/day), TDF (300 mg/day) combined with FTC (200 mg/day) or placebo Vitamin C (500 mg/day). The primary parameter was the score of symptoms and predictive signs of COVID-19, assessed on the seventh day of patient follow-up. From a total of 309 patients with clinical suspicion of SARS-CoV-2, 227 met the inclusion criteria and were randomly distributed into the following groups: (a) 75 (one did not initiate treatment) in the TDF group; (b) 74 in the TDF combined with FTC group; and (c) 77 in the Vitamin C group (placebo). Of the 226 patients, 139 (62%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Fever (\u226537.8\u00b0C), ageusia or dysgeusia, anosmia or dysosmia, and two or more clinical symptoms or signs were significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. There was no significant change in clinical score based on clinical symptoms and signs between treatment groups. Patients with mild to moderate infection by SARS-CoV-2 had higher concentrations of G-CSF, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 compared to patients without infection. Patients with mild to moderate respiratory infection, with fever (\u226537.8\u00b0C), loss of smell, loss of taste and two or more symptoms, have a better prediction for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 showed higher and more persistent proinflammatory cytokines profile compared to patients not infected with SARS-CoV-2. Pharmacological intervention with TDF or TDF combined with FTC did not change the clinical signs and symptoms score in mild to moderate respiratory infection in patients with SARS-CoV-2 compared to the Vitamin C group (placebo).","Background Observational studies have suggested associations between circulating antioxidant levels and many mental disorders, but evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is lacking and causal inferences have not been confirmed. The aim of this study was to explore whether genetically predicted diet-derived circulating antioxidants were causally associated with the risk of major mental disorders using Mendelian randomization (MR).","Introduction Previous studies in mostly Western populations, have yielded conflicting findings on the association of vitamin B12 with diabetes risk, in part, due to differences in study design and population characteristics. This study sought to examine the vitamin B12 \u2013 diabetes association in Chinese hypertensive adults by both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses.","The coronavirus has a high basic reproduction number (R0) and has caused the global COVID-19 pandemic. Governments are implementing lockdowns that are leading to economic fallout in many countries. Policy makers can take better decisions if provided with the indicators connected with the disease spread. This study is aimed to cluster the countries using social, economic, health and environmental related metrics affecting the disease spread so as to implement the policies to control the widespread of disease. Thus, countries with similar factors can take proactive steps to fight against the pandemic. The data is acquired for 79 countries and 18 different feature variables (the factors that are associated with COVID-19 spread) are selected. Pearson Product Moment Correlation Analysis is performed between all the feature variables with cumulative death cases and cumulative confirmed cases individually to get an insight of relation of these factors with the spread of COVID-19. Unsupervised k-means algorithm is used and the feature set includes economic, environmental indicators and disease prevalence along with COVID-19 variables. The learning model is able to group the countries into 4 clusters on the basis of relation with all 18 feature variables. We also present an analysis of correlation between the selected feature variables, and COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths. Prevalence of underlying diseases shows strong correlation with COVID-19 whereas environmental health indicators are weakly correlated with COVID-19.","Our COVID-19 drug candidate ARTIVeda\u2122/PulmoHeal is a novel gelatin capsule formulation of the Artemisia extract Ayurveda for oral delivery of TGF-\u03b2 targeting anti-malaria phytomedicine Artemisinin with documented anti-inflammatory and anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Here we report the safety and efficacy of ARTIVeda\u2122 in adult COVID-19 patients with symptomatic mild-moderate COVID-19, who were treated in a randomized, open-label Phase IV study in Bangalore, Karnataka, India (Clinical Trials Registry India identifier: CTRI/2020/09/028044). ARTIVeda showed a very favorable safety profile, and the only ARTIVeda-related adverse events were transient mild rash and mild hypertension. Notably, ARTIVeda, when added to the SOC, accelerated the recovery of patients with mild-moderate COVID-19. While all patients were symptomatic at baseline (WHO score = 2-4), 31 of 39 (79.5%) of patients treated with ARTIVeda plus SOC became asymptomatic (WHO score = 1) by the end of the 5-day therapy, including 10 of 10 patients with severe dry cough 7 of 7 patients with severe fever. By comparison, 12 of 21 control patients (57.1%) treated with SOC alone became asymptomatic on day 5 (P=0.028, Fisher\u2019s exact test). This clinical benefit was particularly evident when the treatment outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients (WHO score = 4) treated with SOC alone versus SOC plus ARTIVeda were compared. The median time to becoming asymptomatic was only 5 days for the SOC plus ARTIVeda group (N=18) but 14 days for the SOC alone group (N=10) (P=0.004, Log-rank test). These data provide clinical proof of concept that targeting the TGF-\u03b2 pathway with ARTIVeda may contribute to a faster recovery of patients with mild-moderate COVID-19 when administered early in the course of their disease.","Objectives COVID-19 patients suffer from the lack of curative therapy. Hence, there is an urgent need to try repurposed old drugs on COVID-19.","Background Risk factors for severe COVID-19 include older age, male sex, obesity, Black or Asian ethnicity and underlying medical conditions. Whether these factors also influence susceptibility to developing COVID-19 is uncertain.","Background Exposure to O3 has been associated with increased risk of exacerbations of asthma, but the underlying mechanisms are not well studied. We hypothesized that O3 exposure would enhance airway inflammatory responses to allergen and the GSTM1 null genotype would modulate this enhancement.","Objectives To examine heterogeneity of outcomes in protocols of clinical trials of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to identify outcomes for prioritization in developing a core outcome set (COS) in this field.","University students are a vulnerable group for poor dietary intake, insufficient physical activity and sedentary behaviour. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of COVID-19 on university students\u2019 dietary intake, physical activity and sedentary behaviour. Participants were students (n=125) from the Universities of Saskatchewan and Regina. An online questionnaire was administered retrospectively (for pre-pandemic) and prospectively (during the pandemic) to examine students\u2019 dietary intake, physical activity and sedentary behaviour. Overall, nutrient and caloric intakes were significantly reduced (p&lt;0.05) during the pandemic, and alcohol intake increased (p=0.03). Before the pandemic, 16% and 54% of the participants were meeting the Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines for Adults (18\u201364 years) of 150 minutes of moderate-vigorous physical activity and 8 hours or less of sedentary activity respectively. Only 10% met the guidelines for physical activity while 30% met the guidelines for sedentary behaviour during the pandemic. The minutes per week spent engaging in moderate to vigorous physical activity during the pandemic decreased by approximately 20% (p&lt;0.001). The hours spent in sedentary activities increased by 3 hours per day (p&lt;0.001). Our findings confirm that during the pandemic, students\u2019 inadequate dietary intake, high alcohol consumption, low physical activity and high sedentary behaviour were significantly compounded.","","Aim To evaluate associations of plasma 25(OH)D status with the likelihood of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection and hospitalization.","Introduction Indomethacin, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), has been presented as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent. This randomised clinical trial in a hospital setting evaluated the efficacy and safety of this drug in RT-PCR-positive coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.","This paper aimed to give the visibility of Latin American researchers\u2019 contributions to the comprehension of COVID-19; our method was a literature review. Currently, the world is facing a health and socioeconomic crisis caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, and its disease COVID-19. Therefore, in less than four months, researchers have published a significant number of articles related to this novel virus. For instance, a search focused on the Scopus database on April 10, 2020, showed 1224 documents published by authors with 1797 affiliations from 80 countries. 25.4%, 24.0%, and 12.6% of these national affiliations were from China, Europe, and the USA, respectively, making these regions leaders in COVID-19 research. In the case of Latin America, on April 10, 2020, we searched different databases, such as Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science, finding that the contribution of this region was 2.7\u00b10.6% of the total publications found. In other words, we found 153 publications related to COVID-19 with at least one Latin American researcher. We summarized and processed the information from these 153 publications, finding active participation in topics like medical, social, and environmental considerations, bioinformatics, and epidemiology.","","Manipulations to set back biological age and extend lifespan in animal models are well established, and translation to humans has begun. The length of human life makes it impractical to evaluate results by plotting mortality curves, so surrogate markers of age have been suggested and, at present, the best established surrogates are DNA methylation clocks. Herein we report on a randomized, controlled clinical trial designed to be a first step in evaluating the effect of a diet and lifestyle intervention on biological age. Compared to participants in the control group (n=20), participants in the treatment group tested an average 3.23 years younger at the end of the eight-week program according to the Horvath DNAmAge clock (p=0.018). Those in the treatment group (n=18) tested an average 1.96 years younger at the end of the program compared to the same individuals at the beginning with a strong trend towards significance (p=0.066 for within group change). This is the first such trial to demonstrate a potential reversal of biological age. In this study, the intervention was confined to diet and lifestyle changes previously identified as safe to use. The prescribed program included multiple components with documented mechanistic activity on epigenetic pathways, including moderate exercise, breathing exercises for stress, and a diet rich in methyl donor nutrients and polyphenols.","Background SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of the COVID-19 that has been declared a global pandemic by the WHO in 2020. The COVID-19 treatment guidelines vary in each country, and yet there is no approved therapeutic for COVID-19.","Introduction With over 87,273,380 cases being reported and 1,899,440 deaths worldwide as of 9th January 2021, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become the worst-hit pandemic till date. Every day clinicians are bombarded with many new treatment options that claim to be better than the others.","","Objective To measure and map research output on Quaternary Prevention (P4) and outline research trends; to assess the papers content, mainly regarding methods and subjects approached in order to contribute to the improvement of global knowledge about P4 and to evaluate its relevance for public health.","","Background Particulate matter (PM) pollutant exposure, which induces oxidative stress and inflammation, and vitamin D insufficiency, which compromises immune regulation, are detrimental in asthma.","","In 2010, the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) started the Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-be (nuMoM2b), a prospective cohort study of a racially/ethnically/geographically diverse population of nulliparous women with singleton gestation. The nuMoM2b is a very large dataset, consisting of data for 10,038 patients with over 4,600 features per patient, spread out over 80 files. In this report, we share our experience preparing and working with this dataset. We present our data preprocessing of the nuMoM2b dataset to get a deeper understanding of the data, extract the most relevant features, make the fewest assumptions when filling in unknown values, and reducing the dimensionality of the data. We hope this report is useful to researchers interested in building machine learning and statistical models from the nuMoM2b dataset.","Elucidating the mechanism of reprogramming is confounded by heterogeneity due to the low efficiency and differential kinetics of obtaining induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from somatic cells. Therefore, we increased the efficiency with a novel combination of epigenetic and signaling molecules and profiled the transcriptomes of individual reprogramming cells. Contrary to the established temporal order, somatic gene inactivation and upregulation of cell cycle, epithelial, and early pluripotency genes can be triggered independently such that any combination of these events can occur in single cells. Sustained co-expression of Epcam, Nanog, and Sox2 with other genes is required to progress towards iPSCs. Ehf, Phlda2, and translation initiation factor Eif4a1 play novel functional roles in robust iPSC generation. Using regulatory network analysis, we identify a critical role for signaling inhibition by 2i in repressing somatic expression and synergy between the epigenetic modifiers ascorbic acid and a Dot1L inhibitor for pluripotency gene activation.","Microbial communities from harsh environments hold great promise as sources of biotechnologically-relevant strains. In the present work, we have deeply characterized the microorganisms from three different rocky locations of the Mediterranean coast, an environment characterised by being subjected to harsh conditions such as high levels of irradiation and large temperature and salinity fluctuations. Through culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques, we have retrieved a complete view of the ecology and functional aspects of these communities and assessed the biotechnological potential of the cultivable microorganisms. A culture-independent approach through high-throughput 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing revealed that all three locations display very similar microbial communities, suggesting that there is a stable community associated to the sampled region, with Stanieria cyanosphaera, Rubrobacter sp. and the families Flammeovirgaceae, Phyllobacteriaceae, Rhodobacteraceae and Trueperaceae being the most abundant taxa. Furthermore, shotgun metagenomic sequencing results were in concordance with the high-thoughput 16S rRNA, and allowed a description of the eukaryotic and archaeal members of the community, which were abundant in Ascomycota and halotolerant archaea, respectively. The culture-dependent approach yielded a collection of 100 isolates (mainly pigmented), out of which 12 displayed high antioxidant activities, as proved with two in vitro (hydrogen peroxide and DPPH) and an in vivo (model organism C. elegans) assays.","Objective The study intended to understand the effect of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on western Indian elderly care homes. The study aimed to know the actions taken by administration of homes and challenges faced during the lockdown period.","The confirmed number of SARS-CoV-2 infections up to 30 August 2021 is 217 mil. worldwide but information about factors affecting the probability of infection or of a severe course of Covid-19 remains insufficient and often speculative. Only a small number of factors have been rigorously examined, mostly by retrospective or cross-sectional studies. We ran a preregistered study on 5,164 internet users who shared with us information about their exposure to 105 risk factors and reported being Covid negative before the beginning of the fourth wave of Covid-19 in the Czech Republic. After the fourth wave, in which 709 (13.7%) of participants were infected, we used a partial Kendall test controlled for sex, age, and urbanisation to compare the risk of infection and of a severe course of the disease in subjects who originally did and did not report exposure to particular risk factors. After the correction for multiple tests, we identified 13 factors \u2013 including male sex, lower age, blood group B, and the larger household size \u2013 that increased the risk of infection and 16 factors \u2013 including mask wearing, borreliosis in the past, use of vitamin D supplements, or rooibos drinking \u2013 that decreased it. We also identified 23 factors that increased the risk of a severe course of Covid-19 and 12 factors that decreased the risk.","Objective To assess knowledge, beliefs, and behaviors concerning COVID-19 among Guatemalan, Marshallese, and Amish populations in rural Ohio; identify individual, interpersonal, community, and structural level challenges within each community; and provide population-specific recommendations to prevent and mitigate further SARS-CoV-2 transmission among these rural communities.","Background Vitamin D levels have been reported to be associated with COVID-19 susceptibility, severity and mortality events.. We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the use of vitamin D intervention on COVID-19 outcomes.","Objective To evaluate the efficacy of ivermectin (IVM) as an addition to the standard of care (SOC) treatment in COVID-19 patients with mild and moderate disease","The coronaviral pandemic is exerting a tremendously detrimental impact on global health, quality of life and the world economy, emphasizing the need for effective medications for current and future coronaviral outbreaks as a complementary approach to vaccines. The Spike protein, responsible for cell receptor binding and viral internalization, possesses multiple disulfide bonds raising the possibility that disulfide-reducing agents might disrupt Spike function, prevent viral entry and serve as effective drugs against SARS-CoV-2. Here we show the first experimental evidence that reagents capable of reducing disulfide bonds can inhibit viral infection in cell-based assays. Molecular dynamics simulations of the Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) predict increased domain flexibility when the four disulfide bonds of the domain are reduced. This flexibility is particularly prominent for the surface loop, comprised of residues 456-490, which interacts with the Spike cell receptor ACE2. Consistent with this finding, the addition of exogenous disulfide bond reducing agents affects the RBD secondary structure, lowers its melting temperature from 52 to 36-39\u00b0C and decreases its binding affinity to ACE2 by two orders of magnitude at 37\u00b0C. Finally, the reducing agents dithiothreitol (DTT) and tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) inhibit viral replication at high \u00b5M \u2013 low mM levels with a negligible effect on cell viability at these concentrations. The antiviral effect of monothiol-based reductants N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and reduced glutathione (GSH) was not observed due to decreases in cell viability. Our research demonstrates the clear potential for medications that disrupt Spike disulfides as broad-spectrum anticoronaviral agents and as a first-line defense against current and future outbreaks.","Leptin is a body weight regulatory hormone, but it is arguably even more potent at regulating blood glucose levels. To further our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which leptin controls glucose homeostasis, we have used transgenic zebrafish models and conditional deletion of beta catenin in the mediobasal hypothalamus of adult mice to show that Wnt signalling in the brain mediates glucoregulatory effects of leptin. In zebrafish, under normal feeding conditions, leptin regulates glucose homeostasis but not adipostasis. In times of nutrient excess, we found that leptin also regulates body weight and size in this species. Using a Wnt signalling reporter fish, we show that leptin directly activates the canonical Wnt pathway in vivo. Pharmacological inhibition of this pathway prevented the leptin-induced improvement in glucose tolerance. In adult mice, conditional deletion of the key Wnt effector molecule, \u03b2-catenin, in the mediobasal hypothalamus of male mice confirmed the essential role of the Wnt pathway in mediating leptin action and the neuroendocrine regulation of glucose homeostasis. Adult-onset \u03b2-catenin deletion in the mediobasal hypothalamus led to glucose intolerance, exacerbation of caloric intake and body weight gain under high fat diet, as well as resistance to exogenous leptin.","BACKGROUND A key trial (NCT04308668) of post-exposure prophylaxis found hydroxychloroquine-associated (HCQ) reductions of Covid-19 by 17% overall and 31% to 49% in subgroups. To understand these trends, we re-analyzed the dataset.","Background Many nutrients have powerful immunomodulatory actions with the potential to alter susceptibility to COVID-19 infection, progression to symptoms, likelihood of severe disease and survival. The pandemic has fostered many nutrition-related theories, sometimes backed by a biased interpretation of evidence.","Objective We aimed to compare the safety and efficacy of a doxycycline-based regimen against the national standard guidelines (Hydroxychloroquine plus Azithromycin) for the treatment of mild symptomatic COVID-19.","Background COVID-19 is associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms including increased depressive, anxiety and chronic fatigue-syndrome (CFS)-like physiosomatic (previously known as psychosomatic) symptoms.","Although a vast knowledge has already been gathered on the pathophysiology of COVID-19, there are still limited, non-optimal treatment options. In this paper, we describe a multicentre, retrospective, observational study to describe the course of SARS-CoV-2 disease in patients treated with ImmunoFormulation (IF), an add-on therapy developed to decrease duration of clinical symptoms. In parallel, a group of patients that did not receive IF was used for comparison (using standard of care treatment). A total of 39 patients were evaluated. Throughout the observational period, 90% of patients recovered in the IF cohort and 47.4% in the Control cohort (p=0.0057). From the symptoms with statistically significant differences, the duration of symptoms (i.e., the time to recover from it) was shorter in the IF cohort than in control cohort (in days, average), especially for fever (2.25 x 21.78), dry cough (4.38 x 24.00), dyspnoea (3.67 x 20.00), headache (2.00 x 26.50), diarrhoea (5.25 x 25.25), and weakness (1.92 x 23.30). This demonstrates a potential promising role of IF as adjuvant therapy on the evolution of symptomatology to COVID-19 patients.","The developing brain is especially vulnerable to infection and suboptimal nutrition during the pre- and early postnatal periods. Exposure to maternal HIV infection and antiretroviral therapies (ART) in utero and during breastfeeding can adversely influence infant (neuro)developmental trajectories. How early life nutrition may be optimised to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes for infants who are HIV/ART-exposed has not been well characterised. We conducted an up-to-date evidence review and meta-analysis on the influence of HIV exposure in utero and during breastfeeding, and early life nutrition, on infant neurodevelopmental outcomes before age three. We report that exposure to maternal HIV infection/ART may adversely influence expressive language development, in particular, and these effects may be detectable within the first three years of life. Further, while male infants may be especially vulnerable to HIV/ART exposure, few studies overall reported sex-comparisons, and whether there are sex-dependent effects of HIV exposure on neurodevelopment remains a critical knowledge gap to fill. Lastly, early life nutrition interventions, including daily maternal multivitamin supplementation during the perinatal period, may improve neurodevelopmental outcomes for infants who are HIV-exposed. Our findings suggest that the early nutritional environment may be leveraged to improve early neurodevelopmental trajectories in infants who have been exposed to HIV in utero. A clear understanding of how this environment should be optimised is key for developing targeted nutrition interventions during critical developmental periods in order to mitigate adverse outcome later in life, and should be a priority of future research.","This work details the study of critical containment zones in Maharashtra within a time (April 9 2020 - July 31 2020) in the context of COVID-19. The effects of lockdown implementation, community isolation, environmental factors, demographic aspects, behavioural factors, diet etc. have been investigated. The effect of the aforementioned factors on the infected cases, cumulative infected cases, recoveries, cumulative recoveries, active cases, deaths and cumulative deaths are analyzed. The integrated effects of the aforementioned factors on COVID-19 outcomes are further amplified due to adequate and inadequate health facilities. The study will be helpful to scientists, researchers, pharmacists and biotechnologists in new vaccine design &amp; to accommodate above factors for the betterment of susceptible &amp; infected people of Maharashtra and similar demographies across the globe. Further, it pinpoints the need for more awareness and control strategies among the people to reduce the havoc, stress, fear, anxiety, pathogenicity and thereby reducing mortality.","Over 95% of the COVID-19 cases are mild-to-asymptomatic who contribute to disease transmission whereas most of the severe manifestations of the disease are observed in elderly and in patients with comorbidities and dysregulation of immune response has been implicated in severe clinical outcomes. However, it is unclear whether asymptomatic or mild infections are due to low viral load or lack of inflammation. We have measured the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the respiratory samples and serum markers of inflammation in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms. We observed a bi-phasic pattern of virus load which was eventually cleared in most patients at the time of discharge. Viral load in saliva samples from a subset of patients showed good correlation with nasopharyngeal samples. Serum interferon levels were downregulated during early stages of infection but peaked at later stages correlating with elevated levels of T-cell cytokines and other inflammatory mediators such as IL-6 and TNF- \u03b1 which showed a bi-phasic pattern. The clinical recovery of patients correlated with decrease in viral load and increase in interferons and other cytokines which indicates an effective innate and adaptive immune function in mild infections. We further characterized one of the SARS-CoV-2 isolate by plaque purification and show that infection of lung epithelial cells (Calu-3) with this isolate led to cytopathic effect disrupting epithelial barrier function and tight junctions. Finally we showed that zinc was capable of inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection in this model suggesting a beneficial effect of zinc supplementation in COVID-19 infection.","Background Observational studies have demonstrated inverse associations between vegetable intake and cardiovascular diseases. However, the results are prone to residual confounding. The separate effects of cooked and raw vegetable intake remain unclear. This study aims to investigate the association between cooked and raw vegetable intake with cardiovascular outcomes using Mendelian randomization (MR).","Background SARS-CoV-2 entry into type II pneumocytes is depended on the TMPRSS2 proteolytic enzyme. The only known promoter of TMPRSS2 in humans is an androgen response element. As such, androgen sensitivity may be a risk factor for COVID-19. Previously, we have reported a retrospective cohort analysis demonstrating the protective effect of 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (5ARis) in COVID-19. Men using 5ARis were less likely to be admitted to the ICU than men not taking 5ARis. Additionally, men using 5ARis had drastically reduced frequency of symptoms compared to men not using 5ARis in an outpatient setting. Here we aim to determine if 5ARis will be a beneficial treatment if given after SARS-CoV-2 infection.","The present study was conducted to assess the behavioral preventive measures and the use of medicines and herbal foods/products among the public in response to Covid-19. A cross-sectional survey was conducted from 27 June to 20 July 2020, and 1222 people participated. Kruskal-Wallis test was used to identify the differences in behavioral preventive practices across different demographic categories. To identify the factors associated with the use of preventive medicines and herbal foods/products, multivariable logistic regression was performed. Most participants adopted the recommended preventive practices such as washing hands more frequently (87.5%), staying home more often (85.5%), avoiding crowds (86%), and wearing masks (91.6%). About half of the smokers reported a decreased rate of smoking during the pandemic. Also, 14.8% and 57.6% of the participants took medicines and herbal foods/products as preventive measures against Covid-19. Arsenicum album and Zinc supplements were the most commonly used preventive medicines. Gender, age, and fear of Covid-19 were significantly associated with the use of both preventive medicines and herbal products. For the management of Covid-19 related symptoms, Paracetamols, Fexofenadine, and Zinc supplements were used most often. Most participants sought information from non-medical sources while using medicines and herbal products. Moreover, potentially inappropriate and unnecessary use of drugs were identified.","Background The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has disproportionately impacted the Latinx community in the United States. Environmental risk factors, including community level pollution burden and exposure to smoking and secondhand smoke, have not been evaluated in relation to risk for infection with COVID-19.","New information is emerging about SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology and immunity, but little of this information comes from low- and middle-income countries or from patients receiving care in the outpatient setting. The current study investigated the SARS-CoV-2 infection status and antibody responses in 157 patients seeking care for a respiratory disease suggestive of COVID-19 in private healthcare clinics during the first wave (June\u2013October 2020) of infections in Nicaragua. We examined nasal swabs for the presence of viral RNA via RT-PCR and longitudinally collected sera for the changes in SARS-CoV-2 Spike antibody levels over six months. Among patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, we evaluated if clinical symptoms were associated with age, hematological parameters and co-morbidities. The combination of PCR and paired serology identified 60 (38%) of the 157 outpatients as acute COVID-19. While both PCR and serology identified the majority (n = 38, 64%) of the acute infections, a notable number of outpatients were identified by RT-qPCR (n = 13, 22%) or by serology (n = 9, 14%) only. During the longitudinal study, we identified 6 new infections by serology among the 97 non-COVID-19 subjects. In conclusion, this study report that more than one third of the outpatients seeking care for acute respiratory disease during the first epidemic wave of SARS-CoV-2 in Nicaragua had an acute mild COVID-19 infection that correlate with prolonged humoral response. This immune response to the RBD antigen, more likely IgG dependent, significantly increased between the acute to convalescent and decay in the late convalescent but still remained seropositive.","Lycium barbarum, commonly known as goji berry, Chinese berry, or Tibetian berry, is emerging as a popular \u201csuperfood\u201d with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Goji berry is being used for the treatment of various cancers, gastrointestional disorders, stroke, diabetes, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and glaucoma. However, its use for management of oral inflammatory diseases has not been explored. Therefore, the present study aims to evaluate the antimicrobial, anti-adhesion, and anti-biofilm, and cytotoxic properties of an ethanolic extract of Lycium barbarum (LBE) against oral and periodontal pathogens. The antimicrobial properties of LBE against five microorganisms were tested and compared against Chlorhexidine and doxycycline along with cytotoxicity and cell viability on the gingival fibroblast and modified keratinocyte cell lines. The anti-adhesion and anti-biofilm properties of LBE against Porphyromonas gingivalis, at its minimal bactericidal value, were evaluated. The antimicrobial, anti-adhesion and antibiofilm properties of LBE were found to be comparable to chlorhexidine but less than that of doxycycline. The LBE extract was also compactible to gingival fibroblast tissues and oral keratinocytes at 1 mg/ml. The results proved that goji berry is as effective as chlorhexidine and can be used as a promising natural herb for the management of inflammatory diseases of oral cavity.","Objectives Maternal nutrition plays a crucial role in influencing fetal growth and birth outcomes. The government of Indonesia has provided a manufactured fortified food supplementation program for undernourished pregnant mothers. We hypothesized a low-cost local food supplementation (LFS) would improve maternal and birth outcomes compared with government food supplementation (GFS).","Background/Objectives Physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) represents the total volume of all physical activity. This can be accumulated as different underlying intensity profiles. Although volume and intensity have been studied in isolation, less is known about their joint association with health. We examined this association with body-fatness in a population-based sample of middle-aged British women and men.","Background and Purpose Vitamin A is depleted during infections. Vitamin A has been used successfully in measles, RSV and AIDS patients and is an effective vaccine adjuvant. In this study, low retinol levels were found in patients with severe COVID-19. Retinoid signaling impairment in COVID-19 disrupts Type-I interferon synthesis.","The impact of nutrition on the metabolic profile of osteoporosis is incompletely characterized. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to detangle the association of fruit and vegetable (FV) intakes with osteoporosis prevalence. Dietary, anthropometric and blood plasma metabolite data were examined from the Boston Puerto Rican Osteoporosis Study, a cohort of 600 individuals (age 46-79yr). High FV intake was protective against osteoporosis prevalence. Associations of 525 plasma metabolites were assessed with fruit and vegetable intake, and separately with osteoporosis status. Several biological processes affiliated with the FV-associating metabolites, including caffeine metabolism, carnitines and fatty acids, and glycerophospholipids. For osteoporosis-associated metabolites, important processes were steroid hormone biosynthesis in women, and branched-chain amino acid metabolism in men. In all instances, the metabolite patterns differed greatly between sexes, arguing for a stratified nutrition approach in recommending FV intakes to improve bone health. Factors derived from principal components analysis of the FV intakes were correlated with the osteoporosis-associated metabolites, with high intake of dark leafy greens and berries/melons appearing protective in both sexes. These data warrant investigation into whether increasing intakes of dark leafy greens, berries and melons causally affect bone turnover and BMD among adults at risk for osteoporosis via sex-specific metabolic pathways, and how gene-diet interactions alter these sex-specific metabolomic-osteoporosis links.","Background The novel corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been causing a massive global public health havoc. Use of quinolones for treatment of COVID-19 was a matter of huge discussion in scientific community. Falsified data about efficacy of the drug against COVID-19 disseminated. This review was designed to study the dosages of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine planned to be administered in clinical trials registered up to March 2020.","Background Private retail pharmacies in developing countries present a unique channel for COVID-19 prevention. We assessed the response to the COVID-19 pandemic by pharmacies in Kenya, aiming to identify strategies for maximising their contribution to the national response.","Background Small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (SQ-LNS) have been shown to reduce the prevalence of anemia and iron deficiency among infants and young children, but effects on other micronutrients are less well known. Identifying subgroups who may experience greater benefits from SQ-LNS, or who are more likely to respond to the intervention, may facilitate the development of public health policies and programs.","Background Based on systematic literature reviews, the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) Global Burden of Disease (GBD) landmark risk factor paper attributes about 8 million noncommunicable diseases deaths/year to a composite of 15 dietary risk factors. Another 27 million noncommunicable deaths out of 56.5 million total deaths worldwide are attributed to high levels of metabolic risk factors.","The development of new approaches that allow early assessment of which cases of COVID-19 will likely become critical and the discovery of new therapeutic targets are urgent demands. In this cohort study, we performed proteomic and laboratorial profiling of plasma from 163 patients admitted to Bauru State Hospital (Bauru, SP, Brazil) between May 4th and July 4th, 2020, who were diagnosed with COVID-19 by RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab samples. Plasma samples were collected upon admission for routine laboratory analyses and shotgun quantitative label-free proteomics. Based on the course of the disease, the patients were further divided into 3 groups: a) mild symptoms, discharged without admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) (n=76); b) severe symptoms, discharged after admission to an ICU (n=56); c) critical, died after admission to an ICU (n=31). White cells and neutrophils were significantly higher in severe and critical patients compared to mild ones. Lymphocytes were significantly lower in critical patients compared to mild ones and platelets were significantly lower in critical patients compared to mild and severe ones. Ferritin, TGO, urea and creatinine were significantly higher in critical patients compared to mild and severe ones. Albumin, CPK, LDH and D-dimer were significantly higher in severe and critical patients compared to mild ones. PCR was significantly higher in severe patients compared to mild ones. Proteomic analysis revealed marked changes between the groups in plasma proteins related to complement activation, blood coagulation, antimicrobial humoral response, acute inflammatory response, and endopeptidase inhibitor activity. Higher levels of IREB2, GELS, POLR3D, PON1 and ULBP6 upon admission to hospital were found in patients with mild symptoms, while higher levels of Gal-10 were found in critical and severe patients. This needs to be validated in further studies. If confirmed, pathways involving these proteins might be potential new therapeutic targets for COVID-19.","","The brain-gut axis is increasingly recognized as an important contributing factor in the onset and progression of severe mental illnesses such as schizophrenia spectrum disorders and bipolar disorder. This study investigates associations between levels of faecal metabolites identified using 1H-NMR, clinical parameters, and dietary components of forty-two individuals diagnosed in a transdiagnostic approach to have severe mental illness. Faecal levels of the amino acids; alanine, leucine, and valine showed a significant positive correlation with psychiatric symptom severity as well as with dairy intake. Overall, this study proposes a diet-induced link between the brain-gut axis and the severity of psychiatric symptoms, which could be valuable in the design of novel dietary or therapeutic interventions to improve psychiatric symptoms.","Background COVID-19 is a global health emergency. Recent data indicate a 50% mortality rate across UK intensive care units.","Objective Cytokine storm and Coagulopathy have been implicated as major causes of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. A black yeast Aureobasidium pullulans AFO-202 strain produced beta 1,3-1,6 glucan has been reported to offer potential immune enhancement and metabolism balancing, as well as mitigation of coagulopathy risks. The N-163 strain produced beta glucan is an efficient anti-inflammatory immune modulator. In this pilot clinical study, we report the beneficial effects of these two beta glucans on the biomarkers for cytokine storm and coagulopathy in COVID-19 patients.","","Thinking one is better than peers is generally associated with positive psychological outcomes like increased self-esteem and resilience. However, this tendency may be problematic in the context of collective action problems, wherein individuals are reliant on others\u2019 prosocial behaviors to achieve larger goals. We examined this question in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, and recruited participants (n = 1022) from a university community in Spring 2020. We found evidence for a self-peer asymmetry, such that participants reported that they were doing more to stop the spread of the disease and were more prosocially motivated than peers. Actual peer reports indicated that these were overestimations. This self-enhancement tendency comes with a cost: the perceived self-peer asymmetry mediated the relationship between Covid-specific worry and general anxiety during the early lockdown period. This indicates that while believing one is doing more than others may be maladaptive in collective action problems.","Background To assess the iron status among children aged 5\u201310 years","A total of 6,628 PUBMED-registered publications on the relationships between the effects of vaccination and the provision of micronutrients have been studied by methods of topological analysis of text data. In case of insufficient intake of certain micronutrients, the functioning of the acquired immunity is disrupted resulting in an imbalance of populations of T-cells CD4+/CD8+ and of B-lymphocytes. Nutritional supplements of folate, vitamins A, D and B12, which are recognized regulators of cell division, support a wide range of lymphocyte populations. Trace elements zinc, iron, selenium, manganese and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are also important for supporting the mechanisms of acquired immunity. The data presented show that a course intake of these micronutrients by patients planning vaccination can significantly improve its effectiveness. In particular, these micronutrients can increase the titers of antibodies to pathogens, and to reduce the percentage of patients who still contract infection after vaccination. Supplements of these micronutrients can also contribute to the safety of vaccination: to prevent malaise and, in the unfortunate case of contracting infection despite the vaccine, to reduce the severity of the course and the mortality from the corresponding infection.","Background Long COVID has been a social concern. Though patient characteristics associated with developing long COVID are partially known, those associated with persisting it have not been identified.","Objective To evaluate the efficacy and safety of PNB001 a CCK-A agonist and CCK-B antagonist, a new chemical entity with anti-inflammatory and immune stimulation properties, along with Standard of Care (SOC) in patients with moderate COVID-19 infection.","","Background AYUSH formulations have a potential role in symptomatic treatment, preventing disease progression and improving quality of life in COVID-19 patients.","Rationale In late December 2019, an outbreak of acute respiratory illness, now officially named as COVID-19, or coronavirus disease 2019, emerged in Wuhan, China, now spreading across the whole country and world. More data were needed to understand the clinical characteristics of the disease.","Objective To provide diagnostic evidence and clues for patients with fever of unknown origin (FUO) through urine proteomics analysis.","  It is known that the primary source of dietary vitamin C is fruit and\nvegetables and the plasma level of vitamin C has been considered a good\nsurrogate biomarker of vitamin C intake by fruit and vegetable consumption. To\ncombine the information about association between vitamin C intake and the\nplasma level of vitamin C, numerical approximation methods for likelihood\nfunction of correlation coefficient are studied. The least squares approach is\nused to estimate a log-likelihood function by a function from a space of\nB-splines having desirable mathematical properties. The likelihood interval\nfrom the Highest Likelihood Regions (HLR) is used for further inference. This\napproach can be easily extended to the realm of meta-analysis involving sample\ncorrelations from different studies by use of an approximated combined\nlikelihood function. The sample correlations between vitamin C intake and serum\nlevel of vitamin C from many studies are used to illustrate application of this\napproach.\n","Objective This living systematic review aims to provide a timely, rigorous and continuously updated summary of the evidence available on the role of vitamin C in the treatment of patients with COVID-19.","Background In the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, many hospitalized patients received empiric hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine (HC/CQ). Although some retrospective-observational trials suggested potential benefit, all subsequent randomized clinical trials (RCTs) failed to show benefit and use generally ceased. Herein, we summarize key studies that clinicians advising patients on HC/CQ\u2019s efficacy:safety calculus in hospitalized COVID-19 patients would want to know about in a practical one-stop-shopping source.","We aimed to analyze and visualize the science map of Cochrane systematic reviews (CSR) with high Altmetric attention scores (AAS). On 10 May 2019, the Altmetric data of the CSR Database were obtained from the Altmetric database (Altmetric LLP, London, UK). Bibliometric data of the top 5% of CSR were extracted from the Web of Science. Keyword co-occurrence, co-authorship, and co-citation network analysis were then employed using VOSviewer software. A Random forest model was used to analyze the citation patterns. A total of 12016 CSR with AAS were found (Total mentions: 259968) with Twitter being the most popular Altmetric resource. Consequently, the top 5% (607 articles, mean AAS: 171.2, 95% confidence level (CL): 14.4, mean citations: 42.1, 95%CL: 1.3) with the highest AAS were included in the study. Keyword co-occurrence network analysis revealed female, adult, and child as the most popular keywords. Helen V. Worthington (University of Manchester, Manchester, UK), and the University of Oxford and UK had the greatest impact on the network at the author, organization and country levels respectively. The co-citation network analysis revealed that The Lancet and CSR database had the most influence on the network. However, AAS were not correlated with citations (r=0.15) although they were correlated with policy document mentions (r=0.61). The results of random forest model confirmed the importance of policy document mentions. Despite the popularity of CSR in the Twittersphere, disappointingly, they were rarely shared and discussed within the new academic tools that are emerging, such as F1000 prime, Publons, and PubPeer.","Background Global knowledge of treatment and outcomes of COVID-19 has been evolving since the onset of the pandemic.","Background As mother-to-child-transmission of HIV decreases, and the population of infants who are born HIV-exposed, but uninfected (HEU) continues to rise, there is growing need to understand the development and health outcomes of infants who are HEU to ensure that they have the healthiest start to life.","Objectives To compare the co-administration of an Ayurvedic drug AYUSH 64 as an adjunct to standard of care (SOC) and SOC for efficacy and safety in the management of COVID-19.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus. There are three phases of COVID-19: early infection stage, pulmonary stage and hyper-inflammation stage respectively. It is important to prevent lung or other organs injuries by preventing phase-II and phase-III via pharmacological or non-pharmacological treatments. This was a case series study done on twenty-two patients confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and diagnosed with COVID-19. Patients in this study have been used quercetin 800 mg, bromelain 165 mg, zinc acetate 50 mg and ascorbic acid 1 g once daily as supplements for 3 to 5 days during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of quercetin, bromelain, zinc and ascorbic acid combination supplements on patients with COVID-19. The mean levels of WBC, ANC, ALC, AMC and AST were normal among all included patients before and after taking quercetin, bromelain, zinc and ascorbic acid supplements (P-value &gt; 0.05). Quercetin 800 mg, bromelain 165 mg, zinc acetate 50 mg and ascorbic acid 1 g once daily supplements were safe for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and may prevent poor prognosis. Randomized clinical trials needed in the future to ensure the efficacy of quercetin, bromelain, zinc and vitamin c combination.","Background While there was a lack of pharmacological interventions proven to be effective in early, outpatient settings for COVID-19, in a prospective, open-label observational study (pre-AndroCoV Trial) the use of nitazoxanide, ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine demonstrated similar effects, and apparent improvement of outcomes compared to untreated patients. The unexpected apparent positive results led to ethical questions on the employment of further full placebo-control studies in early stage COVID-19. The objective of the present study was to elucidate whether the conduction of a full placebo-control RCT was still ethically viable, through a comparative analysis with two control-groups.","Objectives To investigate how the relationship between vitamin D and COVID-19 has been presented in traditional media sources (UK newspapers) and assess the level of misinformation associated with this issue by comparing newspaper article content to the evidence-based guidelines.","","The SEN virus (SENV) has been linked to transfusion-associated non-A-E hepatitis; however, information regarding SENV infections in patients with thalassemia, particularly in those with hepatitis virus co-infections, remains limited. This study investigated the frequency of SENV (genotypes D and H) infections in Iraqi patients with thalassemia who were and were not infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). The study involved 150 \u03b2-thalessemia patients (75 with HCV infections and 75 without) and 75 healthy blood donors. Patient levels of vitamins C and E, liver function markers, and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) were determined. Recovered viral nucleic acids were amplified using the conventional polymerase chain reaction (SENV DNA) or the real-time polymerase chain reaction (HCV RNA) techniques. Only 10% of healthy donors had evidence of SENV infection. Among patients with thalassemia, 80% and 77% of patients with and without concurrent HCV infections, respectively, had SENV infections. DNA sequencing analyses were performed on blood samples obtained from 29 patients. Patients with thalassemia, particularly those with SENV infections, had higher levels of several enzymatic liver function markers and total serum bilirubin (P &lt; 0.05) than did healthy blood donors. Among the examined liver function markers, only gamma-glutamyl transferase demonstrated significantly higher levels in HCV-negative patients infected with SENV-H than in those infected with SENV-D (P = 0.01). There were significantly lower vitamin C, vitamin E, and glutathione peroxidase levels in patients than in healthy donors (P &lt; 0.05), but only glutathione peroxidase levels were significantly lower in HCV-negative thalassemia patients infected with SENV than in those without SENV infections (P = 0.04). The SENV-H genotype sequences were similar to the global standard genes in GenBank. These results increase our understanding of the nature of the SENV-H genotype and the differential role of SENV-H infections, compared to SENV-D infections, in patients with thalassemia, in Iraq.","Background COVID-19 is a respiratory disease that results in a prothrombotic state manifesting as thrombotic, microthrombotic and thromboembolic events. As a result, several antithrombotic modalities have been implicated in the treatment of this disease. This study aimed to identify if therapeutic anticoagulation or concurrent use of antiplatelet and anticoagulants was associated with an improved outcome in this patient population.","Introduction Although in vitro and animal studies have shown that iron loading in pancreatic beta-cells impaired insulin secretion, no human studies have documented the acute effects of oral iron on beta-cell insulin secretory capacity. In this study, we determined beta-cell insulin secretory capacity at baseline and after a single oral dose of iron (ferrous sulphate, 120 mg elemental iron) in healthy male individuals.","Background Prevention of coronavirus (COVID-19) regarding households has many aspects, such as buying masks, hand sanitizer, face shield, and many others. As a result of buying the previous items, the household spending per month will be increase during the COVID-19 pandemic period.","Infection with SARS-CoV-2 has highly variable clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic infection through to life-threatening disease. Host whole blood transcriptomics can offer unique insights into the biological processes underpinning infection and disease, as well as severity. We performed whole blood RNA Sequencing of individuals with varying degrees of COVID-19 severity. We used differential expression analysis and pathway enrichment analysis to explore how the blood transcriptome differs between individuals with mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19, performing pairwise comparisons between groups. Increasing COVID-19 severity was characterised by an abundance of inflammatory immune response genes and pathways, including many related to neutrophils and macrophages, in addition to an upregulation of immunoglobulin genes. Our insights into COVID-19 severity reveal the role of immune dysregulation in the progression to severe disease and highlight the need for further research exploring the interplay between SARS-CoV-2 and the inflammatory immune response.","Background and purpose The objective of this systematic review is to summarize the effects of ivermectin for the prevention and treatment of patients with COVID-19 and to assess inconsistencies in results from individual studies with focus on risk of bias due to methodological limitations.","Background Evidence recommends that vitamin D might be a crucial supportive agent for the immune system, mainly in cytokine response regulation against COVID-19. Hence, we carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis in order to maximize the use of everything that exists about the role of vitamin D in the COVID-19.","Objectives This study aimed to analyse the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of critical COVID-19 cases and investigate risk factors including comorbidities and age in relation with the clinical aftermath of COVID-19 in critical cases in Bangladesh.","Background Exposure to individual metals (and metalloids; hereafter \u2018metals\u2019) is associated with adverse cardiometabolic outcomes. Specifying analytic models to assess relationships among metal mixtures and cardiometabolic outcomes requires evidence-based models of the (assumed) causal structures; however, such models have not been previously published.","Little is known about how normal variation in dietary patterns in humans affects the aging process, largely because both nutrition and the physiology of aging are highly complex and multidimensional. Here, we apply the nutritional geometry framework to data from 1560 older adults followed over four years to assess how nutrient intake patterns affect the aging process. Aging was quantified via blood biomarkers integrated to measure loss of homeostasis. Additionally, we extend nutritional geometry to 19 micronutrients. Salient results include benefits of intermediate protein and vitamin E intake. Broadly, we show that there are few simple answers of \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d nutrients \u2013 optimal levels are generally intermediate, but dependent on other nutrients. Simpler linear/univariate analytical approaches are insufficient to capture such associations. We present an interactive tool to explore the results, and our approach presents a roadmap for future studies to explore the full complexity of the nutrition-aging landscape.","Background The epidemiology of the Coronavirus-disease associated mucormycosis (CAM) syndemic is poorly elucidated. We aimed to identify risk factors that may explain the burden of cases and help develop preventive strategies.","Since the declaration of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, patients with migraine were specifically vulnerable to worsening of their headaches. Traditional medicine (TM) has been used to treat headache disorders for centuries, especially during times of a healthcare emergencies, similar to the current pandemic. We aimed to assess the use of TM in treatment of migraine amid COVID-19 pandemic in Kuwait, using an online, self-administered questionnaire. A total of 1018 patients completed the survey. TM was used by 39.9% respondents. The greatest users of TM were those with older age (p =0.04), and longer disease duration (p =0.005). TM users were found to be more compliant to treatments than non-TM users (p&lt;0.02). However, they reported significantly less communication with their physicians (p &lt;0.001) during the pandemic. This study showed higher rates of TM use, as a way of self-treatment, among patients with migraine during COVID-19 pandemic. Neurologists should prepare their patients with \u201crescue\u201d strategies for headache management, and new means of communication, to face these \u201cnew normal\u201d challenges.","In this study, we summarize the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 outbreak among Healthcare workers (HCWs) in a tertiary care hospital and compared various parameters and preventive measures taken by positive HCWs to a comparable cohort of COVID negative HCWs. 52.1% of COVID-19 positive HCWs showed symptoms of which only three needed hospitalization possibly due to a younger cohort of HCWs who got infected (35.9 \u00b1 9.3 years). Findings of present study found some protective role of full course prophylactic hydroxychloroquine as compared to a control group (p=0.021) and use of N95 masks over others (p&lt;0.001). Our results did not show any added protection with the use of prophylactic Vitamin C, D, Zinc, or betadine gargles. We also observed outbreak control with increased awareness, near universal testing, PPE provision, sanitization drive, and promoting social distancing among HCWs.","Introduction Covid-19 vaccines can cause adverse events (AE) that can lead to increased hesitation or fear of vaccination. This study aims at estimating the prevalence of severe adverse events (SAEs) and their associated factors among health professionals (HPs) vaccinated with COVISHIELD\u2122 vaccine in Togo.","Computational Drug Repositioning aims at ranking and selecting existing drugs for use in novel diseases or existing diseases for which these drugs were not originally designed. Using vast amounts of available omic data in digital form within an in silico screening has the potential for speeding up considerably the shortlisting of promising candidates in response to outbreaks of diseases such as COVID-19 for which no satisfactory cure has yet been found. We describe DrugMerge as a methodology for preclinical computational drug repositioning based on merging multiple drug rankings obtained with an ensemble of Disease Active Subnetwork construction algorithms. DrugMerge uses differential transcriptomic data from cell lines/tissues of patients affected by the disease and differential transcriptomic data from drug perturbation assays, in the context of a large gene co-expression network. Experiments with four benchmark diseases (Asthma, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Prostate Cancer, and Colorectal Cancer) demonstrate that our method detects in first position drugs in clinical use for the specified disease, in all four cases. Our method is competitive with the state-of-the-art tools such as CMAP (Connectivity Map). Application of DrugMerge to COVID-19 data found rankings with many drugs currently in clinical trials for COVID-19 in top positions, thus showing that DrugMerge is able to mimic human expert judgment.","Neurocognitive development is a dynamic process over the life course and is influenced by intrauterine factors as well as later life environment. Using data from the Pune Maternal Nutrition Study (PMNS) from 1994 to 2008, we investigate the association of in-utero, birth, and childhood conditions with offspring neurocognitive development in 686 participants of the cohort, at age 12 years. The life course exposure variables in the analysis include maternal pre-pregnancy size and nutrition during pregnancy, offspring birth measurements, nutrition and physical growth at age 12 years along with parental education and socio-economic status. We used the novel Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) approach; which has been shown to have better predictive performance over traditional tests of associations. Our study employs 8 standard neurocognitive tests that measure intelligence, working memory, visuo-conceptual and verbal learning, and decision-making/attention at 12 years of age. We control for nutritional-metabolic information based on blood measurements from the pregnant mothers and the children at 12 years of age. Our findings highlight the critical role of parental education and socioeconomic background in determining child neurocognitive performance. Maternal characteristics (pre-pregnancy BMI, fasting insulin during pregnancy) and child height at 12 years were also robust predictors on the BMA. A range of early factors \u2013 such as maternal folate and ferritin concentrations during pregnancy, and child\u2019s head circumference at birth \u2013 remained important determinants of some dimensions of child\u2019s neurocognitive development, but their associations were not robust once we account for model uncertainty. Our results suggest that intrauterine influences on long term neurocognitive outcomes may be potentially reversible by post birth remediation. In addition to the current nutritional interventions, public health policy should also consider social interventions in children born into families with low socio-economic status to improve human capital.","Objectives To estimate the relationship between moderate alcohol consumption and brain health, determining the threshold intake for harm and identifying whether population subgroups are at differential risk.","Machine learning-based clinical decision support tools for sepsis create opportunities to identify at-risk patients and initiate treatments earlier, critical to improving sepsis outcomes. Increasing use of such systems necessitates quantifying and understanding provider adoption. Using real-time provider interactions with a sepsis early detection tool (Targeted Real-time Early Warning System) deployed at five hospitals over a two-year period (469,419 screened encounters, 9,805 (2.1%) retrospectively-identified sepsis cases), we found high sensitivity (82% of sepsis cases identified), high adoption rates (89% of alerts evaluated by a physician or advanced practice provider and 38% of evaluated alerts confirmed) and an association between use of the tool and earlier treatment of sepsis patients (1.85 (95% CI:1.66-2.00) hour reduction in median time to first antibiotics order). Further, we found that provider-related factors were strongly associated with adoption. Beyond improving system performance, efforts to improve adoption should focus on provider knowledge, experience, and perceptions of the system.","Background Bromhexine hydrochloride has been suggested as a TMPRSS2 protease blocker that precludes the penetration of SARS-CoV-2 into cells. We aimed to assess the preventive potential of regular bromhexine hydrochloride intake for COVID-19 risk reduction in medical staff actively involved in the evaluation and treatment of patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection.","The first COVID-19 case in Mexico was confirmed on 26 February 2020 and by May 3 the number of registered cases had risen to 30,927. However the rate of transmission varied greatly from city to city. We used data on temperature, humidity and ultraviolet radiation (UV) from 45 cities all over the country to explore whether there was an association between these variables and rates of transmission and rates of accumulation of COVID-19 ascribed deaths. The advantage of an in-country study of this kind is that many of the variables that can confound international studies are held constant (e.g. public health policies, methods of reporting, cultural, behavioural and genetic factors). Although the official statistics undoubtedly greatly underestimate the situation in Mexico due to lack of testing, they are underestimated in all cities so this should not introduce bias across the sample. We found that temperature and humidity had no discernible association with transmission rates but that UV during the transmission period was negatively correlated with rates of transmission, suggesting a sterilizing effect. UV in the January preceding the epidemic had a slightly higher association with transmission rates than UV during the transmission period itself. We also found negative associations of UV in the transmission period and in January with rate of cumulative deaths, but at lower levels of statistical significance. We conclude that in addition to a sterilizing effect during the transmission period, UV may have a physiological effect in reducing transmission and deaths due to COVID-19, most likely through the medium of vitamin D production in the body. This follows the growing body of medical evidence that vitamin D deficiency is associated with severity of COVID-19. However, we also found a negative correlation between altitude and rates of COVID-19 transmission, distinct and independent of the UV effect, which may indicate that other physiological processes are also present. In a multiple regression, altitude and UV together accounted for 18% of the variation in transmission rates between cities.","Objective To do a systematic review and critical appraisal of the ongoing clinical trials that are assessing various therapeutic interventions against SARS-CoV-2 with an aim to provide insight into the various interventions tested, clinical rationale, geographical distribution of the trials as well as the endpoints assessed in the studies.","Background Despite effective means to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection, the early treatment seeking behavior of those newly diagnosed with infection is not clear.","At least since March 2020, the multiorgan disease COVID-19 has a firm grip on the world. Although most of the cases are mild, patients from risk populations could develop a cytokine storm, which is characterized by a systemic inflammatory response leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome and organ failure. The present paper will introduce the small molecule MP1032, describe its mode of action, and give rationale why it is a promising option for prevention/treatment of SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine storm. MP1032 is a phase-pure anhydrous polymorph of 5-amino-2,3-dihydro-1,4-pthalazinedione sodium salt that exhibits good stability and bioavailability. The physiological action of MP1032 is based on a multi-target mechanism including localized, self-limiting antioxidant activities that were demonstrated in a model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced joint inflammation. Furthermore, immune-regulatory and PARP-1 modulating properties, coupled with antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 were shown in various cell models. Efficacy has been preclinically elucidated in LPS-induced endotoxemia, a model with excessively activated immune responses that shares many similarities to COVID-19. So far, during oral clinical development with three-months daily administrations, no serious adverse drug reactions occurred highlighting the outstanding safety profile of MP1032.","","Objectives To summarize the effects of intravenous corticosteroid treatment for sepsis defined by the Sepsis-3 criteria in adult patients.","The COVID-19 virus has infected millions of people and resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. By using the logistic regression model, we identified novel critical factors associated with COVID19 cases, death, and case fatality rates in 154 countries and in the 50 U.S. states. Among numerous factors associated with COVID-19 risk, we found that the unitary state system was counter-intuitively positively associated with increased COVID-19 cases and deaths. Blood type B was a protective factor for COVID-19 risk, while blood type A was a risk factor. The prevalence of HIV, influenza and pneumonia, and chronic lower respiratory diseases was associated with reduced COVID-19 risk. Obesity and the condition of unimproved water sources were associated with increased COVID-19 risk. Other factors included temperature, humidity, social distancing, smoking, and vitamin D intake. Our comprehensive identification of the factors affecting COVID-19 transmission and fatality may provide new insights into the COVID-19 pandemic and advise effective strategies for preventing and migrating COVID-19 spread.","Background Among middle-aged and elderly individuals, dietary habits have previously been reported to differ between patients with and without periodontal disease. However, in young adults, there are only a few reports that show a correlation between nutrient/food intake and periodontal disease. Moreover, no report has assessed the correlation between dietary habits measured by a self-administered diet history questionnaire (DHQ) and periodontal disease. Therefore, we assessed the correlation between dietary habits, determined using a DHQ, and periodontal disease in young adult women who are likely to develop a periodontal disease.","INTRODUCTION Due to the spread of SARS CoV-2 virus responsible for COVID-19 disease, there is an urgent need to analyse COVID-2019 epidemic perception in Poland. This study aims to investigate social perception of coronavirus in the Internet media during the epidemic. It is a signal report highlighting the main issues in public perception and medical commutation in real time.","Objective Diabetes is a known risk factor for mortality in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Our objective was to identify prevalence of hyperglycemia in COVID-19 patients with and without prior diabetes and quantify its association with COVID-19 disease course.","Purpose Exploring the effect of COVID-19 diagnosis on the individual has not been explored through an exploratory qualitative approach. This study aims to explore the physical, social, and psychological impact of the diagnosis on the individual through online interviews.","Background Suicide attempts (SA) frequently occur in patients with mood disorders and schizophrenia, which are both accompanied by activated immune-inflammatory and nitro-oxidative (IO&amp;NS) pathways.","Background Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination vary for reasons that remain poorly understood.","Background Anemia occurs because of insufficient hemoglobin, which provides oxygen to the body. Because of its close relationship with various illnesses, it must always be investigated clinically. Previous studies have demonstrated an association between hemoglobin concentration and handgrip strength. Thus, we aimed to analyze the association between handgrip strength and anemia in Korean adults to determine whether the handgrip strength test can be used as a tool to identify anemia.","Background The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 seemed to affect locations in the northern hemisphere most severely appearing to overlap with the pattern of seasonal vitamin D deficiency. Integrating available knowledge, we hypothesised that vitamin D status could play a causal role in COVID-19 outcomes.","","Objective In this study, we evaluated the efficiency of the combination of two variants\u2019 AFO-202 and N-163 strains of Aureobasidium Pullulans produced in comparison with the control arm, which underwent a conventional regimen of treatment alone, for a shorter duration of 15 days.","Background The second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to considerable morbidity and mortality in India, in part due to lack of healthcare access, low health literacy, and poor disease surveillance. In this retrospective, descriptive ecological study, we utilized Google Trends (GT) to characterize the second COVID-19 wave and its association with official case counts based on search terms related to symptoms, testing, disease complications, medications, preventive behaviors, and healthcare utilization.","Background Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has developed into a full-blown global pandemic. It has been reported that patients with COVID-19 meeting the criteria for hospital discharge (including two consecutive negative RT-PCR results) have experienced recurrent PCR positivity. However, the clinical course and risk factors for these patients have not been well described.","","Variables responsible for the differential COVID-19 pandemic severity among countries remain undefined. Zinc, a micronutrient required for immunocompetence, is found deficient in populations. We hypothesized the differential COVID-19 severity observed among European countries could be associated with the Zn-deficiency prevalence. The COVID-19 data from different stages of pandemic, i.e., 8 April, 12 and 26 May 2020, were analyzed for covariation with the estimated Zn-deficiency. A significant, relatively stable, but negative correlation of Zn-deficiency with cases per million for the time period [r(20): -0.4930 to -0.5335, p-value: 0.02720 to 0.0154] and a steady improvement of covariation with deaths per million [r(20): -0.4056; p-value: 0.0760 on 26 May 2020] was observed. Considering, Zinc\u2019s key immunomodulatory role, widespread deficiency along with the self- and prescribed intervention in different target groups, e.g. children, women, elderly, carefully planned dedicated exploratory studies to understand the basis of the observed association are advisable.","Background Ivermectin is one among several potential drugs explored for its therapeutic and preventive role in COVID-19 infection. The study was aimed to explore the association between ivermectin prophylaxis and development of COVID-19 infection among healthcare workers.","Background COVID-19 is a rapidly spreading disease that has caused extensive burden to individuals, families, countries, and the world. Effective treatments of COVID-19 are urgently needed. This is the second edition of a living systematic review of randomized clinical trials assessing the effects of all treatment interventions for participants in all age groups with COVID-19.","Purpose We have recently demonstrated that dietary nitrate, a source of nitric oxide via the enterosalivary pathway, can improve muscle contractile function in healthy older men and women. Nitrate ingestion has also been shown to reduce blood pressure in some, but not all, studies of older individuals. However, the optimal dose for eliciting these beneficial effects is unknown.","The COVID-19 pandemic originated in Wuhan, China on December 31st and spread into international borders, leading to a public health crisis and complete shutdown of countries. The strict quarantine measures taken by governments kept a large number of people, around the world, in isolation and affected many aspects of people\u2019s lives. These unprecedented changes triggered a wide variety of psychological problems ranging from panic disorders, anxiety and depression. In this study, we aim to explore anxiety levels among parents, teachers and the general community amid the COVID-19 pandemic in the UAE, as well as identify emotional and anxiety disorders in children. Using a web-based cross-sectional survey we collected data from 2,200 self-selected assessed volunteers. Demographic information, knowledge and beliefs about COVID-19, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) using the (GAD-7) scale, emotional problems in children using the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ), worry and fear about COVID-19, coping mechanisms and general health information were collected. The overall prevalence of GAD in the general population was 71% with younger people (59.8%) and females (51.7%) reporting the highest levels of anxiety. Parents who were teachers reported the highest percentage of emotional problems in children (26.7%) compared to parents only (14.6%) or teachers only (4.7%). Multivariate logistic regression for GAD-7 score showed that females, participants who felt public fear was justifiable, persons who worried about COVID-19, persons who intended to take the COVID-19 vaccine and smokers were all associated with anxiety. Multivariate logistic regression for SDQ showed parents who had severe anxiety levels were 7 times more likely to report more emotional problems in their children (OR=7.00, 95% CI, 3.45 to 14.0) than less anxious parents. Findings suggest the urgency of policy makers to develop effective screening and coping strategies for parents and teachers and more specifically for vulnerable children.","Background Ischemia-related injury during the pre-implantation period impacts kidney graft outcome. Evaluating these lesions by a non-invasive approach before transplantation could help to understand the mechanisms of graft injury and identify potential biomarkers predictive of graft outcomes. This study aims to determine metabolomic content of graft perfusion fluids and its dependence on preservation time and to explore whether tubular transporters are possibly involved in the metabolomics variations observed.","We combined clinical, cytokine, genomic, methylation and dietary data from 43 young adult monozygotic twin pairs (aged 22 \u2013 36, 53% female), where 25 of the twin pairs were substantially weight discordant (delta BMI &gt; 3kg/ m2). These measurements were originally taken as part of the TwinFat study, a substudy of The Finnish Twin Cohort study. These five large multivariate data sets (comprising 42, 71, 1587, 1605 and 63 variables, respectively) were jointly analysed using an integrative machine learning method called Group Factor Analysis (GFA) to offer new hypotheses into the multi-molecular-level interactions associated with the development of obesity. New potential links between cytokines and weight gain are identified, as well as associations between dietary, inflammatory and epigenetic factors. This encouraging case study aims to enthuse the research community to boldly attempt new machine learning approaches which have the potential to yield novel and unintuitive hypotheses. The source code of the GFA method is publically available as the R package GFA.","Currently, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has a worldwide epidemic, causing more than 80 million infections and more than 1.7 million deaths. The pandemic has led to the closure of enterprises and schools in many countries, resulting in serious disruption of the global economy and social activities. Remdesivir is currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of COVID-19, but the WHO declared that Remdesivir is almost ineffective against COVID-19. The research and development of vaccines has made great progress, but it will take at least several months for safe and effective vaccines to be widely used clinically. Clinical studies revealed that some Traditional Chinese Medicines, such as Lianhua Qingwen Capsule and Huoxiang Zhengqi Water, exhibited excellent therapeutic effect on COVID-19. However, until now, there is still no cure for COVID-19. Therefore, there is an urgent need to find medicines that can effectively fight against the SARS-CoV-2. In this study, JIE BEN No. 10 (JB10), a fermentation broth produced by Yi traditional medicine fermentation technology, was explored for its anti-coronavirus activity. The in vitro data showed that JB10 could significantly suppresses the replication of the SARS-CoV-2 with an EC50 of 769.1 times dilution and a selection index of 42.68. Further studies indicated that JB10 had significant anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. The analysis of active components suggested that JB10 contained a large amount of superoxide dismutase (SOD), flavones, polyphenols, crude polysaccharide, etc. which may explain the anti-coronavirus activity, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Our study provides a new potentially therapeutic strategy for COVID-19.","BACKGROUND No definitive treatment exists for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Honey and Nigella sativa (HNS) have established antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. Hence, we investigated efficacy of HNS against COVID-19. wide","Background Intake, either as dietary components or as supplements, and blood concentrations of vitamin E, C, lycopene and carotenoids have been associated with a lower risk of incident (ischemic) stroke. However, causality cannot not be inferred from these associations. Here, we investigated causality by analyzing the associations between genetically-influenced antioxidant levels in blood and ischemic stroke using Mendelian Randomization (MR).","Background It is to be determined whether people infected with SARS-CoV-2 will develop long-term immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and retain long-lasting protective antibodies after the infection is resolved. This study was to explore to explore the outcomes of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in four groups of individuals in Wuhan, China.","Background To be universally applicable in treatment of severe COVID-19, novel therapies, especially those with little toxicity and low cost, are urgently needed. We report here the use of one such therapeutic combination involving two commonly used nutraceuticals, namely resveratrol and copper in patients with this disease. This study was prompted by pre-clinical reports that sepsis-related cytokine storm and fatality in mice can be prevented by oral administration of small quantities of resveratrol and copper. Since cytokine storm and sepsis are major causes of death in severe COVID-19, we retrospectively analyzed outcomes of patients with this condition who had received resveratrol and copper.","Background Neural tube defects (NTDs) remain among the most common congenital anomalies. Contributing risk factors include genetics and nutrient deficiencies, however, a comprehensive assessment of nutrient-gene interactions in NTDs is lacking. We hypothesised that multiple nutrient-gene interactions would be evident in NTD-associated gene signatures.","Major life changing events such as the COVID-19 pandemic may have major impact on one's health and general well-being. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and predictive factors, including gender specific differences, of Complementary Medicine (CM) use (including CM consultations, self-care management and self-help techniques) during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 in the Netherlands. CM use was studied among a random representative sample (n = 1004) of the adult Dutch population using an online survey conducted from 22-27 May 2020. The survey included a modified version of I-CAM-Q and additional questions on demographic characteristics, reasons for CM use, perceived effectiveness and side effects. 68.0% of the participants reported to have used CM (CM consultations (13.3%), self-management strategies (59.4%), self-help techniques (30.0%)). Most frequently reported reason of CM use was to improve general well-being (61.6%), prevention and/or treatment of COVID-19 was only reported by 10%. Perceived effectiveness of CM was high and number of experienced side effects low. Being a women, worried to get infected with COVID-19, higher education and living in northern/ middle region of the Netherlands were predictive factors to use CM. In the Netherlands, specific groups (e.g. women/ highly educated) use CM, mainly to improve general wellbeing, and seem to benefit of it during the first months of the pandemic. The high perceived effectiveness and low reporting of side effects should encourage medical professionals and policy makers for more openness towards considering CM as being part of an integrative approach to public health in times life changing events occur.","Background The MIND diet has been linked with prevention of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and cognitive decline but has not been fully assessed in the context of Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD).","Shigella spp. are the causative agents of bacillary dysentery or shigellosis, mainly in children living in developing countries. The study of Shigella entire life cycle in vivo and the evaluation of vaccine candidates\u2019 protection efficacy have been hampered by the lack of a suitable animal model of infection (1). None of the ones evaluated so far (mouse, rabbit, guinea pig) allows to recapitulate shigellosis symptoms upon Shigella oral challenge. Historical reports suggest that dysentery and scurvy are both metabolic diseases associated with ascorbate-deficiency. Mammals which are susceptible to Shigella infection (humans, non-human primates and guinea pigs) are the lonely ones which are unable to synthesize ascorbate. We optimized a low-ascorbate diet to induce moderate ascorbate-deficiency but not scurvy in guinea pigs (Ascplasma conc.=1.6 \u03bcM vs 36 \u03bcM with optimal ascorbate supply). We demonstrated that moderate ascorbate-deficiency increases shigellosis severity during extended period of time (up to 48h) with all strains tested (Shigella flexneri 5a and 2a, Shigella sonnei). At late time-points, a massive influx of neutrophils was observed both within the disrupted colonic mucosa and in the luminal compartment, although Shigella remains able to disseminate deep into the organ to reach the sub-mucosal layer and the bloodstream. This new model of shigellosis opens new doors for the study both of Shigella infection strategy and innate and adaptive immune responses to Shigella infection. It may be also of a great interest to study the virulence of other pathogen for which no suitable animal model of infection is available (Vibrio cholerae, Yersinia pestis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis or Campylobacter jejuni, among others).","Context Natural antioxidants are vital to promote health and treat critical diseased conditions in the modern healthcare system.","Background Symptoms after COVID-19 infection affect the quality of life of its survivor especially to the special senses including olfactory function. It is important to prevent the disability at an earlier stage. Vaccination as key prevention has been proven to be effective in reducing symptomatic disease and severity. However, the effects of vaccination on post COVID symptoms have not been evaluated. This study aimed to evaluate the possible protection of full vaccination and the occurrence of post-COVID olfactory dysfunction, specifically anosmia and hyposmia in patients who were diagnosed with COVID19.","Introduction Emerging infectious diseases, especially the coronavirus disease identified in 2019 (COVID-19), can be complicated by a severe exacerbation in the Th17 cell-mediated IL-17 proinflammatory immune storm. This enhanced immune response plays a major role in mortality and morbidity, including neurological symptoms. We hypothesized that countering the cytokine storm with thiamine may have therapeutic efficacy in lowering the Th17 cell proinflammatory response. We used an in vitro study and corroborated those results in disease controls (DC). We developed an effective dose range and model for key pharmacokinetic measures with the potential of targeting the cytokine storm and neurological symptoms of COVID-19.","Background The associations between vegetable intake and metabolic risk factors remain inconsistent. This study was aimed to investigate the association between cooked and raw vegetable intake with serum lipids, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure and glycemic traits.","Introduction Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) makes up the majority of lung cancer cases. Currently surgical resection of the affected lung parenchyma is the gold standard of treatment. However, as patients are becoming medically more complex and presenting with more advanced disease, minimally invasive image guided percutaneous ablations are gaining popularity. Therefore, comparison of surgical, ablative, and second-line external beam therapies will help clinicians, as management of NSCLC changes. We will conduct a meta-analysis, reviewing literature investigating these therapies in adult patients diagnosed with Stage I NSCLC (tumor ranging from 0-5 cm, with no hilar nor mediastinal nodal involvement, confirmed either through cytology or histology regardless of type).","Objectives We examined the influence of the ex vivo combination therapy of metformin (Met, 1,1-dimethylbiguanide hydrochloride) with sodium selenite (Ss, Na2SeO3) on the changes in the production of nitric oxide (NO) and selected cytokines by circulating monocytes (MOs) during T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL).","Background Nepal is currently under lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic with misinformation circulating on social media. This study aimed to analyse the knowledge and awareness of COVID-19 amongst eye care professionals in Nepal.","Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) occurs after exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). For persons who are at high risk of exposure, the standard of care is personal protection from getting infected. Whether Ayurvedic rasayana drug like Chyawanprash can prevent symptomatic infection in frontline health care workers is unknown.","There is an urgent need for anti-viral agents that treat and/or prevent Covid-19 caused by SARS-Coronavirus (CoV-2) infections. The replication of the SARS CoV-2 is dependent on the activity of two cysteine proteases, a papain-like protease, PL-pro, and the 3C-like protease known as main protease Mpro or 3CLpro. The shortest and the safest path to clinical use is the repurposing of drugs with binding affinity to PLpro or 3CLpro that have an established safety profile in humans. Several studies have reported crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 main protease in complex with FDA approved drugs such as those used in treatment of hepatitis C. Here, we report the crystal structure of 3CLpro in complex Vitamin C (L-ascorbate) bound to the protein\u2019s active site at 2.5 \u00c5ngstrom resolution. The crystal structure of the Vitamin C 3CLpro complex may aid future studies on the effect of Vitamin C not only on the coronavirus main protease but on related proteases of other infectious viruses.","","Objectives This study explores the clinical profiles and factors associated with COVID-19 in Cameroon.","Echinacea purpurea was shown to broadly inhibit coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. This review discusses the available clinical evidence from randomized, blinded and controlled human studies. Two RCTs with results on enveloped viruses, respectively coronavirus infections during prevention treatment were detected. Incidence and/or viral loads were measured by RT-PCR and symptom severity was recorded. Jawad et al. (2012) collected nasopharyngeal swabs from adults (N=755) over 4 months of continuous prevention. Overall, 24 and 47 enveloped virus infections occurred, including 21 and 33 coronavirus detections [229E; HKU1; OC43] with Echinaforce\u00ae extract [2\u2019400mg daily] and placebo, respectively (p=0.0114). Ogal et al. (2021) administered the same extract [1\u2019200mg] or control for 4 months to children (4 \u2013 12 years) (N=203). Echinacea reduced the incidence of enveloped virus infections from 47 to 29 (p=0.0038) whereas 11 and 13 coronavirus detections [229E, OC43, NL63] were counted (p&gt;0.05). Respiratory symptoms during coronavirus infections were significantly lower with area-under-curve AUC=75.8 (+/-50.24) versus 27.1 (+/-21.27) score points (p=0.0036). Importantly, viral loads in nasal secretions were significantly reduced by 98.5%, with Ct-values 31.1 [95% CI 26.3; 35.9] versus 25.0 [95% CI 20.5; 29.5] (p = 0.0479). Results from clinical studies confirm the antiviral activity found for Echinacea in vitro, embracing enveloped respiratory pathogens and therefore coronaviruses as well. Substantiating results from a new completed study seems to extrapolate these effects to the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. As hypothesized, the testified broad antiviral activity of Echinacea extract appears to be inclusive for SARS-CoV-2.","","Background The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic has produced a large number of clinical trial reports with unprecedented rapidity, raising concerns about methodological quality and potential for research waste.","The earliest predictors of future autoimmune diseases are a series of autoantibodies that are rarely evaluated and very within and between diseases. In addition, autoantibodies often appear just prior to disease onset. All of these factors make it difficult to apply interventions that might prevent disease. Earlier predictors of disease are needed. Here, a general population cohort was used to assess whether gut bacterial biomarkers could be identified prior to disease. Gut microbiome analysis on 1741 one-year old Swedish children was performed on samples collected in the late 1990s. These children were then followed for 18 years for the incidence of five autoimmune diseases and autism. Specific bacterial strains in the gut microbiome of one-year-old children have been identified as exclusive to the 96 subjects (cases) who acquired type 1 diabetes, celiac disease, hypothyroidism, Crohn\u2019s disease, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, or autism over their next 18 years. None of these strains were found in the 1645 children (controls) who did not acquire any of these diseases. Ten other strains were exclusive to those who remained disease-free. In most cases, the presence or absence of these bacteria were strongly associated with: 1) high-risk class II human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles; 2) dietary factors; or 3) a combination of HLA genetics and diet. These results have three significant implications: 1) certain class II HLA haplotypes may serve as bacterial gatekeepers early in life, altering microbiome composition thereby creating the potential for dysbiosis and inflammation; 2) the gut microbiome dysbiosis and inflammation during infancy, largely derived from host HLA genetics and diet, may be a common precedent to all five autoimmune diseases and autism; and 3) HLA gatekeeping may prevent gut colonization of beneficial bacteria in those genetically at-risk individuals who could most benefit from probiotic therapy.","This is an anecdotal observation of an intervention study involving laying hens from a commercial farm in the city of Chincha, Peru, who suffered an outbreak caused by Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV), confirmed by clinical observations, serological and molecular tests (PCR).","BACKGROUND Three companion randomized pragmatic trials were recently published assessing the effect of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) on pre- exposure prophylaxis (PrEP - \u201cRajasingham,\u201d NCT04328467), post- exposure prophylaxis (PEP - \u201cBoulware,\u201d NCT04308668) and treatment of early COVID-19 (\u201cSkipper,\u201d NCT04308668). Respectively, they found non-statistically significant reductions in development or persistence of COVID of 17%, 27% and 20% and concluded that HCQ did not reduce, prevent or substantially treat COVID-19 illness.","Background and objectives In an effort to improve donor health, we set out to investigate determinants other than blood donation that increase risk of ID in a healthy population and if they should be implemented into current blood donor selection processes.","Objective To evaluate the quality of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published on Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) and to investigate the reasons behind compromising the quality, if found.","Purpose The Oxford WebQ is a web-based 24-hour dietary assessment method which has been used in UK Biobank and other large prospective studies. The food composition table used to calculate nutrient intakes has recently been replaced with the UK Nutrient Databank, which has food composition data closer in time to when participants completed the questionnaire, and new dietary variables were incorporated. Here we describe the updated version of the Oxford WebQ questionnaire nutrient calculation, and compare nutrient intakes with the previous version used.","Objective To evaluate the benefits and risks of any type of zinc intervention to prevent or treat SARS-CoV-2.","Introduction Covid-19 is a triphasic disorder first typified by a viral phase that lasts from the first onset of symptoms until seven days later. This is followed by a second and third phase, initially characterized by the appearance of lung infiltrates, followed in 20% by respiratory failure. The second phase is usually heralded by an elevation of serologic inflammatory markers including CRP, ferritin, IL-6, LDH as well as D-dimers. Approximately 20% proceed to the second phase and are usually then treated with dexamethasone, provided they are oxygen-dependent since these are the only cases that benefit from dexamethasone. If we had objective criteria to predict this 20% that develop severe illness, they could preemptively be treated with steroids. In this exploratory study we investigated the early use of preemptive steroids in the setting of early disease, in high-risk non-oxygen dependent cases.","BACKGROUND As of January 1, 2021, there have been 81,947,503 confirmed cases of COVID-19, resulting in 1,808,041 deaths worldwide. Several vaccines are now available for emergency use, but it will take many months to immunize the world\u2019s population. There is a pressing need for outpatient treatment now. We reviewed the possible options","Background SARS-CoV-2 infection has severely ravaged health systems, economic and social progress globally in 2020. Seroprevalence studies can provide relevant information on the target populations for vaccination. They are relevant not only in the community, but also for critical population subgroups such as nursing homes or health care facilities. They will assist in strategizing the vaccination policy especially since there is limited availability of the vaccine and vaccine hesitancy","Objective The COVID-19 pandemic was accompanied by varying movement restriction measures across populations worldwide. These restrictions altered daily activities at all levels, including food access and intake, as well as psychological feelings during lockdown. The main objective of the present study was to evaluate health, and nutrition behaviors during confinement during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.","CSF-1R haploinsufficiency causes adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP). Previous studies in the Csf1r+/- mouse model of ALSP hypothesized a central role of elevated cerebral Csf2 expression. Here we show that monoallelic deletion of Csf2 rescues most behavioral deficits and histopathological changes in Csf1r+/- mice by preventing microgliosis and eliminating most microglial transcriptomic alterations, including those indicative of oxidative stress and demyelination. We also show elevation of Csf2 transcripts and of several CSF-2 downstream targets in the brains of ALSP patients, demonstrating that the mechanisms identified in the mouse model are functional in man. Our data provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying ALSP. Since both increased CSF2 levels and decreased microglial Csf1r expression have also been reported in Alzheimer\u2019s disease and multiple sclerosis, we suggest that the unbalanced CSF-1R/CSF-2 signaling we describe in the present study may contribute to the pathogenesis of other neurodegenerative conditions.","Artificial selection is a promising approach to manipulate the function of microbial communities. Here, we report the outcome of two artificial selection experiments at the microbial community level. Both experiments used \u201cpropagule\u201d strategies, in which a set of the best-performing communities are used as the inocula to form a new generation of communities. In both cases, the selected communities are compared to a control treatment where communities are randomly selected. The first experiment used a defined set of strains as the starting inoculum, and the function under selection was the amylolytic activity of the consortia. The second experiment used a diverse set of natural communities as the inoculum, and the function under selection was the cross-feeding potential of the resulting communities towards a reference bacterial strain. In both experiments, the selected communities reached a higher mean and a higher maximum function than the control. In the first experiment this is caused by a decline in function of the control, rather than an improvement of the selected line. In the second experiment, the strong response of the mean is caused by the large initial variance in function across communities, and is the immediate consequence of the spread of the top-performing community in the starting group, whose function does not increase. Our results are in agreement with basic expectations of artificial selection theory, pointing out some of the limitations of community-level selection experiments which can inform the design of future studies.","Introduction High-dose vitamin C (hdVC) is regarded as one of the essential adjunctive drugs for sepsis treatment. The present study aimed to deduce if hdVC could lead to erroneous testing results from the point-of-care glucose (POCG) measurement.","COVI-19 is a variant of coronavirus diseases that has destabilised the entire world and whose cure as at mid-2020 has become elusive. Social media is ablaze with discussions around the pandemic. There is the dire need to delineate the on-going conversations on the infection with the intention of creating awareness on people\u2019s reaction, opinion, action and recommendation that are inimical to the wellbeing of the populace. Hence, this study is geared towards performing thematic analysis of the discussions on social media about COVID-19. We programmatically retrieved data from twitter between 1st March, 2020 to 30th June 2020 with covid-19 related keywords. We processed the data and later categorised them into themes that evolved from the tweets namely Herbs and Vegetables as COVID-10 Panacea, Self-Medication Due to Prescription by Non-Medical Practitioners on Social Media, Conspiracy Theories on COVID-19 and Fear and Anxiety Associated with COVID-19. The results show that many are resulting to herbs to protect themselves against the disease; taking drugs without doctor\u2019s prescription; believing in conspiracy theories and having certain degree of fear.","","Objectives A plethora of medicines have been repurposed or used as adjunctive therapies for COVID-19. We characterized the utilization of medicines as prescribed in routine practice amongst patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in South Korea, China, Spain, and the USA.","Background Despite the observed associations between psychiatric disorders and nutrient intake, genetic studies are limited.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is driven by dysregulated immune responses yet the role of immunometabolism in COVID-19 pathogenesis remains unclear. By investigating 47 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 16 uninfected controls, we found an immunometabolic dysregulation specific for patients with progressed disease that was reversible in the recovery phase. Specifically, T cells and monocytes exhibited increased mitochondrial mass, accumulated intracellular ROS and these changes were accompanied by disrupted mitochondrial architecture. Basigin (CD147), but not established markers of T cell activation, was up-regulated on T cells from progressed COVID-19 patients and correlated with ROS accumulation, reflected in the transcriptome. During recovery, basigin and ROS decreased to match the uninfected controls. In vitro analyses confirmed the correlation and showed a down-regulation of ROS by dexamethasone treatment. Our findings provide evidence of a basigin-related and reversible immunometabolic dysregulation in COVID-19.","The lack of treatment options for COVID-19 has raised many concerns among populations worldwide, which has led to many attempts to find alternative options to prevent the transmission of the disease or to alleviate the progression of the infection, including focusing more on preventive measures (to prevent transmission to other individuals) and the use of natural products and herbal extracts to increase immunity and decrease the probability of getting infected. This study explored the knowledge of the population of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) about COVID-19 preventive measures and their belief about the consumption of herbal products for the prevention of COVID-19 infection. A total of 5,258 individuals participated in this study. Participants\u2019 knowledge about the appropriate COVID-19 preventive measures in terms of handwashing procedures, self-quarantine and social distancing was moderate, with a mean score of 5.5 (SD: 1.7) out of 10 (representing around 55.0% of the total score). About 22.1% (n= 1,161) of the participants reported that they have used herbal products or nutritional supplements during the pandemic period, to protect themselves from the disease. Social media and the Internet (39.4%, n= 372) were the main motivators for the participants to try herbal products. Vitamin C was the most commonly used food supplement to increase immunity and reduces the chance of contracting COVID-19. Our study demonstrated that the general population in Saudi Arabia has a moderate level of knowledge about COVID-19 transmission and preventive measures. A considerable proportion of the population reported the use of herbal products or food supplements in order to protect themselves from the disease. Policymakers are suggested to provide further educational campaigns that increase population knowledge about the disease transmission routes and preventive measures. In addition, the use of herbal products should be evidence-based to ensure patient safety.","","Bitter gourd (Momordica charantia) is a vegetable and medicinal plant of the family Cucurbitaceae. Here we report a chromosome-level assembly, with highest contig N50 (close to 10 Mb) and proportion of sequences placed on chromosomes (96%) in Cucurbitaceae. Population resequencing revealed the divergence between wild and cultivars at about 6000 years ago. Different cultivar groups have distinct allelic compositions in loci associated with domestication traits, suggesting phenotypic changes were achieved by allele frequency shifts in independent loci. Noticeably, one candidate locus for fruit size locates within a region missing from a recent Illumina-based assembly. Despite breeding efforts to increase female flower proportion, the gynoecy locus exhibits high variation within and low differentiation between wild and cultivar groups, likely because artificial directional selection could not overwhelm natural balancing selection. Our study provides resources to further investigate the genetic architecture of bitter gourd as well highlights the importance of a well-assembled genome.","In this paper, I used multivariate linear regression analysis to determine if latitude and ozone concentration predict Covid-2019 cases in 34 countries worldwide. Data pertaining to Covid-2019 cases were extracted from Worldometer. Ozone concentration levels were taken from the open-access database of World Ozone and Ultraviolet Radiation Data Centre (WOUDC). Latitude of specific area where measurement took place was also provided in the database. Preliminary Kendall rank correlation test revealed that Covid-2019 incidence was positively and significantly related to ozone concentration; however, incidence was not significantly related to latitude. Using multivariate linear regression, a statistically significant link between ozone concentration and Covid-2019 incidence in 34 countries was established; however, I found no statistical association between latitude and Covid-2019 incidence refuting previous claims. Prompt health actions should be developed for areas with high ozone concentration in the present and possibly, future outbreaks; however, extensive laboratory analysis should be conducted to further confirm the findings of the study. Nevertheless, the results of this study could serve as a basis for further clinical and large-scale studies.","Background Globally, the novel coronavirus, is a public health problem causing respiratory infections. Since the outbreak of severe acute and Middle East respiratory syndromes coronavirus was not reported to cause human infections. Now, it become an epidemic proportion with growing number of cases and deaths.","Severe COVID 19 disease is associated with high morbidity and mortality with limited therapeutic options. The role of glucocorticoids in treatment of COVID 19 has been riddled with controversy. The study site has been using glucocorticoids in patients with severe COVID 19 since the first few patients of COVID 19 that were admitted. In the initial cohort of 7 patients with severe COVID disease, use of methylprednisolone in a dose of 30 mg twice daily was associated with rapid improvement in oxygenation and decline in CRP levels. While six patients made a complete clinical recovery, one patient died. There were no secondary infections.","","Iodine has strong antimicrobial properties and has been used in topical applications as antiseptic. Its systemic use in form of iodine complexes derived from dried seaweed extract is beneficial in treating various disorders. Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) chronic infection is present in 6-10% of the Pakistani population and is a major healthcare burden that could benefit from innovative therapeutic regimens.","Introduction The aim of this paper was to assess Australian primary healthcare providers\u2019 perspectives and knowledge about dementia risk factors and risk reduction.","Background Evidence that nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive interventions can improve maternal and child nutrition status in sub-Saharan Africa is inconclusive. Using behaviour change theory and techniques in intervention design may increase effectiveness and make outcomes more predictable. This systematic review aimed to determine whether interventions that included behaviour change functions were effective.","Ivermectin is a safe, inexpensive and effective early COVID-19 treatment validated in 20+ RCTs. Having developed combination therapies for Helicobacter pylori, we tested various COVID-19 combinations and describe the most effective. In 24 consecutive COVID-19 subjects with high risk features, hypoxia and untreated moderate-severe symptoms averaging 9 days, we trialed this novel combination comprising ivermectin, doxycycline, zinc, and Vitamins D and C. It was highly effective. All subjects resolved symptoms in 11 days on average, and oxygen saturation improved in 24hrs (87.4% to 93.1%, p=0.001). Hospitalizations and deaths were significantly fewer (p&lt;0.002 or 0.05, respectively) than in background-matched controls from the CDC database. Triple combination therapy is safe and effective even in moderate-severe patients with hypoxia treated in the outpatient setting.","Background COVID-19 pandemic has ignited the urge for repurposing old drugs as candidate antiviral medicines to treat novel challenges of viral infections. Niclosamide (NCS) is an anti-parasitic drug of known antiviral potential. Therefore, this study attempts to investigate the antiviral effect and safety of NCS on SARS-CoV-2 caused COVID-19 patients.","","Background COVID-19 patients suffer from hypercoagulation and activated immune-inflammatory pathways. This study was performed to assay serum complement C3 and C4, and thromboxane A2 (TxA2) and prostacyclin (PGI2) in association with chest CT scan anomalies (CCTAs) and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2)","Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD) is one of the largest health crises in the world. There are, however, limited but expensive pharmaceutical interventions to treat AD and most of the treatment options are not for cure or prevention, but to slow down the progression of the disease. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of tactile stimulation on AD-like symptoms and pathology in APP NL-G-F/NL-G-F mice, a mouse model of AD. The results show that tactile stimulation improves the AD-like symptoms on tests of cognition, motor, and anxiety-like behaviours and these improvements are associated with reduced AD pathology in APP mice.","Background Nutrition is a modifiable risk factor for ischemic stroke. As people age their ability to absorb some nutrients decreases, an example is vitamin B12. Older individuals with a vitamin B12 deficiency are at a higher risk for stroke and have worse outcome. However, the mechanisms through which these occur remain unknown.","Background The identification of effective strategies capable of reducing the case mortality rate of high-risk COVID-19 is an urgent and unmet medical need. We recently reported the clinical safety profile of RJX, a well-defined intravenous GMP-grade pharmaceutical formulation of anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory vitamins as active ingredients, in a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03680105) (Uckun et al., Front. Pharmacol. 11, 594321. 10.3389/fphar.2020.594321). Here we report data from a pilot clinical study (RPI-015) which examined the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of using RJX in combination with clinical standard of care (SOC) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with pneumonia (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04708340). In addition to our early clinical proof of concept (POC) data, we also present non-clinical POC from a mouse model of CRS and ARDS that informed the design of the reported clinical study.","Objectives To investigate prevalence of beliefs in COVID-19 misinformation and examine whether demographic, psychosocial and cognitive factors are associated with these beliefs, and how they change over time.","Background: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease that typically progresses through four stages, from mild stiffness to severe disability. The critical involvement of gut microbial dysbiosis in promoting RA has been intriguing. The aim of this study was to investigate stage-specific roles of microbial dysbiosis and metabolic disorders in pathogenesis across successive stages of RA. Methods: In this multi-omics cohort study, fecal metagenomic, plasma metabolomic data were collected from 76 patients grouped into four RA stages, 19 patients with osteoarthritis, and 27 healthy individuals in China. A non-redundant gene catalogue was constructed, functionally annotated, and clustered into metagenomic species (MGS). Leave-one-out analysis was performed to determine the MGS that most drove the microbial dysfunctions with RA across stages. Random forest algorithm was performed to investigate diagnostic potential of microbial or metabolic features for each stage. Additionally, to verify the bacterial invasion of the joint synovial fluid, we conducted 16S rRNA gene sequencing, bacterial isolation, and scanning electron microscopy on joint synovial fluid from another cohort of 271 RA patients grouped into four RA stages. Findings: We found that microbial dysbiosis and metabolic disorders had stage-specific effects on RA progression. For instance, arginine succinyltransferase pathway was elevated mainly in the second and third stages of RA (p=1.4E-03), which was driven by Escherichia coli, and it was correlated with the increase of the rheumatoid factor (p=1.35E-03). Considerable elevation of methoxyacetic acid (p=1.28E-08) and cysteine-S-sulfate (p=4.66E-12) might inhibit osteoblasts in the second stage and enhance osteoclasts in the third stage, respectively. Moreover, fecal microbes Eggerthella lenta and Bifidobacterium longum that were exclusively elevated in the fourth stage, were also detected in the joint synovial fluid. Interpretation: Our findings elucidate for the first time the stage-specific roles of microbial dysbiosis and metabolic disorders across successive stages of RA, which open up new avenues for RA prognosis and therapy. We demonstrate the buildup of these effects might induce microbial invasion of the joint synovial fluid in the fourth stage of RA.","Aggressive immune response, due to over-expressed pro-inflammatory molecules, had been characterized in COVID-19 patients. Some of those mediators have a dual and opposite role on immune-systems to play behind differential disease severities. We investigated the expression of some cytokines and chemokines in COVID-19 patients in Bangladesh. We diagnosed the patients by detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasal swab samples by the real-time RT-PCR method. Thirty adult patients were preselected based on their disease severities and grouped into mild, moderate, and severe cases. Nine healthy volunteers participated in this study as control. Relative expression of nine cytokines/chemokine in total leukocytes was semi-quantified in SYBRgreen-based qRT-PCR. We performed statistical tests on transformed log data using SPSS 24.0. At the onset of symptoms (day-1), ACE2 (P &lt; 0.05) and IL-6 (P &gt; 0.05) were up-regulated in all COVID-19 groups, although expression levels did not significantly correlate with disease severities. However, expression of IL-6, MCP-1, MIP-1\u03b1, TNF-\u03b1, RANTES, and ACE2, on day-14, were positively correlated with disease severities. Relative viral load at day-1 showed no significant correlation with cytokine expression but had a significant positive correlation with RANTES and ACE2 expression on day-14 (P &lt; 0.05). Male patients had a higher level of IL-6 than female patients on day-1 (P &lt; 0.05). All COVID-19 patients showed up-regulated cytokines and chemokines on the day-14 compared to day-1 except TNF-\u03b1. Female patients had higher expression of ACE2 and IL-12 on day-14. Up-regulated cytokines/chemokines at the convalescent stage, especially IL-6, may target anti-cytokine therapy in post-COVID-19 patients\u2019 management.","Sepsis manifests due to the host\u2019s dysregulated immune response to an infection. High dose ascorbic acid (AA) has emerged as a potential treatment of sepsis, yet little is known regarding how ascorbic acid influences the immune system in sepsis, such as monocytes. The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of high dose AA on monocyte polarization and cytokine production in vitro.","Wild relatives of tomato are a valuable source of natural variation in tomato breeding, as many can be hybridized to the cultivated species (Solanum lycopersicum). Several, including Solanum lycopersicoides, have been crossed to S. lycopersicum for the development of ordered introgression lines (ILs). Despite the utility of these wild relatives and their associated ILs, limited finished genomes have been produced to aid genetic and genomic studies. We have generated a chromosome-scale genome assembly for Solanum lycopersicoides LA2951 using PacBio sequencing, Illumina, and Hi-C. We identified 37,938 genes based on Illumina and Isoseq and compared gene function to the available cultivated tomato genome resources, in addition to mapping the boundaries of the S. lycopersicoides introgressions in a set of cv. VF36 x LA2951 introgression lines (IL). The genome sequence and IL map will support the development of S. lycopersicoides as a model for studying fruit nutrient/quality, pathogen resistance, and environmental stress tolerance traits that we have identified in the IL population and are known to exist in S. lycopersicoides.","","Les cultures maraicheres sont en expansion considerable sur les berges du Lac Dangsitue a proximite de l'Universite de Ngaoundere dans la region de l'Adamaoua auCameroun.

Few studies measured the soluble receptor for advanced glycation end product (sRAGE), angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), calcium and magnesium in COVID-19.","There is wide variability in the propensity of somatic cells to reprogram into pluripotency in response to the Yamanaka factors. How to segregate these variability to enrich for cells of specific traits that reprogram efficiently remains challenging. Here we report that the variability in reprogramming propensity is associated with the activity of the MKL1/SRF transcription factor and concurs with small cell size as well as rapid cell cycle. Reprogramming progressive cells can be prospectively identified by their low activity of a widely used synthetic promoter, CAG. CAGlow cells arise and expand during cell cycle acceleration in the early reprogramming culture of both mouse and human fibroblasts. Our work illustrate a molecular scenario underlying the distinct reprogramming propensities and demonstrate a convenient practical approach for their enrichment.","Atrazine is an herbicide and pollutant of great environmental concern that is naturally biodegraded by microbial communities. Paenarthrobacter aurescens TC1 is one of the most studied degraders of this herbicide. Here, we developed a genome scale metabolic model for P. aurescens TC1, iRZ1176, in order to study the atrazine degradation process and mechanism at organism level. Constraint based flux balance analysis and time dependent simulations were used to explore the bacteria\u2019s phenotypic landscape. Simulations led to model based predictions for growth and atrazine degradation efficiency in myriad of media supplemented with different combinations of carbon and nitrogen sources. Simulations aimed at designing media optimized for supporting growth and enhancing degradation, bypassing the need in strain design via genetic modifications. Predictions were tested in vitro and experimental growth and degradation measurements support and validate the reliability of the model. Model simulations have prioritized degradation and growth enhancement effect of various amino acid and co-factors. The model presented here can potentially serve as a predictive tool towards achieving optimal biodegradation efficiencies and for the development of ecologically friendly solutions for pollutant degradation.","","","The Averrhoa carambola is commonly known as star fruit because of its peculiar shape and its fruit is a rich source of minerals and vitamins. It is also used in traditional medicines in countries like India, China, the Philippines, and Brazil for treating various ailments such as fever, diarrhea, vomiting, and skin disease. Here we present the first draft genome of the Oxalidaceae family with an assembled genome size of 470.51 Mb. In total, 24,726 protein-coding genes were identified and 16,490 genes were annotated using various well-known databases. The phylogenomic analysis confirmed the evolutionary position of the Oxalidaceae family. Based on the gene functional annotations, we also discovered the enzymes possibly involved in the important nutritional pathways in star fruit genome. Overall, being the first sequenced genome in the Oxalidaceae family, the data provides an essential resource for the nutritional, medicinal, and cultivational studies for this economically important star-fruit plant.","Background Micronutrients are essential for the body to produce enzymes, hormones and other substances essential for proper growth and development. Iodine, potassium iodide and ascorbic acid are ones of the most important in global public health terms. However, their lack represents a major threat to the human and animal health.","","Mass Spectrometry imaging (MS imaging) provides spatial information for a wide range of compound classes in different sample matrices. We used MS imaging to investigate the distribution of components in fresh and processed food, including meat, dairy and bakery products. The MS imaging workflow was optimized to cater to the specific properties and challenges of the individual samples. We successfully detected highly nonpolar and polar constituents such as beta-carotene and anthocyanins, respectively. For the first time, the distribution of a contaminant and a food additive was visualized in processed food. We detected acrylamide in German gingerbread and investigated the penetration of the preservative natamycin into cheese. For this purpose, a new data analysis tool was developed to study the penetration of analytes from uneven surfaces. Our results show that MS imaging has great potential in food analysis to provide relevant information about components\u2019 distributions, particularly those underlying official regulations.","Background Acrylamide (ACR) is a naturally occurring, widely used compound, it is generated during cocking carbohydrate rich food at high temperature. Ingestion of large amounts of ACR underlies several health concerns and teratogenicity. Ascorbic acid (vit C) is a strong reducing agent greatly used to clean free radicals.","The diverse cultivars of Brassica oleracea and Brassica napus constitute an important global food source. Of those, the Brassica oleracea convar. acephala cultivar group containing var. sabellica and var. palmifolia and Brassica napus var. pabularia, collectively known as kale, are nutritious leafy greens consumed for their abundance of vitamins and micronutrients. Typified by their curly, serrated or wavy leaves, kale varieties have been primarily defined based on their leaf morphology and geographic origin, despite having complex genetic backgrounds. Kale is a very promising crop for vertical farming due to its high nutritional content. However, systematic analysis of kale growth and molecular composition under different light regimes suitable for vertical farming has been lacking. Hence, we selected nine diverse, publicly available and commercially grown kale cultivars for growth under light emitting diode (LED)-replicated sunlight-like conditions. We then analyzed their growth and nutrition using a combination of phenomics, proteomics and metabolomics. As plant growth and development are driven by the diel molecular activities of plants, we harvested kale leaf tissue at both end-of-day (ED) and end-of-night (EN) time-points for all molecular analyses. Our results reveal that diel metabolome and proteome signatures sub-divide the selected kale cultivars into two distinct groups, defined by their amino acid and sugar content, along with significant proteome differences involving carbon and nitrogen metabolism, mRNA splicing, protein translation and light harvesting. Together, our analysis has generated robust quantitative insights into the diel growth and development landscape of kale, significantly advancing our fundamental understanding of this nutritious leafy green for next-generation breeding and biotechnology.","Cassava (Manihot esculenta crantz) is a major food crop in Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, the Pacific, and South America, where it feeds around 800 million people. Its roots are an excellent source of energy, and its leaves are rich in minerals, vitamins, and protein, which could substantially supplement the current starchy diets if properly detoxified since they contain some toxic anti-nutritional factors. The objective of this study was to provide information on the nutritional profile of cassava root and leaves and role of processing in enhancing and stabilizing their valuable nutrients. Two cassava varieties, kello and qulle, obtained from Areca Agricultural Research Center were used in this study. Roots and leaves were processed (fermented, boiled, and fluid bed dried), and nutritional, anti-nutritional, and functional properties were assessed using AOAC (Association of Official Analytical Chemists) standard procedures. As compared to leaves, roots had higher carbohydrate contents, ranging from 81.0 to 87.1 g/100g, whereas leaves had higher protein (21.2 to 28.4g/100g), total carotenoid (234.1 to 987.9 \u03bcg/g), fiber (16.1 to 22.9 g/100g), Ca (499.8 to 545.4 mg/100g), K (1193.4 to 1211.0 mg/100g), Mg (274.5 to 340.5 mg/100g) and Fe (129.1 to 146.1 mg/kg) contents. Anti-nutritional factors were slightly higher in the leaves than in the roots, with toxic cyanides ranging from 10.1 to 61.0 mg/kg in the leaves and from 1.8 to 47.5 mg/kg in the roots. However, the processing of leaves decreased cyanide content from 61.0 mg/kg to 10.1 mg/kg. Similarly, other anti-nutritional factors, such as condensed tannins, oxalates, and phytate were reduced from 52.0 to 21.0 mg/100g, 156.5 to 25.9 mg/100g, and 35.9 to 4.0 mg/100g), respectively. Hence, the fermentation of leaves and roots followed by boiling and drying is an interesting approach to reduce anti-nutritional factors significantly and ensure their nutritional quality. This study revealed that variety kello had a relatively better nutritional profile than variety qulle, for both root and leaves, except for total carotenoid content, which was higher in the latter. Genetic background and processing methods can greatly affect the nutritional profile of cassava varieties, so it is critical to analyze diverse cassava germplasm and refine the processing method to identify highly nutritious and healthy varieties.","","","","This study is aim to determine the chemical composition and antioxidant activity of the essential oil from lotus leaves. The different methods and solvents were selected to extract oils from lotus leaves. About 38 components were found by GC-MS analysis, representing as 12, 15-octadecatrienoic acid (34.99%), linoleic acid and hexadecanoic acid. TBARS value, AV value and IV value reflected the various physicochemical indexes and lipid properties of Folium nelumbinis oil. Furthermore, antioxidant activities of the leaf samples were examined by FRAP and DPPH assays. In all systems, twice methanol-decolorized and ultrasonic-assisted essential oil using hexane solvent exhibited a higher potential activitythan than that of other extracts (ethanol, ethyl acetate and petroleum ether). These results provide a clear picture of the essential oils of Folium nelumbinis and demonstrate that the lotus leaves oil has an huge potential as a kind of chemical additive for the food industry owing to the strong antioxidant capacity.","Biosynthesis of l-ascorbate (AsA) in plants is carried out by a complex metabolic network, which involves d-mannose/l-galactose, d-galacturonate, l-gulose, and myo-inositol as main precursors. Arabidopsis lines over-expressing enzymes in the myo-inositol pathway have elevated AsA, accumulate more biomass of both aerial and root tissues, and are tolerant to abiotic stresses as shown by manual and digital phenotyping. We crossed myo-inositol oxygenase (MIOX4) over-expressers with two low-vitamin C mutants (vtc1-1 and vtc2-1) encoding enzymes involved in d-mannose/l-galactose route. The purpose of developing these crosses was to test MIOX4\u2019s ability to restore the low AsA phenotype in mutants, and to assess the contribution of individual biosynthetic pathways to abiotic stress tolerance. We used a powerful high-throughput phenotyping platform for detailed phenotypic characterization of the Arabidopsis crosses with visible, fluorescence, near-infrared and infrared sensors. We combined digital phenotyping with photosynthetic parameters and soil water potential measurements. Our results show that MIOX4 is able to restore the AsA content of the mutants and the restored lines (vtc+MIOX4) show high AsA, enhanced growth rate, accumulate more biomass, and display healthier chlorophyll fluorescence and water content profiles compared to controls.","Tomatoes are known for their human health benefits. Tomato producers use chemical fertilizers to increase tomato production levels. However, the use of organic fertilizers such as digestate can achieve satisfactory yields while sustaining the soil environment. In this tomato study, the effect of three dilutions of digestate (25%, 50% and 75%) on plant height, leaf area and fruit number were compared to NPK 15 15 15. The 50% dilution of digestate had the most beneficial effect on the plants at the end of the experiment.","","","In plants, it is well-known that ascorbic acid (vitamin C) can be synthesized via multiple metabolic pathways but there is still much to be learnt concerning their integration and control mechanisms. Furthermore, the structural biology of the component enzymes has been poorly exploited. Here we describe the first crystal structure for an L-galactose dehydrogenase (SoGDH from spinach), from the D-mannose/L-galactose (Smirnoff Wheeler) pathway which converts L-galactose into L-galactono-1,4-lactone. The kinetic parameters for the enzyme are similar to those from its homologue from camu-camu, a super-accumulator of vitamin C found in the Peruvian amazon. Both enzymes are monomers in solution, have a pH optimum of 7 and their activity is largely unaffected by high concentrations of ascorbic acid, suggesting the absence of a feedback mechanism acting via GDH. Previous reports may have been influenced by changes of the pH of the reaction medium as a function of ascorbic acid concentration. The structure of SoGDH is dominated by a (\u03b2/\u03b1)8 barrel closely related to aldehyde-keto reductases (AKRs). The structure bound to NAD+ shows that the lack of Arg279 justifies its preference for NAD+ over NADP+, as employed by many AKRs. This favours the oxidation reaction which ultimately leads to ascorbic acid accumulation. When compared with other AKRs, residue substitutions at the C-terminal end of the barrel (Tyr185, Tyr61, Ser59 and Asp128) can be identified to be likely determinants of substrate specificity. The present work contributes towards a more comprehensive understanding of structure-function relationships in the enzymes involved in vitamin C synthesis.","Gluconobacter oxydans plays important role in conversion of D-sorbitol to L-sorbose, which is an essential intermediate for industrial-scale production of vitamin C. In the fermentation process, some D-sorbitol could be converted to D-fructose and other byproducts by uncertain dehydrogenases. Genome sequencing has revealed the presence of diverse genes encoding dehydrogenases in G. oxydans. However, the characteristics of most of these dehydrogenases remain unclear. Therefore, analyses of these unknown dehydrogenases could be useful for identifying those related to the production of D-fructose and other byproducts. Accordingly, dehydrogenases in G. oxydans WSH-003, an industrial strain used for vitamin C production, were examined. An NAD-dependent dehydrogenase, which was annotated as xylitol dehydrogenase 2, was identified, codon-optimized, and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells. The enzyme exhibited high preference for NAD+ as the cofactor, while no activity with NADP+, FAD, or PQQ was noted. Although this enzyme presented high similarity with NAD-dependent xylitol dehydrogenase, it showed high activity to catalyze D-sorbitol to D-fructose. Unlike the optimum temperature and pH for most of the known NAD-dependent xylitol dehydrogenases (30\u00b0C\u201340\u00b0C and about 6\u20138, respectively), those for the identified enzyme were 57\u00b0C and 12, respectively. The Km and Vmax of the identified dehydrogenase towards L-sorbitol were 4.92 \u03bcM and 196.08 \u03bcM/min, respectively. Thus, xylitol dehydrogenase 2 can be useful for cofactor NADH regeneration under alkaline conditions or its knockout can improve the conversion ratio of D-sorbitol to L-sorbose.","It is widely accepted that cAMP regulates gene transcription principally by activating the protein kinase A (PKA)-targeted transcription factors. Here, we show that cAMP enhances the generation of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in multiple cell types. 5hmC is converted from 5-methylcytosine (5mC) by Tet methylcytosine dioxygenases, for which Fe(II) is an essential cofactor. The promotion of 5hmC was mediated by a prompt increase of the intracellular labile Fe(II) pool (LIP). cAMP enhanced the acidification of endosomes for Fe(II) release to the LIP likely through RapGEF2. The effect of cAMP on Fe(II) and 5hmC was confirmed by adenylate cyclase activators, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, and most notably by stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). The transcriptomic changes caused by cAMP occurred in concert with 5hmC elevation in differentially transcribed genes. Collectively, these data show a previously unrecognized regulation of gene transcription by GPCR-cAMP signaling through augmentation of the intracellular labile Fe(II) pool and DNA demethylation.","A major conceptual gap in taste biology is the lack of a general framework for understanding the evolution of different taste modalities among animal species. We turn to two complementary nutritional frameworks, biological stoichiometry theory and nutritional geometry, to develop hypotheses for the evolution of different taste modalities in animals. We describe how the attractive tastes of Na, Ca, P, N and C containing compounds are consistent with principles of both frameworks based on their shared focus on nutritional imbalances and consumer homeostasis. Specifically, we suggest that the evolution of multiple nutritive taste modalities can be predicted by identifying individual elements that are typically more concentrated in the tissues of animals than plants. Additionally, we discuss how consumer homeostasis can inform our understanding of why some taste compounds (i.e., Na, Ca and P salts) can be either attractive or aversive depending on concentration. We also discuss how these complementary frameworks can help to explain the phylogenetic distribution of different taste modalities and improve our understanding of the mechanisms that lead to loss of taste capabilities in some animal lineages. The ideas presented here will stimulate research that bridges the fields of evolutionary biology, sensory biology and ecology.","The enzymatic steps involved in l-ascorbate biosynthesis in photosynthetic organisms (the Smirnoff-Wheeler, SW pathway) has been well established and here we comprehensively analyze the subcellular localization, potential physical interactions of SW pathway enzymes and assess their role in control of ascorbate synthesis. Transient expression of GFP-fusions in Nicotiana benthamiana and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutants complemented with genomic constructs showed that while GME is cytosolic, VTC1, VTC2, VTC4, and l-GalDH have cytosolic and nuclear localization. While transgenic lines GME-GFP, VTC4-GFP and l-GalDH-GFP driven by their endogenous promoters accumulated the fusion proteins, the functional VTC2-GFP protein is detected at low level using immunoblot in a complemented vtc2 null mutant. This low amount of VTC2 protein and the extensive analyses using multiple combinations of SW enzymes in N. benthamiana supported the role of VTC2 as the main control point of the pathway on ascorbate biosynthesis. Interaction analysis of SW enzymes using yeast two hybrid did not detect the formation of heterodimers, although VTC1, GME and VTC4 formed homodimers. Further coimmunoprecipitation (CoIP) analysis indicted that consecutive SW enzymes, as well as the first and last enzymes (VTC1 and l-GalDH), associate thereby adding a new layer of complexity to ascorbate biosynthesis. Finally, metabolic control analysis incorporating known kinetic characteristics, showed that previously reported feedback repression at the VTC2 step confers a high flux control coefficient and rationalizes why manipulation of other enzymes has little effect on ascorbate concentration.","Intact glucosinolate (GSL) profile (five aliphatic; three aromatic, and one indolic glucosinolate) in the leaves of 50 germplasm collections and commercial cultivars of Brassica rapa, Brassica juncea, and Brassica oleracea collected from six different countries and grown under uniform cultural conditions were compared by UPLC-MS/MS. Total GSLs content ranged from 36.80 to 2383.12 \u03bcmol/kg DW. Aliphatic GSLs predominated among the entire samples representing from 23.0 to 98.9% of the total GSLs content, where gluconapin and glucobrassicanapin contributed the greatest proportion. Other GSLs such as, progoitrin (PRO), glucotropaeolin (TRO), and glucobarbarin (BAR) were found in relatively low concentrations. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) yielded three principal components with eigenvalue \u2265 1, representing 70.33% of the total variation across the entire data set. Accessions IT260822 &amp; IT32750, and commercial cultivar, \u201cHangamssam2\u201d, were well distinguished from other samples in the PCA plot due to their significantly high amount of BAR, glucobrassicin (GBC), and glucoerucin (ERU), respectively. The inter- and intra-leaf variations of GSLs were examined in three kimichi cabbage varieties. The GSLs content varied significantly among leaves in different positions (outer, middle, and inner) and sections within the leaves (top, middle, bottom, green/red, and white). Higher GSL contents were observed in the proximal half &amp; white section of the leaves and inner positions (younger leaves) in most of the samples. GBC, gluconasturtiin (NAS), and glucoberteroin (BER) should be studied profusely in Brassica plants as some of their degradation products of GBC and NAS are useful in cancer chemopreventive functions, whereas BER takes part in the process of suppressing aging of the skin. GSLs are regarded as allelochemicals; hence, the data related to the patterns of GSLs within the leaf and between leaves at different position could be useful to understand the defense mechanism of Brassica plants. The observed variability could be useful for breeders to develop Brassica crops with high GSL content or specific profiles of GSLs as required.","Hedysarum neglectum is a forage plant. Xanthone glycoside - mangiferin is extracted from this plant and used for medicine \u201cAlpizarin\u201d. In addition to substances of xanthone nature (mangiferin and isomangiferin) Hedysarum neglectum contains sugars, vitamins and provitamins, tannins; in the underground part it contains oligomeric catechins, isoflavonoids, butylphenols, alkaloids, tannins, flavonoids, saponins, coumarins, carbohydrates, vitamin C. For selecting optimal schemes of fractionization of substances, it is necessary to resort to multi-stage schemes of group-wide (preliminary) isolation and preparative accumulation. In particular cases, it is necessary to take into account the presence of concomitant substances, as well as the effectiveness and selectivity of the sorption-chromatographic technologies used. According to the results of the studies, the use of silica gel and sefadex LH-20 for the isolation of a complex of flavonoids and gallic acid is the most effective method for the selection of the optimal variant of the preparative isolation of the total amount of BAS in mcg/ml. The results of the research allowed us to identify the target biologically active substances with a degree of extraction of at least 80%: - fractions of xanthones, flavonoids, gallic acid.","","L-ascorbic acid, commonly known as vitamin C, is a ubiquitous 6-carbon carbohydrate characterized by its ability to scavenge free radicals. In enteric bacteria, L-ascorbate can be utilized as a nutrient using the UlaABCDEF and UlaG-UlaRpathway under anaerobic conditions. In this study, we identified homologs of the Ula system within Vibrio cholerae and showed that V. cholerae is able to utilize L-ascorbate as an energy source. Growth pattern assays of a ulaG in-frame deletion mutant demonstrated that ulaG is essential for L-ascorbate fermentation. Expression analysis showed that ula catabolism and transport genes were significantly induced in cells grown in the presence of L-ascorbate compared to glucose and these genes were also highly induced during growth on intestinal mucus. In in vitro growth competition assays, the ulaG mutant was outcompeted by wild type when grown in intestinal mucus suggesting the Ula system could be important for fitness. Within the ula operon in V. cholerae and all Vibrio species a homology of ORF VCA0243 is present that encodes a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) phosphatase. This enzyme in E. coli, converts the active form of vitamin B6 PLP to its inactive form pyridoxal (PL). In V. splendidus and related species, the aerobic and anaerobic L-ascorbate pathway genes cluster together and both systems contain a PLP phosphatase. An in-frame deletion mutant of vca0243 resulted in a growth defect in L-ascorbate fermentation as well as additional carbon and amino acid sources indicating a role in cellular metabolism. Phylogenetic analysis of UlaG and UlaD suggested the region was acquired by horizontal gene transfer.","","Impaired hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism are hallmarks of type\u20132 diabetes. Increased sulfide production from cysteine, or sulfide\u2013donor compounds, may beneficially regulate hepatic metabolism. Disposal of sulfide through the sulfide oxidation pathway (SOP) is critical for maintaining sulfide within a safe physiological range. We show that mice lacking the liver\u2013enriched mitochondrial SOP enzyme thiosulfate sulfur\u2013transferase (Tst\u2212/\u2212 mice) exhibit high circulating sulfide, increased gluconeogenesis, hypertriglyceridemia and fatty liver, despite whole\u2013body insulin\u2013sensitisation. Unexpectedly, hepatic sulfide levels were normal in Tst\u2212/\u2212 mice, a result of homeostatic induction of mitochondrial sulfide disposal and glutathione excretion associated with net suppression of protein persulfidation and nuclear respiratory factor\u20132 target proteins. Proteomic and persulfidomic profiling converged on gluconeogenesis and hepatic lipid metabolism and revealed a selective deficit in medium\u2013chain fatty acid oxidation in Tst\u2212/\u2212 mice. We reveal a critical role for TST in hepatic metabolism that raises implications for sulfide-donor strategies in the context of liver function and metabolic disease.","","Wheatgrass has emerged as a functional food source in recent years, but the detailed metabolomics basis for its health benefits remains poorly understood. In this study, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis were used to study the metabolic profiling of seedlings from wheat, barley, rye and triticale, which revealed 1800 features in positive mode and 4303 features in negative mode. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed clear differences between species, and 164 differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) were detected, including amino acids, organic acids, lipids, fatty acids, nucleic acids, flavonoids, amines, polyamines, vitamins, sugar derivatives and others. Unique metabolites in each species were identified. This study provides a glimpse into the metabolomics profiles of wheat and its wild relatives, which may form an important basis for nutrition, health and other parameters.","In a social context of increasingly concern about healthy diets, the development of new varieties with enhanced content in nutraceutical compounds is an increasingly important objective of the fruit breeding programs currently developed. In this sense, apricot is a fruit crop very appreciated by consumers due to its organoleptic characteristics, but also plays an important role in human nutrition due to its contain of phytocompounds as sugars, organic acids, vitamins and polyphenols. In this work, new selections from the apricot breeding program carried out at the Instituto Valenciano de Investigaciones Agrarias (IVIA) and traditional varieties have been analysed aimed at identifying sources of genetic variation for fruit quality. For this purpose, sugar content, organic acids and ascorbic acid were studied during two crop years. Results revealed sucrose and glucose as the major sugars, malic and citric acid as the main organic acids, and diverse ascorbic acid content among the cultivars studied. Results obtained pointed some accessions as potential sources to increase fruit quality. In addition, the study showed that apricot peel is an excellent source of nutraceutical compounds. Moreover, this study opens up new possibilities for future work to study the genetic control of these traits in apricot.","Objective Cyanide is a highly toxic compound, and the consumption of products containing cyanide is of singificant public health concern. In contrast, \u03b2-carotene possesses essential nutritional attributes related to human health, therefore the characterisation and quanfication of both compounds in food products is both fundamental and necessary. This investigation sought to identify the cyanide and \u03b2-carotene levels in two flours produced from the roots of two varieties of cassava (Manihot esculenta crantz), namely UMUCASS-38 (TMS 01/1371) and NR 8082, and their associated food products.","Change in climate of the entire globe due to elevated temperature and minimum annual rainfall in barren zone frequently leads to salinity of soil. The current study was aimed to evaluate the importance of sugar beet extract (SBE) as a bio-stimulant to improve the adverse damages of induced salinity stress (40mM) on growth, oosmolytes and antioxidant defense system of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). Pot experiment was carried in green house under different concentrations of SBE (10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%) pre-soaked seeds of Hordeum vulgare for 5 hours SBE was analyzed for glycine betaine (100mmol/kg), betalains (1.3mg/l), phenolics (1.30g/100ml), flavonoids (0.59mg/ml), carotenoids (0.23ml/100ml), vitamin E (0.002%), vitamin C (8.04g/100ml), sugar (8g/100ml), protein (1.39mg/100ml), and oxalic acid (38mg/100ml) while Ca (13.72mg/l), Mg (7.121 mg/l) and K (11.45mg/l) contents were also determined. We found significant improvement in germination parameters of Hordeum vulgare L. via SB extract on coefficient of velocity of emergence (CVE), mean emergence time (MET), germination energy (GE), timson germination index (TGI), germination rate index (GRI) and time to 50% emergence (E50) under induced salinity stress. However, photosynthetic pigments, e.g., chlorophyll and carotenoids were enhanced using 40% SB extract, soluble sugar, protein, proline, POD, MDA with 50% SB extract while SOD and H2O2 in 20% SBE, respectively. Our findings suggested that SB extract promotes both agronomical and physiological attributes, is a positive way to enhance our economy by increasing crop yields in arid and semi-arid areas along with plant tolerance to under induced salinity stress.","The aim of this study is to explore the optimal N, P and K fertilization model suitable for pear-jujube in the mountain of northern Shaanxi in 2016 years. This experiment use 3-factor, saturated optimal design for quadratic fertilization scheme. The effects of different fertilization treatments on the yield and quality of pear-jujube were studied through field experiments. And comprehensive evaluation based on the quality of pear-jujube. The results showed that N1P3K3 has the highest yield, which is 48% higher than the control (CK). The effect of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium on yield is potassium fertilizer (positive effect)&gt; phosphate fertilizer (positive effect)&gt; nitrogen fertilizer (negative effect). Phosphate and potassium fertilizers have significant effects on increasing the content of soluble solids. Application of potassium fertilizer alone can significantly increase the content of reduced Vitamins c. The combined application of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium reduced the content of reduced Vitamins c. N3P3K1 treatment can significantly increase the total sugar content in fruits. Single application of phosphate and potassium increases the content of organic acids in fruits. Other fertilization treatments have significant effects on reducing the content of organic acids in fruits. The sugar-acid ratio of N3P3K1 is significantly higher than CK, which had an important effect on improving the taste. A high amount of potassium fertilizer has a significant effect on increasing the total flavonoid content in fruits. The interaction of nitrogen and phosphorus will reduce the total flavonoid content. The effect of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium on quality is potassium (positive effect)&gt; nitrogen (positive effect)&gt; phosphate (positive effect). Comprehensive analysis, the optimal fertilization amount when the target yield is 23000 \u223c 27000 kg\u00b7hm-2 and the quality score is above 85 is nitrogen (N) 406.93 \u223c 499.31 kg\u00b7hm-2, phosphorus (P2O5) 203.94 \u223c 297.08 kg\u00b7hm-2, and potassium (K2O) 285.47 \u223c 322.82 kg\u00b7hm-2.","Background Mine tailings contain rare earth elements, including lanthanum and cerium, and plant micronutrients including iron. Previous studies have demonstrated that fertilizers containing rare earth elements and/or micronutrients can influence plant physiology, nutrient uptake and crop yield. However, applying the right dose of these fertilizers is critical since the concentration range associated with benefits is often narrow, and overapplication can lead to crop yield reductions. This study aimed to quantify the effects of a water-soluble fertilizer, REAP, on the yield of greenhouse crops.","Emerging evidence suggests that a complex interplay between human papillomavirus (HPV), microbiota, and the cervicovaginal microenvironment contribute to HPV persistence and carcinogenesis. Integration of multiple omics datasets is predicted to provide unique insight into HPV infection and cervical cancer progression. Cervicovaginal specimens were collected from a cohort (n=100) of Arizonan women with cervical cancer, cervical dysplasia, as well as HPV-positive and HPV-negative controls. Microbiome, immunoproteome and metabolome analyses were performed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, multiplex cytometric bead arrays, and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, respectively. Multi-omics integration methods, including neural networks (mmvec) and Random Forest supervised learning, were utilized to explore potential interactions and develop predictive models. Our integrated bioinformatic analyses revealed that cancer biomarker concentrations were reliably predicted by Random Forest regressors trained on microbiome and metabolome features, suggesting close correspondence between the vaginal microbiome, metabolome, and genital inflammation involved in cervical carcinogenesis. Furthermore, we show that features of the microbiome and host microenvironment, including metabolites, microbial taxa, and immune biomarkers are predictive of genital inflammation status, but only weakly to moderately predictive of cervical cancer state. Different feature classes were important for prediction of different phenotypes. Lipids (e.g. sphingolipids and long-chain unsaturated fatty acids) were strong predictors of genital inflammation, whereas predictions of vaginal microbiota and vaginal pH relied mostly on alterations in amino acid metabolism. Finally, we identified key immune biomarkers associated with the vaginal microbiota composition and vaginal pH (MIF and TNF\u03b1), as well as genital inflammation (IL-6, IL-10, leptin and VEGF). Integration of multiple different microbiome \u201comics\u201d data types resulted in modest increases in classifier performance over classifiers trained on the best performing individual omics data type. However, since the most predictive features cannot be known a priori, a multi-omics approach can still yield insights that might not be possible with a single data type. Additionally, integrating multiple omics datasets provided insight into different features of the cervicovaginal microenvironment and host response. Multi-omics is therefore likely to remain essential for realizing the advances promised by microbiome research.","Background Low and deficient levels of vitamin A are common in low and middle income countries where tuberculosis burden is high. We assessed the impact of baseline levels of vitamins A and carotenoids on TB disease risk.","In this study, Lentinus edodes (or mushroom) powder and carrot juice were used as raw materials to prepare a new type of nutritious cakes. Microencapsulation was applied in embedding vitamin C to prevent the loss of this vitamin during baking at high temperatures. The most suitable addition amount of each materials was optimized via single-factor test and response surface analysis. The optimal microencapsulation of shiitake mushroom powder with carrot juice required 10 g of mushroom powder, 35 g of soft sugar, 50 mL of carrot juice and 160 g of egg white. The cake prepared herein was rich in nutrient and exuded a unique flavor. This cake was prepared via modern processing technologies and efficient detection techniques. Microencapsulation not only improves the nutritional value of traditional flour products but also expands the scope of research on food processing technologies.","This study aims to systematically review and meta-analyze the nitro-oxidative stress (O&amp;NS)/antioxidant (ANTIOX) ratio in the peripheral blood of people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We searched PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science for articles published from inception until July 31, 2021. Forty-six studies on 3.798 MCI individuals and 6.063 healthy controls were included. The O&amp;NS/ANTIOX ratio was significantly higher in MCI than in controls with a Standardized Mean Difference (SMD)=0.378 (95% CI: 0.250; 0.506). MCI individuals showed increased lipid peroxidation (SMD=0.774, 95%CI: 4.416; 1.132) and O&amp;NS-associated toxicity (SMD=0.621, CI: 0.377; 0.865) and reduced glutathione (GSH) defenses (SMD=0.725, 95%CI: 0.269; 1.182) as compared with controls. MCI was also accompanied by significantly increased homocysteine (SMD=0.320, CI: 0.059; 0.581), but not protein oxidation, and lowered non-vitamin (SMD=0.347, CI: 0.168; 0.527) and vitamin (SMD=0.564, CI: 0.129; 0.999) antioxidant defenses. The results show that MCI is at least in part due to increased neuro-oxidative toxicity and suggest that treatments targeting lipid peroxidation and the GSH system may be used to treat or prevent MCI.","The highest intensity of photosynthesis is obtained under red light, but plants die or their growth gets disrupted if only red light is used. For example, Korean researchers [1] have shown that under pure red light the amount of the grown lettuce is greater than under a combination of red and blue light, but the leaves have a significantly smaller amount of chlorophyll, polyphenols and antioxidants. And the researchers at the Faculty of Biology of the Moscow State University [2] have found that the synthesis of sugars is reduced, growth is inhibited and no blossoming occurs in the leaves of Chinese cabbage under narrow-band red and blue light (as compared to a sodium lamp).","The earth has become increasingly overcrowded as a result of rapid urbanization and population growth, predicting that its carrying capacity could be overstretched. As a result, it is important to test the possibilities of growing plants under space exploration conditions, especially gravitational balance. Since microgravity impedes plant development, to what extent can plant growth stimulators reverse or enhance this trend? A total of 12 maize seeds were weighed and placed sideways in petri dish and inoculated with plant growth stimulators such as indole acetic acid (IAA), gibberellic acid (GA), and ascorbate (AA) and the clinorotated at different rates (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 rpm), while control seeds were just placed on a table. Results showed that at 72 hrs, the maize seeds under microgravity showed reduced germination percentage with increasing clinorotation rates as against the control. But when stimulated with IAA, GA and AA, improved germination percentage was observed as against the control even under microgravity condition. The seedling dry weight, germination time and other germination parameters also showed similar improvements. Comparatively, the three growth stimulators showed no major variations in their ability to improve germination percentage under microgravitational impact. However, IAA showed more improvement on seedling vigor as against others, while GA showed more effect on the peak time and rate of germination. This research confirmed the possibilities of improving germinability of maize seeds under space exploration condition.","Background In Kuwait, prior to the first case of COVID-19 being reported in the country, mass screening of incoming travelers from countries with known outbreaks was performed and resulted in the first identified cases in the country. All COVID-19 cases at the time and subsequently after, were transferred to a single center, Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Hospital, where the patients received standardized investigations and treatments. The objective of this study was to characterize the demographics, clinical manifestations and outcomes in this unique patient population.","Extensive studies were carried out during 2017-2019 to evaluate the Hippophae salicifolia (Seabuckthorn) biodiversity in Uttarakhand for their physico-chemical/biochemical parameters of ripe fruits like acidity (1.78-3.01 %), pH (2.15-2.87), Vitamin \u2018C\u2019 (271-494mg/100g), Total soluble solids (5.1-9.8) etc. Variation was also observed in fruit color (light yellow, yellow, light yellow orange, orange and orange red), fruit size (length 6.29-8.77mm, width 4.80-7.59mm), Juice (44.23-76.18%), Pomace (8.01-28.30%) and seed (6.8-21.1%). On the basis of above parameters, promising morphotypes were identified and conserved at field gene bank at DIBER field station, Auli (Joshimath) 3142m AMSL.","","Plant-beneficial microorganisms are gaining importance for sustainable plant production and phytosanitary practices. Yet there is a lack of computational approaches targeting bacterial traits associated with plant growth-promotion (PGP), which hinders the in-silico identification, comparison, and selection of phytostimulatory bacterial strains. To address this problem, we have developed the new web resource PLaBAse (v1.01, http://plabase.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/pb/plabase.php), which provides a number of services, including (i) a database for screening 5,565 plant-associated bacteria (PLaBA-db), (ii) a tool for predicting plant growth-promoting traits (PGPTs) of single bacterial genomes (PGPT-Pred), and (iii) a tool for the prediction of bacterial plant-association by marker gene identification (PIFAR-Pred). The latter was developed by Mart\u00ednez-Garc\u00eda et al. and is now hosted at University of Tuebingen. The PGPT-Pred tool is based on our new PGPT ontology, a literature- and OMICs-curated, comprehensive, and hierarchical collection of \u223c6,900 PGPTs that are associated with 6,965,955 protein sequences. To study the distribution of the PGPTs across different environments, we applied it to 70,540 bacterial strains associated with (i) seven different environments (including plants), (iii) five different plant spheres (organs), and (iii) two bacteria-induced plant phenotypes. This analysis revealed that plant-symbiotic bacteria generally have a larger genome size and a higher count of PGPT-annotated protein encoding genes. Obviously, not all reported PGPTs are restricted to -or only enriched in-plant-associated and plant symbiotic bacteria. Some also occur in human- and animal-associated bacteria, perhaps due to the transmission of PGP bacteria (PGPBs) between environments, or because some functions are involved in adaption processes to various environments. Here we provide an easy-to-use approach for screening of PGPTs in bacterial genomes across various phyla and isolation sites, using PLaBA-db, and for standardized annotation, using PGPT-Pred. We believe that this resource will improve our understanding about the entire PGP processes and facilitate the prediction of PGPB as bio-inoculants and for biosafety strategies, so as to help to establish sustainable and targeted bacteria-incorporated plant production systems in the future.","","Myo-inositol oxygenase (MIOX) is the first enzyme in the inositol route to ascorbate (L-ascorbic acid, AsA, vitamin C). We have previously shown that Arabidopsis plants constitutively expressing MIOX have elevated foliar AsA content and displayed enhanced growth rate, biomass accumulation, and increased tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses. In this work, we used a combination of transcriptomics, chromatography, microscopy, and physiological measurements to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms mediating the phenotype of the AtMIOX4 line. Transcritpomic analysis revealed increased expression of genes involved in auxin synthesis, hydrolysis, transport, and metabolism, which are supported by elevated auxin levels both in vitro and in vivo, and confirmed by assays demonstrating their effect on epidermal cell elongation in the AtMIOX4 over-expresser plants. Additionally, we detected up-regulation of transcripts involved in photosynthesis that was validated by increased efficiency of the photosystem II and proton motive force. We also found increased expression of amylase leading to higher intracellular glucose levels. Multiple gene families conferring plants tolerance to cold, water limitation, and heat stresses were found to be elevated in the AtMIOX4 line. Interestingly, the high AsA plants also displayed up-regulation of transcripts and hormones involved in defense including jasmonates, defensin, glucosinolates, and transcription factors that are known to be important for biotic stress tolerance. These results overall indicate that elevated levels of auxin and glucose, and enhanced photosynthetic efficiency in combination with up-regulation of abiotic stresses response genes underly the higher growth rate and abiotic stresses tolerance phenotype of the AtMIOX4 over-expressers.","Background A diet rich in cruciferous vegetables is reported to have beneficial health effects, partially mediated by 4-methylsulfinylbutyl glucosinolate, or glucoraphanin, which is predominantly found within broccoli (Brassica oleracea var italica). We describe the downstream effects on transcription and metabolism in broccoli following the introgression of a genetic variant of MYB28 into broccoli from a wild Brassica relative which has previously been associated with enhancement of glucoraphanin.","Capirona (Calycophyllum spruceanum (Benth.) K. Schum.) and Bolaina (Guazuma crinita Lam.) are fast-growing Amazonian trees with increasing demand in timber industry. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the content of cellulose, hemicellulose, holocellulose and lignin in juvenile tress to accelerate forest breeding programs. The aim of this study was to identify chemical differences between apical and basal stem of Capirona and Bolaina to develop models for estimating the chemical composition using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra. FTIR-ATR spectra were obtained from 150 samples for each specie that were 1.8 year-old. The results showed significant differences between the apical and basal stem for each species in terms of cellulose, hemicellulose, holocellulose and lignin content. This variability was useful to build partial least squares (PLS) models from the FTIR spectra and they were evaluated by root mean squared error of predictions (RMSEP) and ratio of performance to deviation (RPD). Lignin content was efficiently predicted in Capirona (RMSEP = 0.48, RPD &gt; 2) and Bolaina (RMSEP = 0.81, RPD &gt; 2). In Capirona, the predictive power of cellulose, hemicellulose and holocellulose models (0.68 &lt; RMSEP &lt; 2.06, 1.60 &lt; RPD &lt; 1.96) were high enough to predict wood chemical composition. In Bolaina, model for cellulose attained an excellent predictive power (RMSEP = 1.82, RPD = 6.14) while models for hemicellulose and holocellulose attained a good predictive power (RPD &gt; 2.0). This study showed that FTIR-ATR together with PLS is a reliable method to determine the wood chemical composition in juvenile trees of Capirona and Bolaina.","","Nephron endowment is defined by fetal kidney growth and critically dictates renal health in adults. Despite the advances in understanding the molecular regulation of nephron progenitors, the causes for low congenital nephron count and contribution of basic metabolism to nephron progenitor biology remain poorly understood. Here we characterized the metabolic consequences of MAPK/ERK-deficiency in nephron progenitors, whose maintenance and propagation in developing kidney critically depends on ERK activation. Our LC/MS-based metabolomics profiling identified 42 reduced metabolites, of which 26 were further supported by in vivo transcriptional characterization of MAPK/ERK-deficient nephron progenitors. This revealed a severe shortage of energy and nucleotide biosynthesis precursors, blockage in glycolysis and diminished pyruvate and proline metabolism. Utilization of in vitro kidney cultures demonstrated a dosage-specific function for glycolytic pyruvate as an energy source that controls the shape of the ureteric bud tip kwon to serve as a niche for nephron progenitor regulation. Analysis of the proline biosynthesis effects in developing kidney in vivo revealed premature loss of nephron progenitor maintenance in the absence of Pycr1/2 functions. Our results suggest that MAPK/ERK-dependent nephron progenitor metabolism functionally contributes to progenitor preservation by controlling pyruvate availability and proline metabolism in developing kidneys.","Objective: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been proposed as signaling molecules mediating exercise training adaptation, but the ROS source has remained unclear. This study aimed to investigate the requirement for NADPH oxidase (NOX)2-dependent redox changes induced by acute and long-term high-intensity interval training (HIIT) in skeletal muscle in a mouse model lacking functional NOX2 complex due to deficient p47phox (Ncf1) subunit expression (ncf1* mutation).\nMethods: HIIT was investigated after an acute bout of exercise and after a chronic intervention (3x week for 6 weeks) in wildtype (WT) vs. NOX2 activity-deficient (ncf1*) mice. NOX2 activation during HIIT was measured using a genetically-encoded biosensor. Immunoblotting and single-fiber staining were performed to measure classical exercise-training responsive endpoints in skeletal muscle. \nResults: A single bout of HIIT increased NOX2 activity measured using electroporated p47roGFP oxidation immediately after exercise but not 1h after exercise. After a 6-week of HIIT regime, improvements in maximal running capacity and some muscle training-markers responded less to HIIT in the ncf1* mice compared to WT, including superoxide dismutase (SOD)2, catalase, hexokinase II (HK II), pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and protein markers of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation complexes. Strikingly, HIIT-training increased mitochondrial network area and decreased fragmentation in WT mice only.\nConclusion: This study provided evidence that HIIT exercise activates NOX2 complex in skeletal muscle and that the presence of functional NOX2 is required for specific skeletal muscle adaptations to HIIT relating to antioxidant defense, glucose metabolism, and mitochondria.","","The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a biomarker of systemic inflammation and measures innate-adaptive immune system balance. The omega-3-index (O3I) measures the amount of EPA+DHA in blood. Both a low O3I and an elevated NLR are associated with increased risk for chronic disease and mortality, including cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Hypothesizing that low O3I may partly contribute to systemic chronic inflammation, we asked if a relationship existed between O3I and NLR in healthy adults (\u226518y, n=28,871, 51% female) without inflammation [C-reactive protein (CRP) &lt;3mg/mL)] who underwent a routine clinical assessment. NLR was inversely associated with O3I before (p&lt;0.0001) and after adjusting for age, sex, BMI, and CRP (p&lt;0.0001). Pearson correlations of other variables with NLR were r=0.06 (CRP), r=0.14 (age), and r=0.01(BMI). In this healthy population, an O3I &lt;6.6% was associated with increasing NLR whereas NLR remained relatively constant (low) when O3I &gt;6.6%, suggestive of a quiescent, balanced immune system.","","Midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons are associated with locomotor and psychiatric disorders. DA subtype is specified in ancestral neural precursor cells (NPCs) and maintained throughout neuronal differentiation. Here we show that endogenous expression of MeCP2 coincides with DA subtype specification in mouse mesencephalon, and premature expression of MeCP2 prevents in vitro cultured NPCs from acquiring DA subtype through interfering NURR1 transactivation of DA phenotype genes. By contrast, MeCP2 overexpression does not disturb DA subtype in DA neurons. By analyzing the dynamic change of DNA methylation along DA neuronal differentiation at the promoter of DA phenotype gene tyrosine hydroxylase (Th), we show that Th expression is determined by TET1-mediated de-methylation of NURR1 binding sites within Th promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that MeCP2 dominates the DNA binding of the corresponding sites thereby blocking TET1 function in DA NPCs, whereas TET1-mediated de-methylation prevents excessive MeCP2 binding in DA neurons. The significance of temporal DNA methylation status is further confirmed by targeted methylation/demethylation experiments showing that targeted de-methylation in DA NPCs protects DA subtype specification from MeCP2 overexpression, whereas targeted methylation disturbs subtype maintenance in MeCP2-overexpressed DA neurons. These findings suggest the appropriate timing of MeCP2 expression as a novel determining factor for guiding NPCs into DA lineage.","Preeclampsia (PE), a leading cause of maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity, is characterized by an increase in S-nitrosylated (SNO) proteins and reactive oxygen species (ROS), suggesting a pathophysiologic role for dysregulation in nitrosylation and nitrosative stress. Here we show that mice lacking S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR\u2212/\u2212), a denitrosylase regulating protein S-nitrosylation, exhibit a PE phenotype, including hypertension, proteinuria, renal pathology, cardiac concentric hypertrophy, decreased placental vascularization, and fetal growth retardation. ROS, nitric oxide (NO) and peroxynitrite levels are elevated. Importantly, mass spectrometry reveals elevated placental SNO-amino acid residues in GSNOR\u2212/\u2212 mice. Ascorbate reverses the phenotype except for fetal weight, reduces the difference in the S-nitrosoproteome, and identifies a unique set of SNO-proteins in GSNOR\u2212/\u2212 mice. Therefore, deficiency of GSNOR creates dysregulation of placental S-nitrosylation and preeclampsia in mice, which can be rescued by ascorbate. These findings offer valuable insights and therapeutic implications for PE.","","","","Investigations into intracellular replication and differentiation of Trypanosoma cruzi within the mammalian host have been restricted by limitations in our ability to detect parasitized cells throughout the course of infection. We have overcome this problem by generating genetically modified parasites that express a bioluminescent/fluorescent fusion protein. By combining in vivo imaging and confocal microscopy, this has enabled us to routinely visualise murine infections at the level of individual host cells. These studies reveal that intracellular parasite replication is an asynchronous process, irrespective of tissue location or disease stage. Furthermore, using TUNEL assays and EdU labelling, we demonstrate that within individual infected cells, replication of both mitochondrial (kDNA) and nuclear genomes is not co-ordinated within the parasite population, and that replicating amastigotes and non-replicating trypomastigotes can co-exist in the same cell. Finally, we report the presence of distinct non-canonical morphological forms of T. cruzi in the mammalian host. These appear to represent transitional forms in the amastigote to trypomastigote differentiation process. Therefore, the intracellular life-cycle of T. cruzi in vivo is more complex than previously realised, with potential implications for our understanding of disease pathogenesis, immune evasion and drug development. Dissecting the mechanisms involved will be an important experimental challenge.","","","","The non-animal peroxidases belong to a superfamily of oxidoreductases that reduce the hydrogen peroxide and oxidize numerous substrates. Since their initial characterization in 1992, several advances have provided an understanding into the origin and evolutionary history of this family of proteins. Here, we report for the first time an exhaustive evolutionary analysis of non-animal peroxidases using integrated in silico and biochemical strategies. Thanks to the availability of numerous genomic sequences from many species belonging to different kingdoms together with expert and exhaustive annotation of peroxidase sequences centralized in a dedicated database, we have deepened our understanding of the evolutionary process underlying non-animal peroxidases through phylogenetic reconstructions. We analysed the distribution of all non-animal peroxidases in more than 200 eukaryotic organisms in silico. First, we show that the presence or absence of non-animal peroxidases can be correlated with the presence or absence of certain organelles or with specific biological processes. Examining a wide range of organisms, we confirmed that ascorbate peroxidases (APx) and cytochromes c peroxidases (CcP) were detected respectively in chloroplast and mitochondria containing organisms. Plants, which contain both organelles, are an exception and contain only APxs without CcP. Class III peroxidases (CIII Prx) were only detected in plants and Class II peroxidases (CII Prx) in fungi related to wood decay and plant degradation.","Diet modulates the gut microbiome, and gut microbes, in turn, can impact the immune system. Here, we used two gut microbiota-targeted dietary interventions, plant-based fiber or fermented foods, to determine how each influences the human microbiome and immune system in healthy adults. Using a 17-week randomized, prospective study design combined with -omics measurements of microbiome and host, including extensive immune profiling, we found distinct effects of each diet. High-fiber consumers showed increased gut microbiome-encoded glycan-degrading CAZymes despite stable community diversity. Three distinct immunological trajectories in high fiber-consumers corresponded to baseline microbiota diversity. Alternatively, the high-fermented food diet steadily increased microbiota diversity and decreased inflammatory markers. The data highlight how coupling dietary interventions to deep and longitudinal immune and microbiome profiling can provide individualized and population-wide insight. Our results indicate that fermented foods may be valuable in countering the decreased microbiome diversity and increased inflammation pervasive in the industrialized society.","","","Repression of germline-promoting genes in somatic cells is critical for somatic development and function. To study how germline genes are repressed in somatic tissues, we analyzed key histone modifications in three Caenorhabditis elegans synMuv B mutants, lin-15B, lin-35, and lin-37, all of which display ectopic expression of germline genes in the soma. LIN-35 and LIN-37 are members of the conserved DREAM complex. LIN-15B has been proposed to work with the DREAM complex but has not been shown biochemically to be a complex member. We found that in wild-type worms synMuv B target genes and germline genes are enriched for the repressive histone modification dimethylation of histone H3 on lysine 9 (H3K9me2) at their promoters. Genes with H3K9me2 promoter localization are distributed across the autosomes and not biased toward autosomal arms like broad H3K9me2 domains. Both synMuv B targets and germline genes display dramatic reduction of H3K9me2 promoter localization in lin-15B mutants, but much weaker reduction in lin-35 and lin-37 mutants. This is the first major difference reported between lin-15B and DREAM complex mutants, which likely represents a difference in molecular function for these synMuv B proteins. In support of the pivotal role of H3K9me2 in regulation of germline genes through LIN-15B, global loss of H3K9me2 but not H3K9me3 results in phenotypes similar to synMuv B mutants, high temperature larval arrest and ectopic expression of germline genes in the soma. We propose that LIN-15B-driven enrichment of H3K9me2 on promoters of germline genes contributes to repression of those genes in somatic tissues.","Introduction Dietary nitrate lowers blood pressure and improves athletic performance in humans, yet data supporting observations that it may increase cerebral blood flow and improve cognitive performance are mixed. Here we tested the hypothesis that nitrate and nitrite treatment would improve indicators of learning and cognitive performance in a zebrafish (Danio rerio) model. We also explored the extent to which nitrate and nitrite treatment affected the brain metabolome in order to understand how nitrate and nitrite supplementation may affect indices of cognitive function.","The effect of Vitamin C (Vc) in oncotherapy was controversial for decades. And hyperactivation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) drove tumorigenesis. Herein, we demonstrated that Vc activated ERK through sodium-dependent Vc transporter 2 (SVCT2), while high-dose Vc resulted in persistent ERK feedback inhibition following activation. Extracellular Vc binding to SVCT2 initiated ERK activation, then transmembrane transport of Vc induced dimerization of SVCT2. Activated ERK phosphorylated protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 12 (PTPN12) at Ser434 and inhibited PTPN12 activity, thus enhancing phosphorylation of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), which phosphorylated growth factor receptor bound protein 2 (GRB2) at Tyr160 to promote GRB2 dimers dissociation and recruitment of GRB2 to SVCT2, leading to further ERK activation. Different cancers have different sensitivities to Vc, the dose effects of Vc on cancer phenotypes depended on that ERK was activated or inhibited. These findings suggest SVCT2 is a Vc receptor mediating the ERK-PTPN12-JAK2-GRB2-ERK positive feedback loop and a potential target for oncotherapy.","Ultraviolet A light (UVA) is commonly emitted by nail polish dryers with recent reports suggesting that long-term use of UV-nail polish dryers may increase the risk for developing skin cancer. However, no experimental evaluation has been conducted to reveal the effect of radiation emitted by UV-nail polish dryers on mammalian cells. Here, we examine the pre-mutagenic and mutagenic changes imprinted on the genomes of human and murine primary cell models due to irradiation by a UV-nail dryer. Our findings demonstrate that radiation from UV-nail devices is cytotoxic and genotoxic. Importantly, high levels of reactive oxygen species were observed in all irradiated samples. Analysis of somatic mutations revealed a dose-dependent increase of C:G&gt;A:T substitutions in irradiated samples with a pattern consistent to the one of COSMIC signature 18, a mutational signature attributed to reactive oxygen species. Examination of previously generated skin cancer genomics data revealed that signature 18 is ubiquitously present in melanoma and that it accounts for ~12% of the observed driver mutations. In summary, this study demonstrates that radiation emitted by UV-nail polish dryers can both damage DNA and can permanently imprint somatic mutations on the genomes of mammalian cells. These results have far reaching implications in regard to public health and to preventing skin cancer due to occupational- or consumer-based exposure to ultraviolet light from artificial sources.","The purpose of this study is to elucidate the apoptotic activity of Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharide (GLP) in a human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 in vitro. According to DPPH assay, GLP showed a good antioxidant (IC50 value is 202.4 \u03bcg/mL). Based on MTT assay, the results showed that GLP inhibits MCF-7 cells proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner (p&lt;0.001). IC50 values of the cytotoxicity of GLP and doxorubin were 110.907 \u03bcg/mL and 58.206 \u03bcg/mL respectively. The results from the flow cytometry indicated that GLP could induce apoptotic activity through inducing the up-regulation of the Bax and Caspase-9 and the down-regulation of the BcL-2 in MCF-7 cells. At 2\u00d7IC50, GLP increased the early-apoptotic and dead cells of MCF-7 from 18.23% to 34.76% and 8.45% to16.34% respectively. In conclusion, the GLP shows anticancer activity against MCF-7 through preventing the proliferation and inducing the apoptosis of MCF-7 cells. Our data provide the potential molecular targets in cancer prevention and reveal the key barriers in the current anticancer drugs development.","Around 60% of in vitro fertilized (IVF) human embryos irreversibly arrest before compaction between the 3-8-cell stage, posing a significant clinical problem. The mechanisms behind this arrest are unclear. Here, we show that the arrested embryos enter a quiescent-like state, marked by cell cycle arrest, the downregulation of ribosomes and histones and downregulation of MYC and p53 activity. Mechanistically, the arrested embryos can be divided into three types. Type I embryos fail to complete the maternal-zygotic transition, and type II/III embryos have erroneously low levels of glycolysis and variable levels of oxidative phosphorylation. Treatment with resveratrol or nicotinamide riboside (NR) can partially rescue the arrested phenotype. The mechanism of reactivation involves the upregulation of SIRT1, and activation of glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation which forces the embryos out of a quiescent state. Overall, our data reveal how human embryo arrest can be overcome by modulating metabolic pathways.","Rationale The preliminary reports of COVID Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (COVIDARDS) suggest the existence of a subset of patients with higher lung compliance despite profound hypoxemia. Understanding heterogeneity seen in patients with COVIDARDS and comparing to non-COVIDARDS may inform tailored treatments.","\u03b2 cells may participate and contribute to their own demise during Type 1 diabetes (T1D). We identified a novel role of Tet2 in regulating immune killing of \u03b2 cells. Tet2 is induced in murine and human \u03b2 cells with inflammation but its expression is reduced in surviving \u03b2 cells. Tet2-KO mice that receive WT bone marrow transplants develop insulitis but not diabetes and islet infiltrates do not eliminate \u03b2 cells even though immune cells from the mice can transfer diabetes to NOD/scid recipients. Tet2-KO \u03b2 cells show reduced expression of inflammatory genes, associated with closed transcription factor binding sites. Tet2-KO recipients are protected from transfer of disease by diabetogenic immune cells. We conclude that Tet2 regulates pathologic interactions between \u03b2 cells and immune cells and controls intrinsic protective pathways. Modulating TET2 may enable survival of \u03b2 cells or their replacements in the setting of pathologic immune cells.","The distribution, dynamics and function of RNA structures in human development is under- explored. Here, we systematically assayed RNA structural dynamics and its relationship with gene expression, translation and decay during human neurogenesis. We observed that the human ESC transcriptome is globally more structurally accessible than that of differentiated cells; and undergo extensive RNA structure changes, particularly in the 3\u2019UTR. Additionally, RNA structure changes during differentiation is associated with translation and decay. We also identified stage-specific regulation as RBP and miRNA binding, as well as splicing is associated with structure changes during early and late differentiation, respectively. Further, RBPs serve as a major factor in structure remodelling and co-regulates additional RBPs and miRNAs through structure. We demonstrated an example of this by showing that PUM2-induced structure changes on LIN28A enable miR-30 binding. This study deepens our understanding of the wide-spread and complex role of RNA-based gene regulation during human development.","The discovery of neutrophil subtypes has expanded what is known about neutrophil functions, yet there is still much to learn about the role of these subtypes during bacterial infection. We investigated whether Campylobacter jejuni induced differentiation of human neutrophils into the hypersegmented, CD16hi/CD62Llo subtype. In addition, we investigated whether C. jejuni-dependent differentiation of this neutrophil subtype induced cancer promoting activities of human T cells and colonocytes, which were observed in other studies of hypersegmented, CD16hi/CD62Llo neutrophils. We found that C. jejuni causes a significant shift in human neutrophil populations to the hypersegmented, CD16hi/CD62Llo subtype and that those populations exhibit delayed apoptosis, elevated arginase-1 expression, and increased reactive oxygen species production. Furthermore, incubation of C. jejuni-infected neutrophils with human T cells resulted in decreased expression of the \u03b6-chain of the T cell receptor (TCR\u03b6), which was restored upon supplementation with exogenous L-arginine. In addition, incubation of C. jejuni-infected neutrophils with human colonocytes resulted in increased HIF-1\u03b1 stabilization and NF-\u03baB activation in those colonocytes, which may result in the upregulation of pro-tumorigenic genes. This response, coupled with the ability of C. jejuni-infected neutrophils to suppress TCR\u03b6 expression in T cells, could result in the promotion of colorectal tumorigenesis during infection with C. jejuni.","","Adult molluscs produce shells with diverse morphologies and ornamentations, different colour patterns and microstructures. The larval shell however, is a phenotypically more conserved structure. How do developmental and evolutionary processes generate varying diversity at different life history stages? Using live-imaging, histology, scanning electron microscopy and transcriptomic profiling, we have described shell development in a heteroconchian bivalve the Antarctic clam, Laternula elliptica and compared it to adult shell secretion processes in the same species. Adult downstream shell genes, such as those encoding extracellular matrix proteins and biomineralisation enzymes, were largely not expressed during shell development, and instead, a development-specific downstream gene repertoire was expressed. Upstream regulatory genes such as transcription factors and signalling molecules were conserved between developmental and adult shell secretion. Comparing heteroconchian transcriptomic data with recently reported pteriomorphian larval shell proteome data suggests that, despite being phenotypically more conserved, the downstream effectors constituting the larval shell \u201ctool-kit\u201d may be as diverse as that of adults. Overall, our new data suggests that a larval shell formed using development-specific downstream effector genes is a conserved and ancestral feature of the bivalve lineage, and possibly more broadly across the molluscs.","Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD) and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) share a common hallmark of insulin resistance. Besides Insulin Receptor (IR), two non-canonical RTKs, ALK and RYK, exhibit significant and consistent functional downregulation in post-mortem AD and T2D tissues. Incidentally, both have Grb2 as a common downstream adapter and NOX4 as a common ROS producing factor. Here we show that Grb2 and NOX4 play critical roles in reducing the severity of both the diseases. The study demonstrates that the abundance of Grb2 in degenerative conditions, in conjunction with NOX4, reverse cytoskeletal degradation by counterbalancing the network of small GTPases. PAX4, a transcription factor for both Grb2 and NOX4, emerges as the key link between the common pathways of AD and T2D. Both ALK and RYK downregulation elevate the PAX4 level by reducing its suppressor ARX via Wnt/\u03b2-Catenin signaling pathway. For the first time, this study brings together RTKs other than Insulin Receptor (IR), their common transcription factor PAX4 and both AD and T2D pathologies on a common regulatory platform.","Specialized chromatin-binding proteins are required for DNA-based processes during development. We recently established PWWP2A as direct histone variant H2A.Z interactor involved in mitosis and cranial-facial development. Here, we identify the H2A.Z/PWWP2A-associated protein HMG20A as part of several chromatin-modifying complexes including NuRD, and show that it localizes to genomic regulatory regions. Hmg20a depletion causes severe head and heart developmental defects in Xenopus laevis. Our data indicate that craniofacial malformations are caused by defects in neural crest cell (NCC) migration and cartilage formation. These developmental defects are pheno-copied in HMG20A-depleted mESCs, which show inefficient differentiation into NCCs and cardiomyocytes (CMs). Accordingly, loss of HMG20A caused striking deregulation of transcription programs involved in epithelial- mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cardiac differentiation, thereby providing insights into the regulatory circuits controlled by HMG20A. Collectively, our findings implicate HMG20A as part of the H2A.Z/PWWP2A/NuRD-axis and reveal it as a key modulator of the intricate developmental transcription programs that guide NCC and cardiomyocyte differentiation.","","","","Differentiated cell nuclei can be reprogrammed after nuclear transfer (NT) to oocytes and the produced NT embryos can give rise to cloned animals. However, development of NT embryos is often hampered by recurrent reprogramming failures, including the incomplete activation of developmental genes, yet specific genes responsible for the arrest of NT embryos are not well understood. Here, we searched for developmentally important genes among the reprogramming-resistant H3K9me3-repressed genes, and identified Alyref and Gabpb1 by siRNA screening. Gene knockout of Alyref and Gabpb1 by the CRISPR/Cas9 system resulted in early developmental arrest in mice. Single embryo RNA-seq revealed that Alyref is needed for the formation of inner cell mass. The supplement of Alyref and Gabpb1 by mRNA injection supported efficient preimplantation development of cloned embryos. Thus, our study shows that the H3K9me3-repressed genes contain developmentally required genes and the incomplete activation of such genes results in preimplantation arrest of cloned embryos.","Whether direct manipulation of Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) risk genes in monkey brain can elicit Parkinsonian phenotypes remains an unsolved issue. Here, we employed an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-delivered CRISPR/Cas9 system to directly co-edit PINK1 and DJ-1 genes in the substantia nigra (SN) region of four adult monkey brains. After the operation, two of the monkeys exhibited all classic PD symptoms, including bradykinesia, tremor, and postural instability, accompanied by severe nigral dopaminergic neuron loss (over 60%) and \u03b1-synuclein pathology. The aged monkeys were more vulnerable to gene editing by showing faster PD progression, higher final total PD scores, and severer pathologic changes compared with their younger counterparts, suggesting both the genetic and aging factors played important roles in PD development. This gene editing system can be used to develop a large quantity of genetically edited PD monkeys over a short period, thus providing a practical transgenic monkey model for future PD studies.","Nigella sativa, Carica papaya and Boswellia sacra are medicinal plants in the commonly used in folkloric medicine due to the presence of its immense therapeutic properties. Fifty (50) female albino mice weighing between 15-22g were divided into five groups of 10 mice each. Animal in group 1 served as control group and were administered distilled water while animal in group 2 were given 2ml of cisplatin (orally). Animal in group 3-5 were given orally; 100 mg/kg (low dose), 200 mg/kg (medium dose) and 400 mg/kg (high dose) of triherbal preparation. The feeding regimens lasted for 28 days. After 28 days, mammary gland and blood samples were collected for haematological and antioxidant analysis. The triherbal formula decreased the GSH and MDA levels of mice treated with 100 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg doses compare to control. The measurement of total protein content, SOD and CAT increased in treated animals compared to control. However, RBC (Red Blood Cell) counts significantly decreased in the low, medium and high dose groups (0.95\u00b10.08, 6.57\u00b10.08 and 3.55\u00b10.55 x 106 cells/mm3 respectively) compared to control (7.34\u00b10.40) at P&lt;0.05. Also, significant decreases (P&lt;0.05) in the level of the total WBC (White Blood Cell) count, platelet count, PCV (Packed Cell Volume) and Hb (haemoglobin) concentration were observed. The decreases were dose dependent. The MCH (Mean Corpuscular Haemoglobin) and MCHC (Mean Corpuscular Haemoglobin Concentration) except MCV (Mean Corpuscular Volume) significantly decreased in treated group only. The triherbal formulation exhibited significant antioxidant activities showing increased levels of SOD, CAT and Protein content due to activation of the enzyme involve in detoxification of free radicals and decreased in the level of GSH and MDA due to accumulation of peroxides and H2O2. Also, decreased in haematological parameters due to the presence of phytochemicals such as phenol, resins, saponins, sterols, tannis and terpenes in the triherbal formula. Therefore, it has potential to induce haematotoxicity hence consumption of high concentrations should be discouraged.","","Coatomer complexes function in the sorting and trafficking of proteins between subcellular organelles. Pathogenic variants in coatomer subunits or associated factors have been reported in multi-systemic disorders, i.e., coatopathies, that can affect the skeletal and central nervous systems. We have identified loss-of-function variants in COPB2, a component of the coatomer complex I (COPI), in individuals presenting with osteoporosis, fractures and developmental delay of variable severity. Because the role of COPB2 in bone has not been characterized, we studied the effect of COPB2 deficiency on skeletal development in mice and zebrafish. Copb2+/\u2212 mice showed low bone mass and decreased bone strength. In zebrafish, larvae carrying a copb2 heterozygous frameshift variant showed delayed mineralization. copb2-null embryos showed endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi disorganization, and embryonic lethality. COPB2 siRNA-treated fibroblasts showed delayed collagen trafficking with retention of type I collagen in the ER and Golgi, and altered distribution of Golgi markers. Our data suggest that COPB2 haploinsufficiency leads to disruption of intracellular collagen trafficking and osteoporosis, which may improve with ascorbic acid supplementation. This work highlights the role of COPI complex as a critical regulator of bone mass and identifies a new form of coatopathy due to COPB2 deficiency.","","","Striatal medium spiny neurons are highly susceptible in Huntington\u2019s disease (HD), resulting in progressive synaptic perturbations that lead to neuronal dysfunction and death. Non-invasive imaging techniques, such as proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS), are used in HD mouse models and patients with HD to monitor neurochemical changes associated with neuronal health. However, the association between brain neurochemical alterations and synaptic dysregulation is unknown, limiting our ability to monitor potential treatments that may affect synapse function. We conducted in vivo longitudinal 1H-MRS in the striatum followed by ex-vivo analyses of excitatory synapse density of two synaptic circuits disrupted in HD, thalamo-striatal (T-S) and cortico-striatal (C-S) pathways, to assess the relationship between neurochemical alterations and changes in synapse density. We used the zQ175(Tg/0) HD mouse model as well as zQ175 mice lacking one allele of CK2\u03b1\u2019(zQ175(Tg/0):CK2\u03b1\u2019(+/\u2212)), a kinase previously shown to regulate synapse function in HD. Longitudinal analyses of excitatory synapse density showed early and sustained reduction in T-S synapses in zQ175 mice, preceding C-S synapse depletion, which was rescued in zQ175:CK2\u03b1\u2019(+/\u2212). Changes in T-S and C-S synapses were accompanied by progressive alterations in numerous neurochemicals between WT and HD mice. Linear regression analyses showed C-S synapse number positively correlated with 1H-MRS-measured levels of GABA while T-S synapse number positively correlated with levels of alanine, phosphoethanolamine and lactate, and negatively correlated with total creatine levels.","","","","KCNMA1 forms the pore of BK K+ channels, which regulate neuronal and muscle excitability. Recently, genetic screening identified heterozygous KCNMA1 variants in a subset of patients with debilitating paroxysmal non-kinesigenic dyskinesia, presenting with or without epilepsy (PNKD3). However, the relevance of KCNMA1 mutations and the basis for clinical heterogeneity in PNKD3 has not been established. Here we evaluate the relative severity of three KCNMA1 patient variants in BK channels, neurons, and mice. In heterologous cells, BKN999S and BKD434G channels displayed gain-of-function (GOF) properties, whereas BKH444Q channels showed loss-of-function (LOF) properties. The relative degree of channel activity was BKN999S &gt; BKD434G &gt; WT &gt; BKH444Q. BK currents and action potential firing were increased, and seizure thresholds decreased, in Kcnma1N999S/WT and Kcnma1D434G/WT transgenic mice but not Kcnma1H444Q/WT mice. In a novel behavioral test for paroxysmal dyskinesia, the more severely affected Kcnma1N999S/WT mice became immobile after stress, consistent with stress-induced immobility episodes observed in PNKD3-affected individuals. Homozygous Kcnma1D434G/D434G mice showed similar immobility, but in contrast, homozygous Kcnma1H444Q/H444Q mice displayed hyperkinetic behavior. These data establish the relative pathogenic potential of patient alleles as N999S &gt; D434G &gt; H444Q and validate Kcnma1N999S/WT mice as a model for PNKD3 with increased seizure propensity.","Cells of the trophoblast lineage constitute the major part of placental tissues in higher mammals. Recent derivation of human trophoblast stem cells (TSC) from placental cytotrophoblasts (CT) and from human naive PSCs opens new opportunities for studying development and function of human placenta. Several recent reports have suggested that naive human PSCs retain an exclusive potential to give rise to bona fide TSCs. Here we report that inhibition of TGFbeta pathway and avoiding WNT stimulation, leads to direct and robust conversion of primed human pluripotent stem cells into TSCs. Systematic side by side comparative analysis showed that the latter are equivalent to previously derived TSC lines. Primed PSC derived TSC lines exhibit self-renewal, are able to differentiate into the main trophoblast lineages, and present RNA and epigenetic profiles that are indistinguishable from the TSC lines derived from placenta or naive PSCs. Our findings underscore a residual plasticity in primed human PSCs that allows converting directly into pre-implantation extra-embryonic cell lineages.","","Single-cell sequencing enables us to better understand genetic diseases, such as cancer or autoimmune disorders, which are often affected by changes in rare cells. Currently, no existing software is aimed at identifying single nucleotide variations or micro (1-50bp) insertions and deletions in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Generating high-quality variant data is vital to the study of the aforementioned diseases, among others. In this study, we report the design and implementation of Red Panda, a novel method to accurately identify variants in scRNA-seq data. Variants were called on scRNA-seq data from human articular chondrocytes, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), and simulated data stemming from the MEF alignments. Red Panda had the highest Positive Predictive Value at 45.0%, while other tools\u2014FreeBayes, GATK HaplotypeCaller, GATK UnifiedGenotyper, Monovar, and Platypus\u2014ranged from 5.8%-41.53%. From the simulated data, Red Panda had the highest sensitivity at 72.44%. We show that our method provides a novel and improved mechanism to identify variants in scRNA-seq as compared to currently-existing software.","","Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by nigrostriatal degeneration and the spreading of aggregated forms of the presynaptic protein \u03b1-synuclein (aSyn) throughout the brain. PD patients are currently only treated with symptomatic therapies, and strategies to slow or stop the progressive neurodegeneration underlying the disease\u2019s motor and cognitive symptoms are greatly needed. The time between the first neurobiochemical alterations and the initial presentation of symptoms is thought to span several years, and early neuroprotective dietary interventions could delay the disease onset or slow PD progression. In this study, we characterized the neuroprotective effects of isoflavones, a class of dietary polyphenols found in soy products and in the medicinal plant red clover (Trifolium pratense). We found that isoflavone-rich extracts and individual isoflavones rescued the loss of dopaminergic neurons and the shortening of neurites in primary mesencephalic cultures exposed to two PD-related insults, the environmental toxin rotenone and an adenovirus encoding the A53T aSyn mutant. The extracts and individual isoflavones also activated the Nrf2-mediated antioxidant response in astrocytes via a mechanism involving inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and they alleviated deficits in mitochondrial respiration. Furthermore, an isoflavone-enriched soy extract reduced motor dysfunction exhibited by rats lesioned with the PD-related neurotoxin 6-OHDA. These findings suggest that plant-derived isoflavones could serve as dietary supplements to delay PD onset in at-risk individuals and mitigate neurodegeneration in the brains of patients.","Musculoskeletal dysfunction is an age-related syndrome associated with impaired mitochondrial function and proteostasis. However, few interventions have tested targeting two drivers of musculoskeletal decline. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a transcription factor that stimulates transcription of cytoprotective genes and improves mitochondrial function. We hypothesized daily treatment with a Nrf2 activator in Hartley guinea pigs, a model of age-related musculoskeletal dysfunction, attenuates the progression of skeletal muscle mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired proteostasis, preserving musculoskeletal function. We treated 2-month- and 5-month-old male and female Hartley guinea pigs for 3 and 10 months, respectively, with the phytochemical Nrf2 activator PB125 (Nrf2a). Longitudinal assessments of voluntary mobility were measured using Any-Maze\u2122 open-field enclosure monitoring. Cumulative skeletal muscle protein synthesis rates were measured using deuterium oxide over the final 30 days of treatment. Mitochondrial oxygen consumption in permeabilized soleus muscles was measured using ex vivo high resolution respirometry. In both sexes, Nrf2a 1) increased electron transfer system capacity; 2) attenuated the disease/age-related decline in coupled and uncoupled mitochondrial respiration; and 3) attenuated declines in protein synthesis in the myofibrillar, mitochondrial, and cytosolic subfractions of the soleus. These improvements were not associated with statistically significant prolonged maintenance of voluntary mobility in guinea pigs. Collectively, these results demonstrate that treatment with an oral Nrf2 activator contributes to maintenance of skeletal muscle mitochondrial function and proteostasis in a pre-clinical model of musculoskeletal decline. Further investigation is necessary to determine if these improvements are also accompanied by slowed progression of other aspects of musculoskeletal decline.","Background Reprogramming of somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and subsequent differentiation into iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iCM) seems to be a promising strategy for cardiac regenerative therapy. However, recent failure or poor outcomes in cardiac cell therapy warrants further investigation focusing on the infarction/wound environment (site of healing) to improve the cardiac regenerative medicine. Here, using next generation sequencing (NGS), we analyzed the global transcriptome to discover the unidentified genes/pathways that are crucial for cell survival, cytoprotection and mitochondrial dynamics during the differentiation of iPSC into iCM.","Hypochlorous acid (HOCl), a powerful antimicrobial oxidant, is produced by neutrophils to fight infections. Here we show that N-chlorination, induced by HOCl concentrations encountered at sites of inflammation, converts blood plasma proteins into chaperone-like holdases that protect other proteins from aggregation. This chaperone-like conversion was reversible by antioxidants and was abrogated by prior methylation of basic amino acids. Furthermore, reversible N-chlorination of basic amino acid side chains is the major factor that converts plasma proteins into efficient activators of immune cells. Finally, HOCl-modified serum albumin was found to act as a pro-survival molecule that protects neutrophils from cell death induced by highly immunogenic foreign antigens. We propose that activation and enhanced persistence of neutrophils mediated by HOCl-modified plasma proteins, resulting in the increased and prolonged generation of ROS, including HOCl, constitutes a potentially detrimental positive feedback loop that can only be attenuated through the reversible nature of the modification involved.","","Exposure to unfamiliar odorants induces an array of repetitive defensive and non-defensive behaviors in rodents which likely reflect adaptive stress responses to the uncertain valence of novel stimuli. Mice genetically deficient for dopamine \u03b2-hydroxylase (Dbh\u2212/\u2212) lack the enzyme required to convert dopamine (DA) into norepinephrine (NE), resulting in globally undetectable NE and supranormal DA levels. Because catecholamines modulate novelty detection and reactivity, we investigated the effects of novel plant-derived odorants on repetitive behaviors in Dbh\u2212/\u2212 mice and Dbh+/\u2212 littermate controls, which have catecholamine levels comparable to wild-type mice. Unlike Dbh+/\u2212 controls, which exhibited vigorous digging in response to novel odorants, Dbh\u2212/\u2212 mice displayed excessive grooming. Drugs that block NE synthesis or neurotransmission suppressed odorant-induced digging in Dbh+/\u2212 mice, while a DA receptor antagonist attenuated grooming in Dbh\u2212/\u2212 mice. The testing paradigm elicited high circulating levels of corticosterone regardless of Dbh genotype, indicating that NE is dispensable for this systemic stress response. Odorant exposure increased NE and DA abundance in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of Dbh+/\u2212 mice, while Dbh\u2212/\u2212 animals lacked NE and had elevated PFC DA levels that were unaffected by novel smells. Together, these findings suggest that novel odorant-induced increases in central NE tone contribute to repetitive digging and reflect psychological stress, while central DA signaling contributes to repetitive grooming. Further, we have established a simple method for repeated assessment of stress-induced repetitive behaviors in mice, which may be relevant for modeling neuropsychiatric disorders like Tourette syndrome or obsessive-compulsive disorder that are characterized by stress-induced exacerbation of compulsive symptoms.","Individual fingers in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) are known to be represented separately and adjacently, forming a cortical hand map. Electrophysiological studies in monkeys show that finger amputation triggers increased selectivity to the neighbouring fingers within the deprived S1, causing local reorganisation. Neuroimaging research in humans, however, shows persistent S1 finger representation of the missing hand, even decades after amputation. We aimed to resolve these apparently contrasting evidence by examining finger representation in humans following pharmacological \u2018amputation\u2019 using single-finger nerve block and 7T neuroimaging. We hypothesised that beneath the apparent selectivity of individual fingers in the hand map, peripheral and central processing is distributed across fingers. If each finger contributes to the cortical representation of the others, then localised input loss will weaken finger representation across the hand map. For the same reason, the non-blocked fingers will stabilise the blocked finger\u2019s representation, resulting in persistent representation of the blocked finger. Using univariate selectivity profiling, we replicated the electrophysiological findings of local S1 reorganisation. However, more comprehensive analyses confirmed that local blocking reduced representation of all fingers across the entire hand area. Importantly, multivariate analysis demonstrated that despite input loss, representation of the blocked finger remained persistent and distinct from the unblocked fingers. Computational modelling suggested that the observed findings are driven by distributed processing underlying the topographic map, combined with homeostatic mechanisms. Our findings suggest that the long-standing depiction of the somatosensory hand map is misleading. As such, accounts for map reorganisation, e.g. following amputation, need to be reconsidered.","Arterial tortuosity syndrome (ATS) is a recessively inherited connective tissue disorder, mainly characterized by tortuosity and aneurysm formation of the major arteries. ATS is caused by loss-of-function mutations in SLC2A10, encoding the facilitative glucose transporter GLUT10. Former studies implicate GLUT10 in transport of dehydroascorbic acid, the oxidized form of ascorbic acid (AA). Mouse models carrying homozygous Slc2a10 missense mutations do not recapitulate the human phenotype. Since mice, in contrast to humans, are able to intracellularly synthesize AA, we generated a novel ATS mouse model, deficient for Slc2a10 as well as Gulo, which encodes for L-gulonolactone oxidase, an enzyme catalyzing the final step in AA biosynthesis in rodents. Gulo;Slc2a10 knock-out mice show mild phenotypic anomalies, which were absent in single knock-out controls. While Gulo;Slc2a10 knock-out mice do not fully phenocopy human ATS, histological and immunocytochemical analysis revealed compromised extracellular matrix formation. TGF\u03b2 signaling remained unaltered, while mitochondrial function was compromised in smooth muscle cells derived from Gulo;Slc2a10 knock-out mice. Altogether, our data add evidence that ATS is an ascorbate compartmentalization disorder, but additional factors underlying the observed phenotype in humans remain to be determined.","As a common neurological disease, epilepsy has been extensively studied. Efforts have been made on rodent and other animal models to reveal the pathogenic mechanisms of epilepsy and develop new drugs as treatment. However, the features of current epilepsy models cannot fully mimic different kinds of epilepsy in human, asking for non-human primates models of epilepsy. The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a New World monkey that is widely used to study brain function. Here, we show a natural marmoset model of generalized epilepsy. In this unique marmoset family, generalized epilepsy was successfully induced by handling operation in some individuals. We mapped the marmoset family with handling-sensitive epilepsy and found that epileptic marmoset had an autosomal dominant genetic predisposition. Those marmosets were more sensitive to epilepsy inducers pentylenetetrazol (PTZ). By electrocorticogram (ECoG) recording, we detected epileptic discharge in marmoset with history of seizures. However, there was no significant change in the overall structure of epileptic marmoset brain. In summary, we report a family of marmosets with generalized seizures induced by handling operation. This epileptic marmoset family provides insights to better understand the mechanism of generalized epilepsy and helps to develop new therapeutic methods.","Although visual processing impairments have been explored in schizophrenia (SZ), their underlying neurobiology of the visual processing impairments has not been widely studied. Also, while some research has hinted at differences in information transfer and flow in SZ, there are few investigations of the dynamics of functional connectivity within visual networks. In this study, we analyzed resting-state fMRI data of the visual sensory network (VSN) in 160 healthy control (HC) subjects and 151 SZ subjects. We estimated 9 independent components within the VSN. Then, we calculated the dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) using the Pearson correlation. Next, using k-means clustering, we partitioned the dFNCs into five distinct states, and then we calculated the portion of time each subject spent in each state, that we termed the occupancy rate (OCR). Using OCR, we compared HC with SZ subjects and investigated the link between OCR and visual learning in SZ subjects. Besides, we compared the VSN functional connectivity of SZ and HC subjects in each state. We found that this network is indeed highly dynamic. Each state represents a unique connectivity pattern of fluctuations in VSN FNC, and all states showed significant disruption in SZ. Overall, HC showed stronger connectivity within the VSN in states. SZ subjects spent more time in a state in which the connectivity between the middle temporal gyrus and other regions of VNS is highly negative. Besides, OCR in a state with strong positive connectivity between middle temporal gyrus and other regions correlated significantly with visual learning scores in SZ.","","Munc13 proteins are priming factors for SNARE-dependent exocytosis, which are activated by diacylglycerol (DAG)-binding to their C1-domain. Several Munc13 paralogs exist, but their differential roles are not well understood. We studied the interdependence of phorbolesters (DAG mimics) with Munc13-1 and ubMunc13-2 in mouse adrenal chromaffin cells. Although expression of either Munc13-1 or ubMunc13-2 stimulated secretion, phorbolester was only stimulatory for secretion when ubMunc13-2 expression dominated, but inhibitory when Munc13-1 dominated. Accordingly, phorbolester stimulated secretion in wildtype cells, or cells overexpressing ubMunc13-2, but inhibited secretion in Munc13-2/Unc13b knockout (KO) cells or in cells overexpressing Munc13-1. Phorbolester was more stimulatory in the Munc13-1/Unc13a KO than in WT littermates, showing that endogenous Munc13-1 limits the effects of phorbolester. Imaging showed that ubMunc13-2, but not Munc13-1, traffics to the plasma membrane with a time-course matching Ca2+-dependent secretion, and trafficking is independent of synaptotagmin-7 (syt7). However, in the absence of syt7, phorbolester became inhibitory for both Munc13-1 and ubMunc13-2 driven secretion, indicating that stimulatory phorbolester x Munc13-2 interaction depends obligatorily on functional pairing with syt7. Overall, DAG/phorbolester, ubMunc13-2 and syt7 form a stimulatory triad for dense-core vesicle priming.","Ascorbate (vitamin C) is an essential micronutrient in humans. The chronic severe deficiency of ascorbate, termed scurvy, has long been associated with increased susceptibility to infections. How ascorbate affects the immune system at the cellular and molecular levels remained unclear. Here, from a micronutrient screen, we identified ascorbate as a potent enhancer for antibody response by facilitating the IL-21/STAT3-dependent plasma cell differentiation in mouse and human B cells. The effect of ascorbate is unique, as other antioxidants failed to promote plasma cell differentiation. Ascorbate is critical during early B cell activation by poising the cells to plasma cell lineage without affecting the proximal IL-21/STAT3 signaling and the overall transcriptome. Consistent with its role as a cofactor for epigenetic enzymes, ascorbate potentiates plasma cell differentiation by remodeling the epigenome via TET (Ten Eleven Translocation), the enzymes responsible for DNA demethylation by oxidizing 5-methylcytosines into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). Genome-wide 5hmC profiling identified ascorbate responsive elements (EAR) at the Prdm1 locus, including a distal element with a STAT3 motif overlapped with a CpG that was methylated and modified by TET in the presence of ascorbate. The results suggest that an adequate level of VC is required for antibody response and highlight how micronutrients regulate the activity of epigenetic enzymes to regulate gene expression. Our findings imply that epigenetic enzymes can function as sensors to gauge the availability of metabolites and influence cell fate decisions.","","In the adult mammalian brain, up-regulation of serotonin via the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine increases hippocampal neurogenesis. However, research assessing the long-term effects of modulating serotonin during the developmental period on hippocampal neurogenesis, is sparse. Here we evaluated hippocampal neurogenesis early (postnatal day 12), and later in life (postnatal day 60), in the offspring of mouse dams that were administered fluoxetine in their drinking water from embryonic day 15 (E15) through postnatal day 12 (P12). Fluoxetine-exposed mice had significantly higher levels of neuronal proliferation at P12, and P60, despite cessation of fluoxetine on P12. These effects were limited to proliferation, as survival of postnatal-born hippocampal neurons was unaltered. Mice exposed to fluoxetine also showed significantly higher levels of cell death, suggesting that homeostatic mechanisms present within the hippocampus may limit integration of adult-born neurons into the existing neuronal network. These findings demonstrate modulation of serotonin during development may be sufficient to induce long-lasting changes in hippocampal neurogenesis.","Tsetse flies (Glossina spp.) vector pathogenic trypanosomes (Trypanosoma spp.) in sub-Saharan Africa. These parasites cause human and animal African trypanosomiases, which are debilitating diseases that inflict an enormous socio-economic burden on inhabitants of endemic regions. Current disease control strategies rely primarily on treating infected animals and reducing tsetse population densities. However, relevant programs are costly, labor intensive and difficult to sustain. As such, novel strategies aimed at reducing tsetse vector competence require development. Herein we investigated whether an Enterobacter bacterium (Esp_Z), which confers Anopheles gambiae with resistance to Plasmodium, is able to colonize tsetse and induce a trypanosome refractory phenotype in the fly. Esp_Z established stable infections in tsetse\u2019s gut, and exhibited no adverse effect on the survival of individuals from either group. Flies with established Esp_Z infections in their gut were significantly more refractory to infection with two distinct trypanosome species (T. congolense, 6% infection; T. brucei, 32% infection) than were age-matched flies that did not house the exogenous bacterium (T. congolense, 36% infected; T. brucei, 70% infected). Additionally, 52% of Esp_Z colonized tsetse survived infection with entomopathogenic Serratia marcescens, compared with only 9% of their wild-type counterparts. These parasite and pathogen refractory phenotypes result from the fact that Esp_Z acidifies tsetse\u2019s midgut environment, which inhibits trypanosome and Serratia growth and thus infection establishment. Finally, we determined that Esp_Z infection does not impact the fecundity of male or female tsetse, nor the ability of male flies to compete with their wild-type counterparts for mates. We propose that Esp_Z could be used as one component of an integrated strategy aimed at reducing the ability of tsetse to transmit pathogenic trypanosomes.","The use of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered regulatory T cells (Tregs) has emerged as a promising strategy to promote immune tolerance in transplantation. However, in conventional T cells (Tconvs), CAR expression is often associated with tonic signaling resulting from ligand-independent baseline activation. Tonic signaling may cause CAR-T cell dysfunction, especially when the CAR structure incorporates the CD28 costimulatory domain (CSD) rather than the 4-1BB CSD.","Prolyl 4-hydroxylases (P4Hs) catalyze post-translational hydroxylation of peptidyl proline residues. In addition to collagen P4Hs and hypoxia-inducible factor P4Hs, a poorly characterized endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized transmembrane prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4H-TM) is found in animals. P4H-TM variants are associated with the familiar neurological HIDEA syndrome. Here, the 3D structure of the soluble human P4H-TM was solved using X-ray crystallography. The structure revealed an EF-domain with two Ca2+-binding motifs inserted to the catalytic domain. A substrate-binding cavity was formed between the EF-domain and the catalytic domain. The active site contained bound Fe2+ and N-oxalylglycine. Comparison to homologous structures complexed with peptide substrates showed that the substrate interacting residues and the lid structure that folds over the substrate are conserved in P4H-TM. Differences to homologs were found in the extensive loop structures that surround the substrate-binding cavity and generate a negative surface charge. Ca2+-binding affinity of P4H-TM was determined to be within the range of physiological Ca2+ concentration in the ER. The proximity of the EF-domain to the active site suggests that Ca2+-binding is relevant to the catalytic activity. P4H-TM was found both as a monomer and a dimer in solution, but the monomer-dimer equilibrium was not regulated by Ca2+. The solved 3D structure suggests that the HIDEA variants cause loss of P4H-TM function. In conclusion, P4H-TM shares key structural elements with the known P4Hs while possessing a unique property among the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases having an EF-domain and a catalytic activity potentially regulated by Ca2+.","","","","Objectives extracellular vesicles (EVs) represent key biological mediators of several physiological functions within the cell microenvironment. Platelets are the most abundant source of EVs in the blood, contributing to the plastic and versatile behaviour of these cells. Similarly, platelet lysate (PL), the best angiogenic performer of platelet origin and routinely employed for regenerative purposes, is enriched of EVs, but their role is still too poorly discovered to be suitably exploited. Here we explored the contribution of the EVs contained in PL, by investigating the biological and molecular features related to the angiogenic capacity extrapolated from that possessed by PL.","Neural stem cells (NSCs) have great potential in the application of neurodegenerative disease therapy, drug screening and disease modeling. NSC can be generated by reprogramming from terminally differentiated cells with transcription factors or small molecules. However, current methods for producing NSCs involve the danger of integrating foreign genes into the genome and the problem of low efficiency. Here, we report an efficient method to generate NSCs from human skin-derived fibroblasts with microRNA (mir-302a) in 2-3 days. The induced NSCs (iNSCs) have more than 90% of purity. Their morphology is similar to regular NSCs, expressing key markers including Nestin, Pax6 and Sox2, and can be expanded for more than 20 passages in vitro. They can also differentiate into functional neuron progeny, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes as well. Those cells can elicit action potential, can be xeno-transplanted into the brain of immune-deficient mice, and can survive and differentiate in vivo without tumor formation. This study shows that a single part of pluripotency-inducing mir-302 cluster can drive fibroblasts reprogramming, providing a general platform for high-efficiency generation of individual-specific human NSCs for studies of neuron system development and regenerative cell therapy.","","Polysaccharides from natural sources play a significant role in the management of different cancer types including gastric cancer. In this study, we reported the effect of spirulina polysaccharide (Sp) on galectin-3 modulatory activity on gastric cancer cells. The polysaccharide was isolated from the spirulina biomass, characterized, and the in silico, in vitro studies are carried out to assess the bioactivities. The isolated Sp possessed average molecular weight of 1457 kDa, and galactose (42%) as major sugar along with Rhamnose, Arabinose, Xylose, and Mannose. Further, characterization of Sp by FT-IR and NMR spectrum indicated the presence of (\u03b21-4D) galactose sugar with galactoarabinorhamnoglycan backbone. Among the monosaccharides, galactose showed highest binding affinity with galectin-3 protein as evidenced by the in silico interaction study. The obtained Sp, inhibited the proliferation of AGS gastric cancer cells by 48 % without affecting normal NIH/3T3 cells as opposed to doxorubicin, a known anticancer drug. Also, Sp exhibited galectin-3 mediated haemagglutination inhibition with MIC of 9.37 \u03bcg/mL compared to galactose 6.25 \u03bcg/mL, sugar specific to galectin-3. The Sp treatment significantly (p&lt;0.05) lowered the expression of galectin-3 by 32 % compared to untreated control cells. In addition, Sp exhibited the potent cytoprotection in RBCs, Buccal cells, and DNA exposed to oxidants. Thus, the findings suggest that the polysaccharide from spirulina offer a promising therapeutic strategy in the management of gastric cancer in addition to its currently known nutritional and pharmaceutical applications.","","Breast cancer (BC) remains one of the deadliest and frequently diagnosed metastatic cancers worldwide. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are the cell population within the tumour niche, having an epithelial to mesenchymal (EMT) transition phenotype, high self-renewal, vigorous metastatic capacity, drug resistance, and tumour relapse. Identification of targets for induction of apoptosis is essential to provide novel therapeutic approaches in BC. Our earlier studies showed that Vitamin C induces apoptotic cell death by losing redox balance in TNBC CSCs. In this study, we have attempted to identify previously unrecognized CSC survival factors that can be used as druggable targets for bCSCs apoptosis regulators isolated from the TNBC line, MDA MB 468. After a thorough literature review, Oct-4 was identified as the most promising marker for its unique abundance in cancer and absence in normal cells and the contribution of Oct-4 to the sustenance of cancer cells. We then validated a very high expression of Oct-4 in the MDA MB 468 bCSCs population using flow-cytometry. The loss of Oct-4 was carried out using siRNA-mediated knockdown in the bCSCs, followed by assessing for cellular apoptosis. Our results indicated that Oct-4 knockdown induced cell death, changes in cellular morphology, inhibited mammosphere formation, and positive for Annexin-V expression, thereby indicating the role of Oct-4 in bCSC survival. Moreover, our findings also suggest the direct interaction between Oct-4 and Vitamin C using in silico docking. This data, hence, contributes towards novel information about Oct-4 highlighting this molecule as a novel survival factor in bCSCs.","","Caveolae have been linked to many biological functions, but their precise roles are unclear. Using quantitative whole cell proteomics of genome-edited cells, we show that the oxidative stress response is the major pathway dysregulated in cells lacking the key caveola structural protein, CAVIN1. CAVIN1 deletion compromised sensitivity to oxidative stress in cultured cells and in animals. Wound-induced accumulation of reactive oxygen species and apoptosis were suppressed in Cavin1-null zebrafish, negatively affecting regeneration. Oxidative stress triggered lipid peroxidation and induced caveolar disassembly. The resulting release of CAVIN1 from caveolae allowed direct interaction between CAVIN1 and NRF2, a key regulator of the antioxidant response, facilitating NRF2 degradation. CAVIN1-null cells with impaired negative regulation of NRF2 showed resistance to lipid peroxidation-induced ferroptosis. Thus, caveolae, via lipid peroxidation and CAVIN1 release, maintain cellular susceptibility to oxidative stress-induced cell death demonstrating a crucial role for this enigmatic organelle in cellular homeostasis and wound response.","","Widespread and sustained engagement with health-protective behaviours (i.e., hygiene and distancing) is critical to successfully managing the COVID-19 pandemic. Evidence from previous emerging infectious disease outbreaks points to the role of perceived risk, worry, media coverage, and knowledge in shaping engagement with health-protective behaviours as well as vaccination intentions. The current study examined these factors in 2,174 Australian residents. An online survey was completed between 2-9 March 2020, at an early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak in Australia. Results revealed that two thirds of respondents were at least moderately worried about a widespread COVID-19 outbreak in Australia (which subsequently occurred). Worry about the outbreak and closely following media coverage were consistent predictors of health-protective behaviours (both over the previous month, and intended behaviours in the case of a widespread outbreak) as well as vaccination intentions. Health-behaviour engagement over the previous month was lower in some demographic groups, including males and younger individuals (18-29 age group). These was a substantial mismatch between respondents\u2019 expected symptoms of infection and emerging evidence that a meaningful proportion of people who contract the novel coronavirus will experience asymptomatic infection (i.e., they will not experience symptoms associated with COVID-19). Only 0.3% of those in the current study believed that they personally would not experience any symptoms if they were infected. Uncertainty and misconceptions about COVID-19 were common, including one third of respondents who reported being unsure whether people are likely have natural or existing immunity. There was also uncertainty around whether specific home remedies (e.g., vitamins, saline rinses) would offer protection, whether the virus could spread via the airborne route, and whether the virus was human made and deliberately released. Such misconceptions are likely to cause concern for members of the public. These results point to areas of uncertainty that could be usefully targeted by public education campaigns, as well as psychological and demographic factors associated with engagement with health-protective behaviours. These findings offer potential pathways for interventions to encourage health-protective behaviours to reduce the spread of COVID-19.","","","","Methionine biosynthetic pathway, essential for the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) in the host, represents an attractive target for the development of novel anti-tuberculars. Here, we have biochemically characterized homoserine acetyl transferase (HSAT viz. MetA) of Mtb, which catalyses the first committed step of methionine and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) biosynthesis. High-throughput screening of a 2300 compound library resulted in identification of thiram, an anti-fungal organosulfur compound, as the most potent MetA inhibitor. Further analysis of thiram analogs led to the identification of orally bioavailable disulfiram (DIS, an anti-alcoholism FDA approved drug) as a novel inhibitor of MetA. Both thiram and DIS restricted the growth of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant Mtb strains in a bactericidal manner. ThermoFlour assay demonstrated direct binding of DIS with MetA. Metabolomic and transcriptomic studies showed DIS mediated perturbation of methionine and redox homeostasis, respectively, in Mtb. In concordance, the effect of DIS on Mtb growth was partially rescued by supplementation with either L-methionine as well as N-acetyl cysteine, suggesting a multi-target killing mechanism. In Mtb-infected mice, DIS administration restricted bacterial growth, increased efficacy of isoniazid, ameliorated lung pathology, modulated lung immune cell landscape and protective immune response. Taken together, our results demonstrate that DIS can be repurposed for designing an effective anti-tubercular therapy.","The eye lens is responsible for focusing and transmitting light to the retina. The lens does this in the absence of organelles yet maintains transparency for at least five decades before onset of age-related nuclear cataract (ARNC). It is hypothesized that oxidative stress contributes significantly to ARNC formation. It is additionally hypothesized that transparency is maintained by a microcirculation system (MCS) that delivers antioxidants to the lens nucleus and exports small molecule waste. Common data-ependent acquisition (DDA) methods are hindered by dynamic range of lens protein expression and provide limited context to age-related changes in the lens. In this study we utilized data-independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry to analyze the urea insoluble, membrane protein fractions of 16 human lenses subdivided into three spatially distinct lens regions to characterize age-related changes, particularly concerning the lens MCS and oxidative stress response. In this pilot cohort, we measured 4,788 distinct protein groups, 46,681 peptides, and 7,592 deamidated sequences, more than in any previous human lens DDA approach. Our results reveal age-related changes previously known in lens biology and expand on these findings, taking advantage of the rich dataset afforded by DIA. Principally, we demonstrate that a significant proteome remodeling event occurs at approximately 50 years of age, resulting in metabolic preference for anaerobic glycolysis established with organelle degradation, decreased abundance of protein networks involved in calcium-dependent cell-cell contacts while retaining networks related to oxidative stress response. Further, we identified multiple antioxidant transporter proteins not previously detected in the human lens and describe their spatiotemporal and age-related abundance changes. Finally, we demonstrate that aquaporin-5, among other proteins, is modified with age by PTMs including deamidation and truncation. We suggest that the continued accumulation of each of these age-related outcomes in proteome remodeling contribute to decreased fiber cell permeability and result in ARNC formation.","Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and frequently leads to massive heart injury and the loss of billions of cardiac muscle cells and associated vasculature. Critical work in the last two decades demonstrated that these lost cells can be partially regenerated by the epicardium, the outermost mesothelial layer of the heart, in a process that highly recapitulates its role in heart development. Upon cardiac injury, mature epicardial cells activate and undergo an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to form epicardial-derived progenitor cells (EpiPCs), multipotent progenitors that can differentiate into several important cardiac lineages, including cardiomyocytes and vascular cells. In mammals, this process alone is insufficient for significant regeneration, but it might be possible to prime it by administering specific reprogramming factors, leading to enhanced EpiPC function. Here, we show that oxytocin (OXT), a hypothalamic neuroendocrine peptide, induces epicardial cell proliferation, EMT, and migration in a model of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived epicardial cells. In addition, we demonstrate that OXT is produced after cardiac cryoinjury in zebrafish, and that it elicits significant epicardial activation promoting heart regeneration. Oxytocin signaling is also critical for proper epicardium development in zebrafish embryos. The above processes are significantly impaired when OXT signaling is inhibited chemically or genetically through RNA interference. RNA sequencing data suggests that the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) pathway is the primary mediator of OXT-induced epicardial activation. Our research reveals for the first time an evolutionary conserved brain-controlled mechanism inducing cellular reprogramming and regeneration of the injured mammalian and zebrafish heart, a finding that could contribute to translational advances for the treatment of cardiac injuries.","MicroRNA-155 (miR155) is overexpressed in various inflammatory diseases and cancer, in which bone resorption and osteolysis are frequently observed. However, the role of miR155 on osteogenesis and bone mass phenotype is still unknown. Here, we report a low bone mass phenotype in the long bone of miR155-Tg mice compared with control mice. In contrast, miR155-KO mice showed a high bone mass phenotype. miR155-KO mice showed robust bone regeneration in the ectopic and orthotopic model, but miR155-Tg mice showed compromised bone regeneration compared with the control mice. Similarly, the osteogenic differentiation potential of bone marrow stromal stem cells (BMSCs) from miR155-KO mice was robust and miR155-Tg was compromised compared with that of control mice. Moreover, miR155 knockdown in BMSCs from control mice showed higher osteogenic differentiation potential, supporting the results from miR155-KO mice. TargetScan analysis predicted S1PR1 as a target gene of miR155, which was further confirmed by luciferase assay and miR155 knockdown. S1PR1 overexpression in BMSCs robustly promoted osteogenic differentiation without affecting cell viability and proliferation. Thus, miR155 showed a catabolic effect on osteogenesis and bone mass phenotype via interaction with the S1PR1 gene, suggesting inhibition of miR155 as a potential strategy for bone regeneration and bone defect healing.","Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare autoimmune disease of unknown etiology characterized by widespread fibrosis and vascular complications. We utilized an assay for genome-wide chromatin accessibility to examine the chromatin landscape and transcription factor footprints in both endothelial cells (ECs) and fibroblasts isolated from healthy controls and patients with diffuse cutaneous (dc) SSc. In both cell types, chromatin accessibility was significantly reduced in SSc patients compared to healthy controls. Genes annotated from differentially accessible chromatin regions were enriched in pathways and gene ontologies involved in the nervous system. In addition, our data revealed that chromatin binding of transcription factors SNAI2, ETV2, and ELF1 was significantly increased in dcSSc ECs, while recruitment of RUNX1 and RUNX2 was enriched in dcSSc fibroblasts. Significant elevation of SNAI2 and ETV2 levels in dcSSc ECs, and RUNX2 levels in dcSSc fibroblasts were confirmed. Further analysis of publicly available ETV2-target genes suggests that ETV2 may play a critical role in EC dysfunction in dcSSc. Our data, for the first time, uncovered the chromatin blueprint of dcSSc ECs and fibroblasts, and suggested that neural-related characteristics of SSc ECs and fibroblasts could be a culprit for dysregulated angiogenesis and enhanced fibrosis. Targeting these pathways and the key transcription factors identified might present novel therapeutic approaches for this disease.","Background Nutritional deficiencies have many immediate and long-term effects on physical and cognitive development outcomes, with the children not achieving their full potential. A milk-based health drink fortified with micronutrients as a part of a daily balanced diet can promote physical and cognitive growth in children by increasing macronutrients and micronutrients availability in the body. The systematic analysis aims to quantify the effect of a formulated health drink on children\u2019s physical, clinical, and cognitive development outcomes.","Defective 3\u03b2-hydroxysterol-\u03947 -reductase (DHCR7) in the developmental disorder, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS), results in deficiency in cholesterol and accumulation of its precursor, 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC). Here, we show that loss of DHCR7 causes accumulation of 7-DHC-derived oxysterol metabolites, premature neurogenesis, and perturbation of neuronal localization in developing murine or human cortical neural precursors, both in vitro and in vivo. We found that a major oxysterol, 3\u03b2,5\u03b1-dihydroxycholest-7-en-6-one (DHCEO), mediates these effects by initiating crosstalk between glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and neurotrophin receptor kinase TrkB. Either loss of DHCR7 or direct exposure to DHCEO causes hyperactivation of GR and TrkB and their downstream MEK-ERK-C/EBP signaling pathway in cortical neural precursors. Moreover, direct inhibition of GR activation with an antagonist or inhibition of DHCEO accumulation with antioxidants rescues the premature neurogenesis phenotype caused by the loss of DHCR7. These results suggest that GR could be a new therapeutic target against the neurological defects observed in SLOS.","The use of natural antioxidants, in particular polyphenols such as dihydroquercetin (DHQ), in animal nutrition have recently increased in popularity. This may partly be due to the risk of increased incidences of heat stress associated with raising livestock in warmer ambient temperatures, facilitated by global warming, reducing antioxidant capacity. The current research demonstrates the effect of dietary DHQ, vitamin E and standard or high ambient temperatures on growth performance, energy and nutrient metabolism, gastrointestinal tract development (GIT), jejunal villus morphometry and antioxidant status in broiler chickens. Each of the four experimental diets were fed to 16 pens of five birds, which were allocated to four rooms (four pens in each room). The temperature in two rooms was maintained at a constant 35 \u00b0C (high temperature; HT), and the temperature in the other two rooms was gradually reduced from 27 \u00b0C at 7d of age to 22 \u00b0C at 20d of age (standard temperature; ST). Rearing birds at HT reduced: feed intake, weight gain, weight of small intestine, total GIT, liver, spleen, heart, villus height, villus surface area and lowered blood glutationperoxidase (GSH-Px). Dietary DHQ increased blood GSH-Px and total antioxidant status, increased heart weight and reduced caecal size. When fed separately, DHQ and vitamin E improved hepatic vitamin E concentration. Feeding vitamin E increased spleen and liver weights. When fed together, DHQ and vitamin E reduced villus height, villus height to crypt depth ratio and villus surface area. Temperature and antioxidants did not affect energy and nutrient metabolism. There were no effects of dietary antioxidants on growth performance of broiler chickens and there were no mortalities. At present it is unclear if feeding antioxidants (in particular DHQ) at different levels, using different dietary formulations, and rearing birds under a range of environmental conditions may be effective at enhancing production performance and bird health in hot ambient climates.","","Global warming is escalating with increased temperatures reported worldwide. Given the enormous land mass on the planet, biological capture of CO2 remains a viable approach to mitigate the crisis as it is economical and easy to implement. In this study, a gene capable of CO2 capture was identified via selection in minimal media. This mitochondrial gene named as OG1 encodes the OK/SW-CL.16 protein and shares homology with cytochrome oxidase subunit III of various species and PII uridylyl-transferase from Loktanella vestfoldensis SKA53. CO2 capture experiments indicate that \u03b413C was substantially higher in the cells harboring the gene OG1 than the control in the nutrition-poor media. This study suggests that CO2 capture using engineered microorganisms in barren land can be exploited to address the soaring CO2 level in the atmosphere, opening up vast land resources to cope with global warming.","","The critical cellular transitions that govern human pancreas development are largely unknown. We performed large-scale single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq) to interrogate human fetal pancreas development from 8-20 weeks post conception. We identified 103 distinct cell types, including four novel endocrine progenitor subtypes displaying unique transcriptional features and differentiation potency. Integration with single-nucleus Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin Sequencing (snATAC-Seq) identified candidate regulators of human endocrine cell fate and revealed development-specific regulatory annotation at diabetes risk loci. Comparison of in vitro stem cell-derived and endogenous endocrine cells predicted aberrant genetic programs leading to the generation of off-target cells. Finally, knock-out studies revealed that the gene FEV regulates human endocrine differentiation. This work establishes a roadmap of human pancreatic development, highlights previously unappreciated cellular diversity and lineage dynamics, and provides a blueprint for understanding pancreatic disease and physiology, as well as generating human stem cell-derived islet cells in vitro for regenerative medicine purposes."],"title":["Tissue-engineered collagenous fibrous cap models to systematically elucidate atherosclerotic plaque rupture","DNA-Demethylating Agents enhance cytolytic activity of CD8+ T Cells and anti-tumor immunity","Acceptability and feasibility of strategies to shield the vulnerable during the COVID-19 outbreak: a qualitative study in six Sudanese communities","Outcome of Conservative Therapy in COVID-19 Patients Presenting with Gastrointestinal Bleeding","Clinical Trial of Efficacy and Toxicity of Disoproxil Tenofovir Fumarate and Emtricitabine for Mild to Moderate SARS-CoV-2 Infections","Investigating Causal Associations of Diet-Derived Circulating Antioxidants with Risk of Six Major Mental Disorders: A Mendelian Randomization Study","Vitamin B12 and Risk of Diabetes: New insight from Cross-Sectional and Longitudinal Analyses of the China Stroke Primary Prevention Trial (CSPPT)","Clustering of Countries for COVID-19 Cases based on Disease Prevalence, Health Systems and Environmental Indicators","Targeting TGF-\u03b2 pathway with COVID-19 Drug Candidate ARTIVeda/PulmoHeal Accelerates Recovery from Mild-Moderate COVID-19","Controlled randomized clinical trial on using Ivermectin with Doxycycline for treating COVID-19 patients in Baghdad, Iraq","Risk factors for developing COVID-19: a population-based longitudinal study (COVIDENCE UK)","Effect of Ozone on Allergic Airway Inflammation","Outcome reporting from protocols of clinical trials of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): a review","The impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on university students\u2019 dietary intake, physical activity, and sedentary behaviour","BrainPhys neuronal medium optimized for imaging and optogenetics in vitro","Low plasma 25(OH) vitamin D level is associated with increased risk of COVID-19 infection: an Israeli population-based study","Indomethacin Use for Mild &amp; Moderate hospitalised Covid-19 patients: An open label randomized clinical trial","Contributions of Latin American researchers in the understanding the novel coronavirus outbreak: A literature review","Mosaic Patterns of B-vitamin Synthesis and Utilization in a Natural Marine Microbial Community","Reversal of Epigenetic Age with Diet and Lifestyle in a Pilot Randomized Clinical Trial","Therapeutic Management of COVID-19 Patients: A systematic review","Outcome of Different Therapeutic Interventions in Mild COVID-19 Patients in a Single OPD Clinic of West Bengal: A Retrospective study","A novel function of M. tuberculosis chaperonin paralog GroEL1 in copper homeostasis","Quaternary Prevention: Is this Concept Relevant to Public Health?

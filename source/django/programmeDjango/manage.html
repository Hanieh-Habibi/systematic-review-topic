To our knowledge, this concept has not been tested or evaluated in resource-poor settings. This study aimed to explore the acceptability and feasibility of strategies to shield persons at higher risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes, during the COVID-19 epidemic in six communities in Sudan.","Background/Objective There is a paucity of data on the management of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding in patients with COVID-19 amid concerns about the risk of transmission during endoscopic procedures. We aimed to study the outcomes of conservative treatment for GI bleeding in patients with COVID-19.\n","Background Observational studies have suggested associations between circulating antioxidant levels and many mental disorders, but evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is lacking and causal inferences have not been confirmed. The aim of this study was to explore whether genetically predicted diet-derived circulating antioxidants were causally associated with the risk of major mental disorders using Mendelian randomization (MR).","Introduction Previous studies in mostly Western populations, have yielded conflicting findings on the association of vitamin B12 with diabetes risk, in part, due to differences in study design and population characteristics. This study sought to examine the vitamin B12 \u2013 diabetes association in Chinese hypertensive adults by both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses.","","Chemically defined serum-free media is increasingly used as a tool to help standardize experiments by eliminating the potential variability contributed by pooled serum. These media are formulated for the culture and expansion of specific cell types, maintaining cell viability without the need for exogenous animal proteins. Formulated serum-free media could thus help improve viability and reduce variability during sample preparation for flow cytometry, yet a thorough analysis of how such media impact fluorochrome-antibody conjugates has not been performed. In this study, we expose fluorescent antibody-labeled cells or antibody capture beads to white light in the presence of various hematopoietic cell culture media and provide evidence that formulated serum-free media permit rapid light-initiated fluorescent dye degradation in a cell-independent manner. We observed fluorescence signal loss of several dyes, which included fluorescence spillover into adjacent detectors. Finally, photostability of antibody-fluorochrome conjugates in formulated serum-free media is partially restored in the presence of either serum or vitamin C, implicating reactive oxygen species in the observed signal loss. Thus, our data indicate that formulated serum-free media designed to standardize cell culture are not currently optimized for use with fluorochrome-antibody conjugates, and thus extreme caution should be exercised when using these media in cytometric experiments.","Background Low dietary diversity superimposed with poor quality monotonous diets is a major problem that often results in undernutrition, mainly micronutrient deficiencies. However, there is limited evidence on minimum dietary diversity and associated factors among lactating mothers in resource-poor settings, including the study area. Therefore, the objective of the study is to assess the prevalence of minimum dietary diversity and associated factors among lactating mothers in Ataye District, Ethiopia.","","Objectives COVID-19 patients suffer from the lack of curative therapy. Hence, there is an urgent need to try repurposed old drugs on COVID-19.","Background Risk factors for severe COVID-19 include older age, male sex, obesity, Black or Asian ethnicity and underlying medical conditions. Whether these factors also influence susceptibility to developing COVID-19 is uncertain.","Background Exposure to O3 has been associated with increased risk of exacerbations of asthma, but the underlying mechanisms are not well studied. We hypothesized that O3 exposure would enhance airway inflammatory responses to allergen and the GSTM1 null genotype would modulate this enhancement.","Objectives To examine heterogeneity of outcomes in protocols of clinical trials of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to identify outcomes for prioritization in developing a core outcome set (COS) in this field.","Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is associated with premature mortality and is an independent risk factor for a broad range of diseases, especially those associated with aging, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer\u2019s Disease. However, the pathophysiology underlying increased rates of somatic disease in MDD remains unknown. It has been proposed that MDD represents a state of accelerated cellular aging, and several measures of cellular aging have been developed in recent years. Among such metrics, estimators of biological age based on predictable age-related patterns of DNA methylation (DNAm), so called \u2018epigenetic clocks\u2019, have shown particular promise for their ability to capture accelerated aging in psychiatric disease. The recently developed DNAm metric known as \u2018GrimAge\u2019 is unique in that it was trained on time-to-death data and has outperformed its predecessors in predicting both morbidity and mortality. Yet, GrimAge has not been investigated in MDD. Here we measured GrimAge in 49 somatically healthy unmedicated individuals with MDD and 60 age-matched healthy controls. We found that individuals with MDD exhibited significantly greater GrimAge relative to their chronological age (\u2018AgeAccelGrim\u2019) compared to healthy controls (p=0.001), with a median of two years of excess cellular aging. This difference remained significant after controlling for sex, current smoking status and body-mass index (p=0.015). These findings are consistent with prior suggestions of accelerated cellular aging in MDD, but are the first to demonstrate this with an epigenetic metric predictive of premature mortality.","University students are a vulnerable group for poor dietary intake, insufficient physical activity and sedentary behaviour. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of COVID-19 on university students\u2019 dietary intake, physical activity and sedentary behaviour. Participants were students (n=125) from the Universities of Saskatchewan and Regina. An online questionnaire was administered retrospectively (for pre-pandemic) and prospectively (during the pandemic) to examine students\u2019 dietary intake, physical activity and sedentary behaviour. Overall, nutrient and caloric intakes were significantly reduced (p&lt;0.05) during the pandemic, and alcohol intake increased (p=0.03). Before the pandemic, 16% and 54% of the participants were meeting the Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines for Adults (18\u201364 years) of 150 minutes of moderate-vigorous physical activity and 8 hours or less of sedentary activity respectively. Only 10% met the guidelines for physical activity while 30% met the guidelines for sedentary behaviour during the pandemic. The minutes per week spent engaging in moderate to vigorous physical activity during the pandemic decreased by approximately 20% (p&lt;0.001). The hours spent in sedentary activities increased by 3 hours per day (p&lt;0.001). Our findings confirm that during the pandemic, students\u2019 inadequate dietary intake, high alcohol consumption, low physical activity and high sedentary behaviour were significantly compounded.","Background While COVID-19 remains largely unclear and mortality continues to raise, early effective approaches prior to complications lack, as well as researches for characterization and therapeutical potential options in actual early COVID-19. Although females seem to be less affected than females, hyperandrogenic (HA) phenotype, like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), idiopathic hirsutism, congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) female androgenetic alopecia (AGA), or idiopathic HA may be at higher risk due to its inherent enhanced androgenic activity. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of any early pharmacological approach to females diagnosed with COVID-19 before seven days of symptoms, as well as investigate whether HA is an additional risk factor in this population.","The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a biomarker of systemic inflammation and measures innate-adaptive immune system balance. The omega-3-index (O3I) measures the amount of EPA+DHA in blood. Both a low O3I and an elevated NLR are associated with increased risk for chronic disease and mortality, including cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Hypothesizing that low O3I may partly contribute to systemic chronic inflammation, we asked if a relationship existed between O3I and NLR in healthy adults (\u226518y, n=28,871, 51% female) without inflammation [C-reactive protein (CRP) &lt;3mg/mL)] who underwent a routine clinical assessment. NLR was inversely associated with O3I before (p&lt;0.0001) and after adjusting for age, sex, BMI, and CRP (p&lt;0.0001). Pearson correlations of other variables with NLR were r=0.06 (CRP), r=0.14 (age), and r=0.01(BMI). In this healthy population, an O3I &lt;6.6% was associated with increasing NLR whereas NLR remained relatively constant (low) when O3I &gt;6.6%, suggestive of a quiescent, balanced immune system.","","Introduction Indomethacin, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), has been presented as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent. This randomised clinical trial in a hospital setting evaluated the efficacy and safety of this drug in RT-PCR-positive coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.","","Manipulations to set back biological age and extend lifespan in animal models are well established, and translation to humans has begun. The length of human life makes it impractical to evaluate results by plotting mortality curves, so surrogate markers of age have been suggested and, at present, the best established surrogates are DNA methylation clocks. Herein we report on a randomized, controlled clinical trial designed to be a first step in evaluating the effect of a diet and lifestyle intervention on biological age. Compared to participants in the control group (n=20), participants in the treatment group tested an average 3.23 years younger at the end of the eight-week program according to the Horvath DNAmAge clock (p=0.018). Those in the treatment group (n=18) tested an average 1.96 years younger at the end of the program compared to the same individuals at the beginning with a strong trend towards significance (p=0.066 for within group change). This is the first such trial to demonstrate a potential reversal of biological age. In this study, the intervention was confined to diet and lifestyle changes previously identified as safe to use. The prescribed program included multiple components with documented mechanistic activity on epigenetic pathways, including moderate exercise, breathing exercises for stress, and a diet rich in methyl donor nutrients and polyphenols.","Standard cell culture practices require addition of animal-derived serum to culture media to achieve adequate cell growth. Typically, 5-10% by volume of fetal bovine serum (FBS) is used, which accounts for a vast majority of the cost of media while also imposing environmental and ethical concerns associated with the use of animal serum. Here we tested the efficacy of culturing cells by replacing serum in the media with algae extract and select additives. Using LC-MS, we compared molecular signatures of FBS to Chlorella algae extracts and identified NAD(H)/NADP(H) as common and relatively abundant features in their characteristic profiles. Bovine fibroblasts, cultured in serum-free media supplemented with C. vulgaris extract and just two growth factors plus insulin, showed significant growth with enhanced viability compared to control cells cultured without serum, albeit still lower than that of controls cultured with 10% FBS. Moreover, C. vulgaris extract enhanced cell viability beyond that of cells cultured with the two growth factors and insulin alone. These results suggest that key components in serum which are essential for cell growth may also be present in C. vulgaris extract, demonstrating that it may be used at least as a partial alternative to serum for cell culture applications.","Background SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of the COVID-19 that has been declared a global pandemic by the WHO in 2020. The COVID-19 treatment guidelines vary in each country, and yet there is no approved therapeutic for COVID-19.","","Introduction With over 87,273,380 cases being reported and 1,899,440 deaths worldwide as of 9th January 2021, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become the worst-hit pandemic till date. Every day clinicians are bombarded with many new treatment options that claim to be better than the others.","Objective To measure and map research output on Quaternary Prevention (P4) and outline research trends; to assess the papers content, mainly regarding methods and subjects approached in order to contribute to the improvement of global knowledge about P4 and to evaluate its relevance for public health.","","","Despite decades of clinical investigations, there is currently no effective treatment for patients diagnosed with Chronic Pancreatitis (CP). Computational drug repurposing holds promise to rapidly identify therapeutics which may prove efficacious against the disease. Using a literature-derived knowledge graph, we train multiple machine learning models using embeddings based on i) the network topology of regulation bipartite networks, ii) protein primary structures and iii) molecule substructures. Using these models, we predict approved drugs that down-regulate the disease, and assess their proposed respective drug targets and mechanism of actions. We analyse the highest predicted drugs and find a diverse range of regulatory mechanisms including inhibition of fibrosis, inflammation, immmune response, oxidative stress and calcium homeostasis. Notably, we identify resiniferatoxin, a potent analogue of capsaicin, as a promising repurposable candidate due to its antiinflammatory properties, nociceptive pain suppression, and regulation of calcium homeostatis (through potentiation of mutant cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)). Resiniferatoxin may also regulate intracellular acinar Ca2+ via agonism of transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily member 6 (TRPV6). We believe the potential of this repurposable drug warrants further in silico and in vitro testing, particularly the affect of the TRPV6 agonism on disease pathogenesis.","","","IMPORTANCE Genes and lifestyle factors influence progression to advanced age-related macular degeneration (AAMD). However, the impact of genetic and behavioral factors on age when this transition occurs has not been evaluated prospectively.","","Nineteenth century medical understanding of human metabolism was limited, therefore, the incidence of metabolic deficiencies was not fully recorded. In addition, the transition from agricultural based mode of life to the industrial one significantly changed the pattern of these metabolic deficiencies. They were further altered by colonisation of distant continents. Palaeopathological study of skeletal remains from the early industrialised colonial era allowed light to be shed on the metabolic stresses produced by this new mode of life. Aims of this study were to investigate manifestations of disease in skeletal remains from 65 (20 adults, 45 sub-adults) migrant settlers buried in the \u201cfree ground\u201d of St Mary\u2019s Anglican Church Cemetery (1847 to 1927). An area allocated for burials paid for by the South Australian Government. Skeletal manifestations were determined and interpreted in terms of their multiple aetiologies. Findings were compared with those published for two 19th century British samples. Skeletal manifestations, commonly related to metabolic deficiencies, were observed. Areas of abnormal porosity of bone cortices were seen in 9 adults and 12 sub-adults, flaring of metaphyses was seen in one sub-adult, flaring of costochondral junctions of the ribs was seen in one sub-adult. Porous lesions of orbital roof bones (Types 3 to 5) were seen on three sub-adults. Micro-CT scans of tooth samples located interglobular dentine in three individuals. Comparison of St Mary\u2019s findings with St Martins, Birmingham, and St Peter\u2019s, Wolverhampton, UK, showed more individuals from St Mary\u2019s had areas of abnormal porosity of bone cortices possibly related to vitamin C deficiency. However, St Mary\u2019s sample displayed fewer changes attributable to vitamin D deficiency as expected in a country with greater UV irradiation. This indicates that, although the early industrialisation produced metabolic stresses, change of the environment through colonisation of new continents altered the distribution of metabolic deficiencies.","","Objective The study intended to understand the effect of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on western Indian elderly care homes. The study aimed to know the actions taken by administration of homes and challenges faced during the lockdown period.","The confirmed number of SARS-CoV-2 infections up to 30 August 2021 is 217 mil. worldwide but information about factors affecting the probability of infection or of a severe course of Covid-19 remains insufficient and often speculative. Only a small number of factors have been rigorously examined, mostly by retrospective or cross-sectional studies. We ran a preregistered study on 5,164 internet users who shared with us information about their exposure to 105 risk factors and reported being Covid negative before the beginning of the fourth wave of Covid-19 in the Czech Republic. After the fourth wave, in which 709 (13.7%) of participants were infected, we used a partial Kendall test controlled for sex, age, and urbanisation to compare the risk of infection and of a severe course of the disease in subjects who originally did and did not report exposure to particular risk factors. After the correction for multiple tests, we identified 13 factors \u2013 including male sex, lower age, blood group B, and the larger household size \u2013 that increased the risk of infection and 16 factors \u2013 including mask wearing, borreliosis in the past, use of vitamin D supplements, or rooibos drinking \u2013 that decreased it. We also identified 23 factors that increased the risk of a severe course of Covid-19 and 12 factors that decreased the risk.","","Background Vitamin D levels have been reported to be associated with COVID-19 susceptibility, severity and mortality events.. We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the use of vitamin D intervention on COVID-19 outcomes.","The non-animal peroxidases belong to a superfamily of oxidoreductases that reduce the hydrogen peroxide and oxidize numerous substrates. Since their initial characterization in 1992, several advances have provided an understanding into the origin and evolutionary history of this family of proteins. Here, we report for the first time an exhaustive evolutionary analysis of non-animal peroxidases using integrated in silico and biochemical strategies. Thanks to the availability of numerous genomic sequences from many species belonging to different kingdoms together with expert and exhaustive annotation of peroxidase sequences centralized in a dedicated database, we have deepened our understanding of the evolutionary process underlying non-animal peroxidases through phylogenetic reconstructions. We analysed the distribution of all non-animal peroxidases in more than 200 eukaryotic organisms in silico. First, we show that the presence or absence of non-animal peroxidases can be correlated with the presence or absence of certain organelles or with specific biological processes. Examining a wide range of organisms, we confirmed that ascorbate peroxidases (APx) and cytochromes c peroxidases (CcP) were detected respectively in chloroplast and mitochondria containing organisms. Plants, which contain both organelles, are an exception and contain only APxs without CcP. Class III peroxidases (CIII Prx) were only detected in plants and Class II peroxidases (CII Prx) in fungi related to wood decay and plant degradation.","Objective To evaluate the efficacy of ivermectin (IVM) as an addition to the standard of care (SOC) treatment in COVID-19 patients with mild and moderate disease","BACKGROUND A key trial (NCT04308668) of post-exposure prophylaxis found hydroxychloroquine-associated (HCQ) reductions of Covid-19 by 17% overall and 31% to 49% in subgroups. To understand these trends, we re-analyzed the dataset.","Background Many nutrients have powerful immunomodulatory actions with the potential to alter susceptibility to COVID-19 infection, progression to symptoms, likelihood of severe disease and survival. The pandemic has fostered many nutrition-related theories, sometimes backed by a biased interpretation of evidence.","Objective We aimed to compare the safety and efficacy of a doxycycline-based regimen against the national standard guidelines (Hydroxychloroquine plus Azithromycin) for the treatment of mild symptomatic COVID-19.","Background COVID-19 is associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms including increased depressive, anxiety and chronic fatigue-syndrome (CFS)-like physiosomatic (previously known as psychosomatic) symptoms.","","","This work details the study of critical containment zones in Maharashtra within a time (April 9 2020 - July 31 2020) in the context of COVID-19. The effects of lockdown implementation, community isolation, environmental factors, demographic aspects, behavioural factors, diet etc. have been investigated. The effect of the aforementioned factors on the infected cases, cumulative infected cases, recoveries, cumulative recoveries, active cases, deaths and cumulative deaths are analyzed. The integrated effects of the aforementioned factors on COVID-19 outcomes are further amplified due to adequate and inadequate health facilities. The study will be helpful to scientists, researchers, pharmacists and biotechnologists in new vaccine design &amp; to accommodate above factors for the betterment of susceptible &amp; infected people of Maharashtra and similar demographies across the globe. Further, it pinpoints the need for more awareness and control strategies among the people to reduce the havoc, stress, fear, anxiety, pathogenicity and thereby reducing mortality.","","Over 95% of the COVID-19 cases are mild-to-asymptomatic who contribute to disease transmission whereas most of the severe manifestations of the disease are observed in elderly and in patients with comorbidities and dysregulation of immune response has been implicated in severe clinical outcomes. However, it is unclear whether asymptomatic or mild infections are due to low viral load or lack of inflammation. We have measured the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the respiratory samples and serum markers of inflammation in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms. We observed a bi-phasic pattern of virus load which was eventually cleared in most patients at the time of discharge. Viral load in saliva samples from a subset of patients showed good correlation with nasopharyngeal samples. Serum interferon levels were downregulated during early stages of infection but peaked at later stages correlating with elevated levels of T-cell cytokines and other inflammatory mediators such as IL-6 and TNF- \u03b1 which showed a bi-phasic pattern. The clinical recovery of patients correlated with decrease in viral load and increase in interferons and other cytokines which indicates an effective innate and adaptive immune function in mild infections. We further characterized one of the SARS-CoV-2 isolate by plaque purification and show that infection of lung epithelial cells (Calu-3) with this isolate led to cytopathic effect disrupting epithelial barrier function and tight junctions. Finally we showed that zinc was capable of inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection in this model suggesting a beneficial effect of zinc supplementation in COVID-19 infection.","Background Observational studies have demonstrated inverse associations between vegetable intake and cardiovascular diseases. However, the results are prone to residual confounding. The separate effects of cooked and raw vegetable intake remain unclear. This study aims to investigate the association between cooked and raw vegetable intake with cardiovascular outcomes using Mendelian randomization (MR).","Background SARS-CoV-2 entry into type II pneumocytes is depended on the TMPRSS2 proteolytic enzyme. The only known promoter of TMPRSS2 in humans is an androgen response element. As such, androgen sensitivity may be a risk factor for COVID-19. Previously, we have reported a retrospective cohort analysis demonstrating the protective effect of 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (5ARis) in COVID-19. Men using 5ARis were less likely to be admitted to the ICU than men not taking 5ARis. Additionally, men using 5ARis had drastically reduced frequency of symptoms compared to men not using 5ARis in an outpatient setting. Here we aim to determine if 5ARis will be a beneficial treatment if given after SARS-CoV-2 infection.","The present study was conducted to assess the behavioral preventive measures and the use of medicines and herbal foods/products among the public in response to Covid-19. A cross-sectional survey was conducted from 27 June to 20 July 2020, and 1222 people participated. Kruskal-Wallis test was used to identify the differences in behavioral preventive practices across different demographic categories. To identify the factors associated with the use of preventive medicines and herbal foods/products, multivariable logistic regression was performed. Most participants adopted the recommended preventive practices such as washing hands more frequently (87.5%), staying home more often (85.5%), avoiding crowds (86%), and wearing masks (91.6%). About half of the smokers reported a decreased rate of smoking during the pandemic. Also, 14.8% and 57.6% of the participants took medicines and herbal foods/products as preventive measures against Covid-19. Arsenicum album and Zinc supplements were the most commonly used preventive medicines. Gender, age, and fear of Covid-19 were significantly associated with the use of both preventive medicines and herbal products. For the management of Covid-19 related symptoms, Paracetamols, Fexofenadine, and Zinc supplements were used most often. Most participants sought information from non-medical sources while using medicines and herbal products. Moreover, potentially inappropriate and unnecessary use of drugs were identified.","The effect of Vitamin C (Vc) in oncotherapy was controversial for decades. And hyperactivation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) drove tumorigenesis. Herein, we demonstrated that Vc activated ERK through sodium-dependent Vc transporter 2 (SVCT2), while high-dose Vc resulted in persistent ERK feedback inhibition following activation. Extracellular Vc binding to SVCT2 initiated ERK activation, then transmembrane transport of Vc induced dimerization of SVCT2. Activated ERK phosphorylated protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 12 (PTPN12) at Ser434 and inhibited PTPN12 activity, thus enhancing phosphorylation of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), which phosphorylated growth factor receptor bound protein 2 (GRB2) at Tyr160 to promote GRB2 dimers dissociation and recruitment of GRB2 to SVCT2, leading to further ERK activation. Different cancers have different sensitivities to Vc, the dose effects of Vc on cancer phenotypes depended on that ERK was activated or inhibited. These findings suggest SVCT2 is a Vc receptor mediating the ERK-PTPN12-JAK2-GRB2-ERK positive feedback loop and a potential target for oncotherapy.","New information is emerging about SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology and immunity, but little of this information comes from low- and middle-income countries or from patients receiving care in the outpatient setting. The current study investigated the SARS-CoV-2 infection status and antibody responses in 157 patients seeking care for a respiratory disease suggestive of COVID-19 in private healthcare clinics during the first wave (June\u2013October 2020) of infections in Nicaragua. We examined nasal swabs for the presence of viral RNA via RT-PCR and longitudinally collected sera for the changes in SARS-CoV-2 Spike antibody levels over six months. Among patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, we evaluated if clinical symptoms were associated with age, hematological parameters and co-morbidities. The combination of PCR and paired serology identified 60 (38%) of the 157 outpatients as acute COVID-19. While both PCR and serology identified the majority (n = 38, 64%) of the acute infections, a notable number of outpatients were identified by RT-qPCR (n = 13, 22%) or by serology (n = 9, 14%) only. During the longitudinal study, we identified 6 new infections by serology among the 97 non-COVID-19 subjects. In conclusion, this study report that more than one third of the outpatients seeking care for acute respiratory disease during the first epidemic wave of SARS-CoV-2 in Nicaragua had an acute mild COVID-19 infection that correlate with prolonged humoral response. This immune response to the RBD antigen, more likely IgG dependent, significantly increased between the acute to convalescent and decay in the late convalescent but still remained seropositive.","Lycium barbarum, commonly known as goji berry, Chinese berry, or Tibetian berry, is emerging as a popular \u201csuperfood\u201d with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Goji berry is being used for the treatment of various cancers, gastrointestional disorders, stroke, diabetes, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and glaucoma. However, its use for management of oral inflammatory diseases has not been explored. Therefore, the present study aims to evaluate the antimicrobial, anti-adhesion, and anti-biofilm, and cytotoxic properties of an ethanolic extract of Lycium barbarum (LBE) against oral and periodontal pathogens. The antimicrobial properties of LBE against five microorganisms were tested and compared against Chlorhexidine and doxycycline along with cytotoxicity and cell viability on the gingival fibroblast and modified keratinocyte cell lines. The anti-adhesion and anti-biofilm properties of LBE against Porphyromonas gingivalis, at its minimal bactericidal value, were evaluated. The antimicrobial, anti-adhesion and antibiofilm properties of LBE were found to be comparable to chlorhexidine but less than that of doxycycline. The LBE extract was also compactible to gingival fibroblast tissues and oral keratinocytes at 1 mg/ml. The results proved that goji berry is as effective as chlorhexidine and can be used as a promising natural herb for the management of inflammatory diseases of oral cavity.","Background/Objectives Physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) represents the total volume of all physical activity. This can be accumulated as different underlying intensity profiles. Although volume and intensity have been studied in isolation, less is known about their joint association with health. We examined this association with body-fatness in a population-based sample of middle-aged British women and men.","The impact of nutrition on the metabolic profile of osteoporosis is incompletely characterized. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to detangle the association of fruit and vegetable (FV) intakes with osteoporosis prevalence. Dietary, anthropometric and blood plasma metabolite data were examined from the Boston Puerto Rican Osteoporosis Study, a cohort of 600 individuals (age 46-79yr). High FV intake was protective against osteoporosis prevalence. Associations of 525 plasma metabolites were assessed with fruit and vegetable intake, and separately with osteoporosis status. Several biological processes affiliated with the FV-associating metabolites, including caffeine metabolism, carnitines and fatty acids, and glycerophospholipids. For osteoporosis-associated metabolites, important processes were steroid hormone biosynthesis in women, and branched-chain amino acid metabolism in men. In all instances, the metabolite patterns differed greatly between sexes, arguing for a stratified nutrition approach in recommending FV intakes to improve bone health. Factors derived from principal components analysis of the FV intakes were correlated with the osteoporosis-associated metabolites, with high intake of dark leafy greens and berries/melons appearing protective in both sexes. These data warrant investigation into whether increasing intakes of dark leafy greens, berries and melons causally affect bone turnover and BMD among adults at risk for osteoporosis via sex-specific metabolic pathways, and how gene-diet interactions alter these sex-specific metabolomic-osteoporosis links.","Background Given its antioxidant activity, vitamin E is hypothesized to attenuate the age-related decline in pulmonary function.","Citrus is a valuable crop in Pakistan because it is rich in vitamin C and antioxidants. Huanglongbing (HLB) has an influence on citrus production around the world caused by a bacterium \u201cCandidatus liberibacter asiaticus\u201d (CLas), africanus and americanus. The structure and diversity of bacterial species in various ecosystems can be quickly examined using NGS. This approach is considerably quicker and more precise than outdated methods. Healthy or citrus greening infected leaf samples of Grapefruit, Citrus aurantifolia, and Citrus reticulata Blanco was used for diversity analysis. In this study high throughput, NGS technique was used to access the population of both cultivable and non-cultivable bacterial endophytes from citrus leaves, by using PCR amplicons of 16S rDNA sequences (V5\u2013V7 regions) with Illumina Hi seq. As a result, a total number of 68,722 sequences were produced from the test samples. According to the NGS-based diversity classification, the most common genera of exploited bacterial endophytes were Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroides, Cyanobacteria, and Actinobacteria. Citrus aurantifolia and Citrus paradisi showed almost equal diversity, whereas Citrus reticulata Blanco had a higher proportion of Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria in their leaves. To determine alpha diversity (AD), additional data was analyzed using statistical indices such as Shannon, Chao1, and Simpson. According to the inverse Simpson diversity index, the abundance of the microbial population in six different citrus samples was 0.48, 0.567, and 0.163, respectively. The metagenomics of microbiota in plant tissues was successfully recorded by NGS technology, which can help us learn more about the interactions between plants and microbes. This research is the first step toward a better understanding of 16SrRNA-based metagenomics from citrus in Pakistan using Illumina (Hi seq) Technology.","Objective The aim of this study was to investigate the association of food insecurity score with the status of Covid-19 infection.","Testosterone is a naturally occurring hormone that has been positively associated with lean mass and strength in males. Whether endogenous testosterone is related to lean mass and strength in females is unknown.","Background The novel corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been causing a massive global public health havoc. Use of quinolones for treatment of COVID-19 was a matter of huge discussion in scientific community. Falsified data about efficacy of the drug against COVID-19 disseminated. This review was designed to study the dosages of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine planned to be administered in clinical trials registered up to March 2020.","Background Private retail pharmacies in developing countries present a unique channel for COVID-19 prevention. We assessed the response to the COVID-19 pandemic by pharmacies in Kenya, aiming to identify strategies for maximising their contribution to the national response.","Background Based on systematic literature reviews, the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) Global Burden of Disease (GBD) landmark risk factor paper attributes about 8 million noncommunicable diseases deaths/year to a composite of 15 dietary risk factors. Another 27 million noncommunicable deaths out of 56.5 million total deaths worldwide are attributed to high levels of metabolic risk factors.","The development of new approaches that allow early assessment of which cases of COVID-19 will likely become critical and the discovery of new therapeutic targets are urgent demands. In this cohort study, we performed proteomic and laboratorial profiling of plasma from 163 patients admitted to Bauru State Hospital (Bauru, SP, Brazil) between May 4th and July 4th, 2020, who were diagnosed with COVID-19 by RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab samples. Plasma samples were collected upon admission for routine laboratory analyses and shotgun quantitative label-free proteomics. Based on the course of the disease, the patients were further divided into 3 groups: a) mild symptoms, discharged without admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) (n=76); b) severe symptoms, discharged after admission to an ICU (n=56); c) critical, died after admission to an ICU (n=31). White cells and neutrophils were significantly higher in severe and critical patients compared to mild ones. Lymphocytes were significantly lower in critical patients compared to mild ones and platelets were significantly lower in critical patients compared to mild and severe ones. Ferritin, TGO, urea and creatinine were significantly higher in critical patients compared to mild and severe ones. Albumin, CPK, LDH and D-dimer were significantly higher in severe and critical patients compared to mild ones. PCR was significantly higher in severe patients compared to mild ones. Proteomic analysis revealed marked changes between the groups in plasma proteins related to complement activation, blood coagulation, antimicrobial humoral response, acute inflammatory response, and endopeptidase inhibitor activity. Higher levels of IREB2, GELS, POLR3D, PON1 and ULBP6 upon admission to hospital were found in patients with mild symptoms, while higher levels of Gal-10 were found in critical and severe patients. This needs to be validated in further studies. If confirmed, pathways involving these proteins might be potential new therapeutic targets for COVID-19.","","The brain-gut axis is increasingly recognized as an important contributing factor in the onset and progression of severe mental illnesses such as schizophrenia spectrum disorders and bipolar disorder. This study investigates associations between levels of faecal metabolites identified using 1H-NMR, clinical parameters, and dietary components of forty-two individuals diagnosed in a transdiagnostic approach to have severe mental illness. Faecal levels of the amino acids; alanine, leucine, and valine showed a significant positive correlation with psychiatric symptom severity as well as with dairy intake. Overall, this study proposes a diet-induced link between the brain-gut axis and the severity of psychiatric symptoms, which could be valuable in the design of novel dietary or therapeutic interventions to improve psychiatric symptoms.","Background COVID-19 is a global health emergency. Recent data indicate a 50% mortality rate across UK intensive care units.","Background Organophosphates are widely used by human nowadays, but these compounds have tremendous negative effect on the man health. So this study aims to use of Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) to alleviates the negative effects of Dimethoate (DM).","Objective Cytokine storm and Coagulopathy have been implicated as major causes of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. A black yeast Aureobasidium pullulans AFO-202 strain produced beta 1,3-1,6 glucan has been reported to offer potential immune enhancement and metabolism balancing, as well as mitigation of coagulopathy risks. The N-163 strain produced beta glucan is an efficient anti-inflammatory immune modulator. In this pilot clinical study, we report the beneficial effects of these two beta glucans on the biomarkers for cytokine storm and coagulopathy in COVID-19 patients.","Thinking one is better than peers is generally associated with positive psychological outcomes like increased self-esteem and resilience. However, this tendency may be problematic in the context of collective action problems, wherein individuals are reliant on others\u2019 prosocial behaviors to achieve larger goals. We examined this question in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, and recruited participants (n = 1022) from a university community in Spring 2020. We found evidence for a self-peer asymmetry, such that participants reported that they were doing more to stop the spread of the disease and were more prosocially motivated than peers. Actual peer reports indicated that these were overestimations. This self-enhancement tendency comes with a cost: the perceived self-peer asymmetry mediated the relationship between Covid-specific worry and general anxiety during the early lockdown period. This indicates that while believing one is doing more than others may be maladaptive in collective action problems.","","","A total of 6,628 PUBMED-registered publications on the relationships between the effects of vaccination and the provision of micronutrients have been studied by methods of topological analysis of text data. In case of insufficient intake of certain micronutrients, the functioning of the acquired immunity is disrupted resulting in an imbalance of populations of T-cells CD4+/CD8+ and of B-lymphocytes. Nutritional supplements of folate, vitamins A, D and B12, which are recognized regulators of cell division, support a wide range of lymphocyte populations. Trace elements zinc, iron, selenium, manganese and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are also important for supporting the mechanisms of acquired immunity. The data presented show that a course intake of these micronutrients by patients planning vaccination can significantly improve its effectiveness. In particular, these micronutrients can increase the titers of antibodies to pathogens, and to reduce the percentage of patients who still contract infection after vaccination. Supplements of these micronutrients can also contribute to the safety of vaccination: to prevent malaise and, in the unfortunate case of contracting infection despite the vaccine, to reduce the severity of the course and the mortality from the corresponding infection.","Soil microorganisms drive ecosystem function, but challenges of scale between microbe and ecosystem hinder our ability to accurately quantify and predictively model the soil microbe-ecosystem function relationship. Quantifying this relationship necessitates studies that systematically characterize multi-omics of soil microorganisms and their activity across sampling scales from spatially resolved to bulk measures, and structural complexity, from liquid pure culture to in situ. To address this need, we cultured two diazotrophic bacteria in liquid and solid media, with and without nitrogen (N) to quantify differences in extracellular metabolites associated with nitrogen fixation under increasing environmental structural complexity. We also quantified extracellular metabolites across sampling scales including bulk sampling via GC-MS analysis and spatially resolved analysis via MALDI mass spectrometry imaging. We found extracellular production of inorganic and organic N during free-living nitrogen fixation activity, highlighting a key mechanism of terrestrial N contributions from this process. Additionally, our results emphasize the need to consider the structural complexity of the environment and spatial scale when quantifying microbial activity. We found differences in metabolite profiles between culture conditions, supporting previous work indicating environmental structure influences microbial function, and across scales, underscoring the need to quantify microbial scale conditions to accurately interpret microbial function.","Background Long COVID has been a social concern. Though patient characteristics associated with developing long COVID are partially known, those associated with persisting it have not been identified.","Objective To evaluate the efficacy and safety of PNB001 a CCK-A agonist and CCK-B antagonist, a new chemical entity with anti-inflammatory and immune stimulation properties, along with Standard of Care (SOC) in patients with moderate COVID-19 infection.","","Background AYUSH formulations have a potential role in symptomatic treatment, preventing disease progression and improving quality of life in COVID-19 patients.","Rationale In late December 2019, an outbreak of acute respiratory illness, now officially named as COVID-19, or coronavirus disease 2019, emerged in Wuhan, China, now spreading across the whole country and world. More data were needed to understand the clinical characteristics of the disease.","Objective To provide diagnostic evidence and clues for patients with fever of unknown origin (FUO) through urine proteomics analysis.","Background The existence of few biomarkers and the lack of a better understanding of the pathophysiology of levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) in Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) require new approaches, as the metabolomic analysis, for discoveries.","Objective This living systematic review aims to provide a timely, rigorous and continuously updated summary of the evidence available on the role of vitamin C in the treatment of patients with COVID-19.","","Background In the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, many hospitalized patients received empiric hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine (HC/CQ). Although some retrospective-observational trials suggested potential benefit, all subsequent randomized clinical trials (RCTs) failed to show benefit and use generally ceased. Herein, we summarize key studies that clinicians advising patients on HC/CQ\u2019s efficacy:safety calculus in hospitalized COVID-19 patients would want to know about in a practical one-stop-shopping source.","Background Global knowledge of treatment and outcomes of COVID-19 has been evolving since the onset of the pandemic.","Objectives To compare the co-administration of an Ayurvedic drug AYUSH 64 as an adjunct to standard of care (SOC) and SOC for efficacy and safety in the management of COVID-19.","","Background Obesity has been identified as an emerging health concern for Chinese American children; however, very little is known about diets in Asian American children.","Background While there was a lack of pharmacological interventions proven to be effective in early, outpatient settings for COVID-19, in a prospective, open-label observational study (pre-AndroCoV Trial) the use of nitazoxanide, ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine demonstrated similar effects, and apparent improvement of outcomes compared to untreated patients. The unexpected apparent positive results led to ethical questions on the employment of further full placebo-control studies in early stage COVID-19. The objective of the present study was to elucidate whether the conduction of a full placebo-control RCT was still ethically viable, through a comparative analysis with two control-groups.","Objectives To investigate how the relationship between vitamin D and COVID-19 has been presented in traditional media sources (UK newspapers) and assess the level of misinformation associated with this issue by comparing newspaper article content to the evidence-based guidelines.","Abstract Well-curated datasets are essential to evidence based decision making and to the integration of artificial intelligence with human reasoning across disciplines. However, many sources of data remain siloed, unstructured, and/or unavailable for complementary and secondary research. Sysrev was developed to address these issues. First, Sysrev was built to aid in systematic evidence reviews (SER), where digital documents are evaluated according to a well defined process, and where Sysrev provides an easy to access, publicly available and free platform for collaborating in SER projects. Secondly, Sysrev addresses the issue of unstructured, siloed, and inaccessible data in the context of generalized data extraction, where human and machine learning algorithms are combined to extract insights and evidence for better decision making across disciplines. Sysrev uses FAIR - Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse of digital assets - as primary principles in design. Sysrev was developed primarily because of an observed need to reduce redundancy, reduce inefficient use of human time and increase the impact of evidence based decision making. This publication is an introduction to Sysrev as a novel technology, with an overview of the features, motivations and use cases of the tool.","","Eloquent information about the genetic basis of inheritance is important for any breeding program. Therefore, a diallel study was conducted under the influence of tomato leaf curl virus (TLCV) disease, using the eleven advanced lines of tomato. Firstly, the information regarding percent disease index (PDI) was determined via artificial screening with viruliferous whiteflies. Later, these lines were crossed in half diallel mating design to produce fifty-five one-way hybrids. These hybrids and parental genotypes were evaluated for seven morphological and three biochemical traits under open field conditions. Using the Griffing approach (Method II and Model I) basis of inheritance of traits were determined. Also, a Bayesian model was applied to the total yield descriptor. Correlations data indicated that total yield was not correlated with any other trait. The significant general combining ability (GCA) and specific combining ability (SCA) values indicates exploitable genetic variation. The broad-sense heritability values were larger than narrow-sense heritability, showing that selection will be efficient for the improvement of these traits. Hybrid combinations H23, H42 and H49 can be considered efficient for the selection of multiple traits, including yield. Overall, this study provides a useful information regarding the genetics of important traits of tomato under TLCV infestation.","Background COVID-19 is a respiratory disease that results in a prothrombotic state manifesting as thrombotic, microthrombotic and thromboembolic events. As a result, several antithrombotic modalities have been implicated in the treatment of this disease. This study aimed to identify if therapeutic anticoagulation or concurrent use of antiplatelet and anticoagulants was associated with an improved outcome in this patient population.","Food environments can profoundly impact diet and related diseases. Effective, robust measures of food environment nutritional quality are required by researchers and policymakers investigating their effects on individual dietary behavior and designing targeted public health interventions. The most commonly used indicators of food environment nutritional quality are limited to measuring the binary presence or absence of entire categories of food outlet type, such as \u2018fast-food\u2019 outlets, which can range from burger joints to salad chains. This work introduces a summarizing indicator of restaurant nutritional quality that exists along a continuum, and which can be applied at scale to make distinctions between diverse restaurants within and across categories of food outlets. Verified nutrient data for a set of over 500 chain restaurants is used as ground-truth data to validate the approach. We illustrate the use of the validated indicator to characterize food environments at the scale of an entire jurisdiction, demonstrating how making distinctions between different shades of nutritiousness can help to uncover hidden patterns of disparities in access to high nutritional quality food.","Citrus come in diverse sizes and shapes, and play a key role in world culture and economy. Citrus oil glands in particular contain essential oils which include plant secondary metabolites associated with flavor and aroma. Capturing and analyzing nuanced information behind the citrus fruit shape and its oil gland distribution provides a morphology-driven path to further our insight into phenotype-genotype interactions.","Background Prevention of coronavirus (COVID-19) regarding households has many aspects, such as buying masks, hand sanitizer, face shield, and many others. As a result of buying the previous items, the household spending per month will be increase during the COVID-19 pandemic period.","Infection with SARS-CoV-2 has highly variable clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic infection through to life-threatening disease. Host whole blood transcriptomics can offer unique insights into the biological processes underpinning infection and disease, as well as severity. We performed whole blood RNA Sequencing of individuals with varying degrees of COVID-19 severity. We used differential expression analysis and pathway enrichment analysis to explore how the blood transcriptome differs between individuals with mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19, performing pairwise comparisons between groups. Increasing COVID-19 severity was characterised by an abundance of inflammatory immune response genes and pathways, including many related to neutrophils and macrophages, in addition to an upregulation of immunoglobulin genes. Our insights into COVID-19 severity reveal the role of immune dysregulation in the progression to severe disease and highlight the need for further research exploring the interplay between SARS-CoV-2 and the inflammatory immune response.","Background and purpose The objective of this systematic review is to summarize the effects of ivermectin for the prevention and treatment of patients with COVID-19 and to assess inconsistencies in results from individual studies with focus on risk of bias due to methodological limitations.","","Background Evidence recommends that vitamin D might be a crucial supportive agent for the immune system, mainly in cytokine response regulation against COVID-19. Hence, we carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis in order to maximize the use of everything that exists about the role of vitamin D in the COVID-19.","","Low red blood cell (RBC) membrane content of EPA and DHA, i.e., the omega-3 index (O3I), and elevated RBC distribution width (RDW) are risk factors for all-cause mortality. O3I and RDW are related with membrane fluidity and deformability. Our objective was to determine if there is a relationship between O3I and RDW in healthy adults. Subjects without inflammation or anemia, and with values for O3I, RDW, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), body mass index (BMI), age and sex were identified (n=25,485) from a clinical laboratory dataset of &gt;45,000 individuals. RDW was inversely associated with O3I in both sexes before and after (both p&lt;0.00001) adjusting models for sex, age, BMI and CRP. Stratification by sex revealed a sex-O3I interaction with the RDW-O3I slope (p&lt;0.00066) being especially steep in females with O3I \u22645.6%. In healthy adults of both sexes, the data suggested that an O3I of &gt;5.6% may help maintain normal RBC structural and functional integrity.","Objectives This study aimed to analyse the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of critical COVID-19 cases and investigate risk factors including comorbidities and age in relation with the clinical aftermath of COVID-19 in critical cases in Bangladesh.","","Despite the accumulating evidence that increased consumption of ultra-processed food has adverse health implications, it remains difficult to decide what constitutes processed food. Indeed, the current processing-based classification of food has limited coverage and does not differentiate between degrees of processing, hindering consumer choices and slowing research on the health implications of processed food. Here we introduce a machine learning algorithm that accurately predicts the degree of processing for any food, indicating that over 73% of the U.S. food supply is ultra-processed. We show that the increased reliance of an individual\u2019s diet on ultra-processed food correlates with higher risk of metabolic syndrome, diabetes, angina, elevated blood pressure and biological age, and reduces the bio-availability of vitamins. Finally, we find that replacing foods with less processed alternatives can significantly reduce the health implications of ultra-processed food, suggesting that access to information on the degree of processing, currently unavailable to consumers, could improve population health.","Little is known about how normal variation in dietary patterns in humans affects the aging process, largely because both nutrition and the physiology of aging are highly complex and multidimensional. Here, we apply the nutritional geometry framework to data from 1560 older adults followed over four years to assess how nutrient intake patterns affect the aging process. Aging was quantified via blood biomarkers integrated to measure loss of homeostasis. Additionally, we extend nutritional geometry to 19 micronutrients. Salient results include benefits of intermediate protein and vitamin E intake. Broadly, we show that there are few simple answers of \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d nutrients \u2013 optimal levels are generally intermediate, but dependent on other nutrients. Simpler linear/univariate analytical approaches are insufficient to capture such associations. We present an interactive tool to explore the results, and our approach presents a roadmap for future studies to explore the full complexity of the nutrition-aging landscape.","","Background The epidemiology of the Coronavirus-disease associated mucormycosis (CAM) syndemic is poorly elucidated. We aimed to identify risk factors that may explain the burden of cases and help develop preventive strategies.","Since the declaration of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, patients with migraine were specifically vulnerable to worsening of their headaches. Traditional medicine (TM) has been used to treat headache disorders for centuries, especially during times of a healthcare emergencies, similar to the current pandemic. We aimed to assess the use of TM in treatment of migraine amid COVID-19 pandemic in Kuwait, using an online, self-administered questionnaire. A total of 1018 patients completed the survey. TM was used by 39.9% respondents. The greatest users of TM were those with older age (p =0.04), and longer disease duration (p =0.005). TM users were found to be more compliant to treatments than non-TM users (p&lt;0.02). However, they reported significantly less communication with their physicians (p &lt;0.001) during the pandemic. This study showed higher rates of TM use, as a way of self-treatment, among patients with migraine during COVID-19 pandemic. Neurologists should prepare their patients with \u201crescue\u201d strategies for headache management, and new means of communication, to face these \u201cnew normal\u201d challenges.","In this study, we summarize the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 outbreak among Healthcare workers (HCWs) in a tertiary care hospital and compared various parameters and preventive measures taken by positive HCWs to a comparable cohort of COVID negative HCWs. 52.1% of COVID-19 positive HCWs showed symptoms of which only three needed hospitalization possibly due to a younger cohort of HCWs who got infected (35.9 \u00b1 9.3 years). Findings of present study found some protective role of full course prophylactic hydroxychloroquine as compared to a control group (p=0.021) and use of N95 masks over others (p&lt;0.001). Our results did not show any added protection with the use of prophylactic Vitamin C, D, Zinc, or betadine gargles. We also observed outbreak control with increased awareness, near universal testing, PPE provision, sanitization drive, and promoting social distancing among HCWs.","Introduction Covid-19 vaccines can cause adverse events (AE) that can lead to increased hesitation or fear of vaccination. This study aims at estimating the prevalence of severe adverse events (SAEs) and their associated factors among health professionals (HPs) vaccinated with COVISHIELD\u2122 vaccine in Togo.","Objective The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of spinal cord injury (SCI) on spike activity evoked in the hindlimb spinal cord of the rat from cortical electrical stimulation.","Computational Drug Repositioning aims at ranking and selecting existing drugs for use in novel diseases or existing diseases for which these drugs were not originally designed. Using vast amounts of available omic data in digital form within an in silico screening has the potential for speeding up considerably the shortlisting of promising candidates in response to outbreaks of diseases such as COVID-19 for which no satisfactory cure has yet been found. We describe DrugMerge as a methodology for preclinical computational drug repositioning based on merging multiple drug rankings obtained with an ensemble of Disease Active Subnetwork construction algorithms. DrugMerge uses differential transcriptomic data from cell lines/tissues of patients affected by the disease and differential transcriptomic data from drug perturbation assays, in the context of a large gene co-expression network. Experiments with four benchmark diseases (Asthma, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Prostate Cancer, and Colorectal Cancer) demonstrate that our method detects in first position drugs in clinical use for the specified disease, in all four cases. Our method is competitive with the state-of-the-art tools such as CMAP (Connectivity Map). Application of DrugMerge to COVID-19 data found rankings with many drugs currently in clinical trials for COVID-19 in top positions, thus showing that DrugMerge is able to mimic human expert judgment.","","Objectives To estimate the relationship between moderate alcohol consumption and brain health, determining the threshold intake for harm and identifying whether population subgroups are at differential risk.","Machine learning-based clinical decision support tools for sepsis create opportunities to identify at-risk patients and initiate treatments earlier, critical to improving sepsis outcomes. Increasing use of such systems necessitates quantifying and understanding provider adoption. Using real-time provider interactions with a sepsis early detection tool (Targeted Real-time Early Warning System) deployed at five hospitals over a two-year period (469,419 screened encounters, 9,805 (2.1%) retrospectively-identified sepsis cases), we found high sensitivity (82% of sepsis cases identified), high adoption rates (89% of alerts evaluated by a physician or advanced practice provider and 38% of evaluated alerts confirmed) and an association between use of the tool and earlier treatment of sepsis patients (1.85 (95% CI:1.66-2.00) hour reduction in median time to first antibiotics order). Further, we found that provider-related factors were strongly associated with adoption. Beyond improving system performance, efforts to improve adoption should focus on provider knowledge, experience, and perceptions of the system.","Background Bromhexine hydrochloride has been suggested as a TMPRSS2 protease blocker that precludes the penetration of SARS-CoV-2 into cells. We aimed to assess the preventive potential of regular bromhexine hydrochloride intake for COVID-19 risk reduction in medical staff actively involved in the evaluation and treatment of patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection.","The first COVID-19 case in Mexico was confirmed on 26 February 2020 and by May 3 the number of registered cases had risen to 30,927. However the rate of transmission varied greatly from city to city. We used data on temperature, humidity and ultraviolet radiation (UV) from 45 cities all over the country to explore whether there was an association between these variables and rates of transmission and rates of accumulation of COVID-19 ascribed deaths. The advantage of an in-country study of this kind is that many of the variables that can confound international studies are held constant (e.g. public health policies, methods of reporting, cultural, behavioural and genetic factors). Although the official statistics undoubtedly greatly underestimate the situation in Mexico due to lack of testing, they are underestimated in all cities so this should not introduce bias across the sample. We found that temperature and humidity had no discernible association with transmission rates but that UV during the transmission period was negatively correlated with rates of transmission, suggesting a sterilizing effect. UV in the January preceding the epidemic had a slightly higher association with transmission rates than UV during the transmission period itself. We also found negative associations of UV in the transmission period and in January with rate of cumulative deaths, but at lower levels of statistical significance. We conclude that in addition to a sterilizing effect during the transmission period, UV may have a physiological effect in reducing transmission and deaths due to COVID-19, most likely through the medium of vitamin D production in the body. This follows the growing body of medical evidence that vitamin D deficiency is associated with severity of COVID-19. However, we also found a negative correlation between altitude and rates of COVID-19 transmission, distinct and independent of the UV effect, which may indicate that other physiological processes are also present. In a multiple regression, altitude and UV together accounted for 18% of the variation in transmission rates between cities.","Objective To do a systematic review and critical appraisal of the ongoing clinical trials that are assessing various therapeutic interventions against SARS-CoV-2 with an aim to provide insight into the various interventions tested, clinical rationale, geographical distribution of the trials as well as the endpoints assessed in the studies.","Background Despite effective means to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection, the early treatment seeking behavior of those newly diagnosed with infection is not clear.","Context The \u2018antimicrobial resistant era\u2019 requires advances in the approaches and technologies to find new treatments. The enhancement of the antimicrobial activity of commercially available drugs (CADs) by natural products (NPs) has successful mixtures (e.g., clavulanic acid and amoxicillin).","","At least since March 2020, the multiorgan disease COVID-19 has a firm grip on the world. Although most of the cases are mild, patients from risk populations could develop a cytokine storm, which is characterized by a systemic inflammatory response leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome and organ failure. The present paper will introduce the small molecule MP1032, describe its mode of action, and give rationale why it is a promising option for prevention/treatment of SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine storm. MP1032 is a phase-pure anhydrous polymorph of 5-amino-2,3-dihydro-1,4-pthalazinedione sodium salt that exhibits good stability and bioavailability. The physiological action of MP1032 is based on a multi-target mechanism including localized, self-limiting antioxidant activities that were demonstrated in a model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced joint inflammation. Furthermore, immune-regulatory and PARP-1 modulating properties, coupled with antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 were shown in various cell models. Efficacy has been preclinically elucidated in LPS-induced endotoxemia, a model with excessively activated immune responses that shares many similarities to COVID-19. So far, during oral clinical development with three-months daily administrations, no serious adverse drug reactions occurred highlighting the outstanding safety profile of MP1032.","","Objectives To summarize the effects of intravenous corticosteroid treatment for sepsis defined by the Sepsis-3 criteria in adult patients.","The COVID-19 virus has infected millions of people and resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. By using the logistic regression model, we identified novel critical factors associated with COVID19 cases, death, and case fatality rates in 154 countries and in the 50 U.S. states. Among numerous factors associated with COVID-19 risk, we found that the unitary state system was counter-intuitively positively associated with increased COVID-19 cases and deaths. Blood type B was a protective factor for COVID-19 risk, while blood type A was a risk factor. The prevalence of HIV, influenza and pneumonia, and chronic lower respiratory diseases was associated with reduced COVID-19 risk. Obesity and the condition of unimproved water sources were associated with increased COVID-19 risk. Other factors included temperature, humidity, social distancing, smoking, and vitamin D intake. Our comprehensive identification of the factors affecting COVID-19 transmission and fatality may provide new insights into the COVID-19 pandemic and advise effective strategies for preventing and migrating COVID-19 spread.","Background Among middle-aged and elderly individuals, dietary habits have previously been reported to differ between patients with and without periodontal disease. However, in young adults, there are only a few reports that show a correlation between nutrient/food intake and periodontal disease. Moreover, no report has assessed the correlation between dietary habits measured by a self-administered diet history questionnaire (DHQ) and periodontal disease. Therefore, we assessed the correlation between dietary habits, determined using a DHQ, and periodontal disease in young adult women who are likely to develop a periodontal disease.","INTRODUCTION Due to the spread of SARS CoV-2 virus responsible for COVID-19 disease, there is an urgent need to analyse COVID-2019 epidemic perception in Poland. This study aims to investigate social perception of coronavirus in the Internet media during the epidemic. It is a signal report highlighting the main issues in public perception and medical commutation in real time.","Objective Diabetes is a known risk factor for mortality in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Our objective was to identify prevalence of hyperglycemia in COVID-19 patients with and without prior diabetes and quantify its association with COVID-19 disease course.","Purpose Exploring the effect of COVID-19 diagnosis on the individual has not been explored through an exploratory qualitative approach.

Very well-established evolutionary biology theory suggests that lifespan trades off against reproductive success, possibly sex-specifically. We examined whether a key driver of reproductive success, testosterone, affected lifespan using a Mendelian randomization study of longevity in the UK Biobank to obtain unbiased estimates, along with control exposures.","Background Water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services have the potential to interrupt transmission of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria and reduce the need for antibiotics, thereby reducing selection for resistance. However, evidence of WASH impacts on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is lacking.","Background Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination vary for reasons that remain poorly understood.","Background Anemia occurs because of insufficient hemoglobin, which provides oxygen to the body. Because of its close relationship with various illnesses, it must always be investigated clinically. Previous studies have demonstrated an association between hemoglobin concentration and handgrip strength. Thus, we aimed to analyze the association between handgrip strength and anemia in Korean adults to determine whether the handgrip strength test can be used as a tool to identify anemia.","Background The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 seemed to affect locations in the northern hemisphere most severely appearing to overlap with the pattern of seasonal vitamin D deficiency. Integrating available knowledge, we hypothesised that vitamin D status could play a causal role in COVID-19 outcomes.","","Objective In this study, we evaluated the efficiency of the combination of two variants\u2019 AFO-202 and N-163 strains of Aureobasidium Pullulans produced in comparison with the control arm, which underwent a conventional regimen of treatment alone, for a shorter duration of 15 days.","Background The second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to considerable morbidity and mortality in India, in part due to lack of healthcare access, low health literacy, and poor disease surveillance. In this retrospective, descriptive ecological study, we utilized Google Trends (GT) to characterize the second COVID-19 wave and its association with official case counts based on search terms related to symptoms, testing, disease complications, medications, preventive behaviors, and healthcare utilization.","Ulcerative colitis is a condition characterised by the infiltration of leukocytes into the gastrointestinal wall. Leukocyte-MPO catalyses hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and hypothiocyanous acid (HOSCN) formation from chloride (Cl-) and thiocyanous (SCN-) anions, respectively. While HOCl indiscriminately oxidises biomolecules, HOSCN primarily targets low-molecular weight protein thiols. Oxidative damage mediated by HOSCN may be reversible, potentially decreasing MPO-associated host tissue destruction. This study investigated the effect of SCN- supplementation in a model of acute colitis. Female mice were supplemented dextran sodium sulphate (DSS, 3% w/v) in the presence of 10 mM Cl- or SCN- in drinking water ad libitum, or with salts (NaCl and NaSCN only) or water only (controls). Behavioural studies showed mice tolerated NaSCN and NaCl-treated water with water-seeking frequency. Ion-exchange chromatography showed increased fecal and plasma SCN- levels in thiocyanate supplemented mice; plasma SCN- reached similar fold-increase for smokers. Overall there was no difference in weight loss and clinical score, mucin levels, crypt integrity and extent of cellular infiltration between DSS/SCN- and DSS/Cl- groups. Neutrophil recruitment remained unchanged in DSS-treated mice, as assessed by fecal calprotectin levels. Total thiol and tyrosine phosphatase activity remained unchanged between DSS/Cl- and DSS/SCN- groups, however, colonic tissue showed a trend in decreased 3-chlorotyrosine (1.5-fold reduction, p&lt;0.051) and marked increase in colonic GCLC, the rate-limiting enzyme in glutathione synthesis. These data suggest that SCN- administration can modulate MPO activity towards a HOSCN-specific pathway, however, this does not alter the development of colitis within a DSS murine model.","Background Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has developed into a full-blown global pandemic. It has been reported that patients with COVID-19 meeting the criteria for hospital discharge (including two consecutive negative RT-PCR results) have experienced recurrent PCR positivity. However, the clinical course and risk factors for these patients have not been well described.","Variables responsible for the differential COVID-19 pandemic severity among countries remain undefined. Zinc, a micronutrient required for immunocompetence, is found deficient in populations. We hypothesized the differential COVID-19 severity observed among European countries could be associated with the Zn-deficiency prevalence. The COVID-19 data from different stages of pandemic, i.e., 8 April, 12 and 26 May 2020, were analyzed for covariation with the estimated Zn-deficiency. A significant, relatively stable, but negative correlation of Zn-deficiency with cases per million for the time period [r(20): -0.4930 to -0.5335, p-value: 0.02720 to 0.0154] and a steady improvement of covariation with deaths per million [r(20): -0.4056; p-value: 0.0760 on 26 May 2020] was observed. Considering, Zinc\u2019s key immunomodulatory role, widespread deficiency along with the self- and prescribed intervention in different target groups, e.g. children, women, elderly, carefully planned dedicated exploratory studies to understand the basis of the observed association are advisable.","Background Ivermectin is one among several potential drugs explored for its therapeutic and preventive role in COVID-19 infection. The study was aimed to explore the association between ivermectin prophylaxis and development of COVID-19 infection among healthcare workers.","Background COVID-19 is a rapidly spreading disease that has caused extensive burden to individuals, families, countries, and the world. Effective treatments of COVID-19 are urgently needed. This is the second edition of a living systematic review of randomized clinical trials assessing the effects of all treatment interventions for participants in all age groups with COVID-19.","Purpose We have recently demonstrated that dietary nitrate, a source of nitric oxide via the enterosalivary pathway, can improve muscle contractile function in healthy older men and women. Nitrate ingestion has also been shown to reduce blood pressure in some, but not all, studies of older individuals. However, the optimal dose for eliciting these beneficial effects is unknown.","The COVID-19 pandemic originated in Wuhan, China on December 31st and spread into international borders, leading to a public health crisis and complete shutdown of countries. The strict quarantine measures taken by governments kept a large number of people, around the world, in isolation and affected many aspects of people\u2019s lives. These unprecedented changes triggered a wide variety of psychological problems ranging from panic disorders, anxiety and depression. In this study, we aim to explore anxiety levels among parents, teachers and the general community amid the COVID-19 pandemic in the UAE, as well as identify emotional and anxiety disorders in children. Using a web-based cross-sectional survey we collected data from 2,200 self-selected assessed volunteers. Demographic information, knowledge and beliefs about COVID-19, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) using the (GAD-7) scale, emotional problems in children using the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ), worry and fear about COVID-19, coping mechanisms and general health information were collected. The overall prevalence of GAD in the general population was 71% with younger people (59.8%) and females (51.7%) reporting the highest levels of anxiety. Parents who were teachers reported the highest percentage of emotional problems in children (26.7%) compared to parents only (14.6%) or teachers only (4.7%). Multivariate logistic regression for GAD-7 score showed that females, participants who felt public fear was justifiable, persons who worried about COVID-19, persons who intended to take the COVID-19 vaccine and smokers were all associated with anxiety. Multivariate logistic regression for SDQ showed parents who had severe anxiety levels were 7 times more likely to report more emotional problems in their children (OR=7.00, 95% CI, 3.45 to 14.0) than less anxious parents. Findings suggest the urgency of policy makers to develop effective screening and coping strategies for parents and teachers and more specifically for vulnerable children.","We combined clinical, cytokine, genomic, methylation and dietary data from 43 young adult monozygotic twin pairs (aged 22 \u2013 36, 53% female), where 25 of the twin pairs were substantially weight discordant (delta BMI &gt; 3kg/ m2). These measurements were originally taken as part of the TwinFat study, a substudy of The Finnish Twin Cohort study. These five large multivariate data sets (comprising 42, 71, 1587, 1605 and 63 variables, respectively) were jointly analysed using an integrative machine learning method called Group Factor Analysis (GFA) to offer new hypotheses into the multi-molecular-level interactions associated with the development of obesity. New potential links between cytokines and weight gain are identified, as well as associations between dietary, inflammatory and epigenetic factors. This encouraging case study aims to enthuse the research community to boldly attempt new machine learning approaches which have the potential to yield novel and unintuitive hypotheses. The source code of the GFA method is publically available as the R package GFA.","Currently, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has a worldwide epidemic, causing more than 80 million infections and more than 1.7 million deaths. The pandemic has led to the closure of enterprises and schools in many countries, resulting in serious disruption of the global economy and social activities. Remdesivir is currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of COVID-19, but the WHO declared that Remdesivir is almost ineffective against COVID-19. The research and development of vaccines has made great progress, but it will take at least several months for safe and effective vaccines to be widely used clinically. Clinical studies revealed that some Traditional Chinese Medicines, such as Lianhua Qingwen Capsule and Huoxiang Zhengqi Water, exhibited excellent therapeutic effect on COVID-19. However, until now, there is still no cure for COVID-19. Therefore, there is an urgent need to find medicines that can effectively fight against the SARS-CoV-2. In this study, JIE BEN No. 10 (JB10), a fermentation broth produced by Yi traditional medicine fermentation technology, was explored for its anti-coronavirus activity. The in vitro data showed that JB10 could significantly suppresses the replication of the SARS-CoV-2 with an EC50 of 769.1 times dilution and a selection index of 42.68. Further studies indicated that JB10 had significant anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. The analysis of active components suggested that JB10 contained a large amount of superoxide dismutase (SOD), flavones, polyphenols, crude polysaccharide, etc. which may explain the anti-coronavirus activity, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Our study provides a new potentially therapeutic strategy for COVID-19.","BACKGROUND No definitive treatment exists for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Honey and Nigella sativa (HNS) have established antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. Hence, we investigated efficacy of HNS against COVID-19. wide","Background Intake, either as dietary components or as supplements, and blood concentrations of vitamin E, C, lycopene and carotenoids have been associated with a lower risk of incident (ischemic) stroke. However, causality cannot not be inferred from these associations. Here, we investigated causality by analyzing the associations between genetically-influenced antioxidant levels in blood and ischemic stroke using Mendelian Randomization (MR).","Background It is to be determined whether people infected with SARS-CoV-2 will develop long-term immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and retain long-lasting protective antibodies after the infection is resolved. This study was to explore to explore the outcomes of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in four groups of individuals in Wuhan, China.","Wild relatives of tomato are a valuable source of natural variation in tomato breeding, as many can be hybridized to the cultivated species (Solanum lycopersicum). Several, including Solanum lycopersicoides, have been crossed to S. lycopersicum for the development of ordered introgression lines (ILs). Despite the utility of these wild relatives and their associated ILs, limited finished genomes have been produced to aid genetic and genomic studies. We have generated a chromosome-scale genome assembly for Solanum lycopersicoides LA2951 using PacBio sequencing, Illumina, and Hi-C. We identified 37,938 genes based on Illumina and Isoseq and compared gene function to the available cultivated tomato genome resources, in addition to mapping the boundaries of the S. lycopersicoides introgressions in a set of cv. VF36 x LA2951 introgression lines (IL). The genome sequence and IL map will support the development of S. lycopersicoides as a model for studying fruit nutrient/quality, pathogen resistance, and environmental stress tolerance traits that we have identified in the IL population and are known to exist in S. lycopersicoides.","Background To be universally applicable in treatment of severe COVID-19, novel therapies, especially those with little toxicity and low cost, are urgently needed. We report here the use of one such therapeutic combination involving two commonly used nutraceuticals, namely resveratrol and copper in patients with this disease. This study was prompted by pre-clinical reports that sepsis-related cytokine storm and fatality in mice can be prevented by oral administration of small quantities of resveratrol and copper. Since cytokine storm and sepsis are major causes of death in severe COVID-19, we retrospectively analyzed outcomes of patients with this condition who had received resveratrol and copper.","Much attention has focussed on conversion of human pluripotent stem cells (PSC) to a more naive developmental status. Here we provide a method for resetting via transient histone deacetylase inhibition. The protocol is effective across multiple PSC lines and can proceed without karyotype change. Reset cells can be expanded without feeders with a doubling time of around 24 hours. WNT inhibition stabilises the resetting process. The transcriptome of reset cells diverges markedly from primed PSC and shares features with human inner cell mass (ICM). Reset cells activate expression of primate-specific transposable elements. DNA methylation is globally reduced to the level in the ICM but is non-random, with gain of methylation at specific loci. Methylation imprints are mostly lost, however. Reset cells can be re-primed to undergo tri-lineage differentiation and germline specification. In female reset cells, appearance of bi-allelic X-linked gene transcription indicates re-activation of the silenced X chromosome. On re-conversion to primed status, XIST-induced silencing restores monoallelic gene expression. The facile and robust conversion routine with accompanying data resources will enable widespread utilisation, interrogation, and refinement of candidate na\u00efve cells.","Background Neural tube defects (NTDs) remain among the most common congenital anomalies. Contributing risk factors include genetics and nutrient deficiencies, however, a comprehensive assessment of nutrient-gene interactions in NTDs is lacking. We hypothesised that multiple nutrient-gene interactions would be evident in NTD-associated gene signatures.","Prolyl 4-hydroxylases (P4Hs) catalyze post-translational hydroxylation of peptidyl proline residues. In addition to collagen P4Hs and hypoxia-inducible factor P4Hs, a poorly characterized endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized transmembrane prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4H-TM) is found in animals. P4H-TM variants are associated with the familiar neurological HIDEA syndrome. Here, the 3D structure of the soluble human P4H-TM was solved using X-ray crystallography. The structure revealed an EF-domain with two Ca2+-binding motifs inserted to the catalytic domain. A substrate-binding cavity was formed between the EF-domain and the catalytic domain. The active site contained bound Fe2+ and N-oxalylglycine. Comparison to homologous structures complexed with peptide substrates showed that the substrate interacting residues and the lid structure that folds over the substrate are conserved in P4H-TM. Differences to homologs were found in the extensive loop structures that surround the substrate-binding cavity and generate a negative surface charge. Ca2+-binding affinity of P4H-TM was determined to be within the range of physiological Ca2+ concentration in the ER. The proximity of the EF-domain to the active site suggests that Ca2+-binding is relevant to the catalytic activity. P4H-TM was found both as a monomer and a dimer in solution, but the monomer-dimer equilibrium was not regulated by Ca2+. The solved 3D structure suggests that the HIDEA variants cause loss of P4H-TM function. In conclusion, P4H-TM shares key structural elements with the known P4Hs while possessing a unique property among the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases having an EF-domain and a catalytic activity potentially regulated by Ca2+.","Background The MIND diet has been linked with prevention of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and cognitive decline but has not been fully assessed in the context of Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD).","Predictability is a fundamental requirement in biological engineering. As we move to building coordinated multicellular systems, the potential for such systems to display chaotic behaviour becomes a concern. Therefore understanding which systems show chaos is an important design consideration. We developed a methodology to explore the potential for chaotic dynamics in small microbial communities governed by resource competition, intercellular communication and competitive bacteriocin interactions. We show that we can expect to find chaotic states in relatively small synthetic microbial systems, understand the governing dynamics and provide insights into how to control such systems. This work is the first to query the existence of chaotic behaviour in synthetic microbial communities and has important ramifications for the fields of biotechnology, bioprocessing and synthetic biology.","Shigella spp. are the causative agents of bacillary dysentery or shigellosis, mainly in children living in developing countries. The study of Shigella entire life cycle in vivo and the evaluation of vaccine candidates\u2019 protection efficacy have been hampered by the lack of a suitable animal model of infection (1). None of the ones evaluated so far (mouse, rabbit, guinea pig) allows to recapitulate shigellosis symptoms upon Shigella oral challenge. Historical reports suggest that dysentery and scurvy are both metabolic diseases associated with ascorbate-deficiency. Mammals which are susceptible to Shigella infection (humans, non-human primates and guinea pigs) are the lonely ones which are unable to synthesize ascorbate. We optimized a low-ascorbate diet to induce moderate ascorbate-deficiency but not scurvy in guinea pigs (Ascplasma conc.=1.6 \u03bcM vs 36 \u03bcM with optimal ascorbate supply). We demonstrated that moderate ascorbate-deficiency increases shigellosis severity during extended period of time (up to 48h) with all strains tested (Shigella flexneri 5a and 2a, Shigella sonnei). At late time-points, a massive influx of neutrophils was observed both within the disrupted colonic mucosa and in the luminal compartment, although Shigella remains able to disseminate deep into the organ to reach the sub-mucosal layer and the bloodstream. This new model of shigellosis opens new doors for the study both of Shigella infection strategy and innate and adaptive immune responses to Shigella infection. It may be also of a great interest to study the virulence of other pathogen for which no suitable animal model of infection is available (Vibrio cholerae, Yersinia pestis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis or Campylobacter jejuni, among others).","The offering of grocery stores is a strong driver of consumer decisions, shaping their diet and long-term health. While processed food has been increasingly associated with unhealthy diet, information on the degree of processing characterising an item in a store is virtually impossible to obtain, limiting the ability of individuals to make informed choices. Here we introduce GroceryDB, a database with over 50,000 food items sold by Walmart, Target, and Wholefoods, unveiling the degree of processing characterizing each food. GroceryDB indicates that 73% of the US food supply is ultra-processed, and on average ultra-processed foods are 52% cheaper than minimally-processed alternatives. We find that the nutritional choices of the consumers, translated as the degree of food processing, strongly depend on the food categories and grocery stores. We show that there is no single nutrient or ingredient \u201cbio-marker\u201d for ultra-processed food, allowing us to quantify the individual contribution of over 1,000 ingredients to ultra-processing. GroceryDB and the associated http://TrueFood.Tech/ website make this information available, aiming to simultaneously empower the consumers to make healthy food choices, and aid policy makers to reform the food supply.","Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is characterised by descending skeletal muscle weakness and wasting. FSHD is caused by mis-expression of the transcription factor DUX4, which is linked to oxidative stress, a condition especially detrimental to skeletal muscle with its high metabolic activity and energy demands. Oxidative damage characterises FSHD and recent work suggests metabolic dysfunction and perturbed hypoxia signalling as novel pathomechanisms. However, redox biology of FSHD remains poorly understood, and integrating the complex dynamics of DUX4-induced metabolic changes is lacking.","Tropical fish are fast-growing and high energetic-demand organisms, which can be highly vulnerable to long-lasting effects of heat stress and pollution, particularly under food shortages. We tested this by assessing highly complex direct and delayed interactive effects of an extreme temperature (32\u00b0C) from a simulated marine heatwave (MHW), copper (Cu, 0, 100, 150 and 175 \u00b5g L-1) and food availability (limited and saturated food) on larvae of a tropical, reef-associated seaperch (Psammoperca waigiensis). Cu, MHW, and food limitation independently reduced survival and growth, partly explained by reduced feeding. The negative effect of Cu on fish survival was more substantial under MHW, particularly under limited food. Delayed interactive effects of Cu, MHW, and food limitation were still lethal to fish larvae during the post-exposure period. These results indicate that reef-associated fish larvae are highly vulnerable to these dominant stressors, impairing their ecological function as predators in the coral reefs.","Context Natural antioxidants are vital to promote health and treat critical diseased conditions in the modern healthcare system.","","Background Symptoms after COVID-19 infection affect the quality of life of its survivor especially to the special senses including olfactory function. It is important to prevent the disability at an earlier stage. Vaccination as key prevention has been proven to be effective in reducing symptomatic disease and severity. However, the effects of vaccination on post COVID symptoms have not been evaluated. This study aimed to evaluate the possible protection of full vaccination and the occurrence of post-COVID olfactory dysfunction, specifically anosmia and hyposmia in patients who were diagnosed with COVID19.","Metabolic aberrations are a prominent feature of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD). Different neuronal subtypes have selective vulnerability in AD. Despite the recent advance of single cell and single nucleus RNA-seq of AD brains, genome-scale metabolic network changes in neuronal subtypes have not been systematically studied with detail. To bridge this knowledge gap, I developed a computational method called perturb-Met that can uncover transcriptional dysregulation centered at hundreds of metabolites in a metabolic network. perturb-Met successfully recapitulated known glycolysis, cholesterol, and other metabolic defects in APOE4-neurons and microglia, many of which are missed by current methods. Applying perturb-Met on AD snRNA-seq data, I revealed that the four neuronal subtypes in the entorhinal cortex shows subtype-specific metabolic changes, namely mitochondrial complex I metabolism, ganglioside metabolism, galactose and heparan sulfate metabolism, as well as glucose and lipid metabolism, respectively. perturb-Met also revealed significant changes in protein glycosylation in the neuron subtype specifically found in AD brains. These subtype-specific metabolic changes may potentially underlie their selective vulnerability in AD. perturb-Met is a valuable tool to discover potential metabolic network changes in many other single cell or bulk transcriptomic studies.","Introduction Emerging infectious diseases, especially the coronavirus disease identified in 2019 (COVID-19), can be complicated by a severe exacerbation in the Th17 cell-mediated IL-17 proinflammatory immune storm. This enhanced immune response plays a major role in mortality and morbidity, including neurological symptoms. We hypothesized that countering the cytokine storm with thiamine may have therapeutic efficacy in lowering the Th17 cell proinflammatory response. We used an in vitro study and corroborated those results in disease controls (DC). We developed an effective dose range and model for key pharmacokinetic measures with the potential of targeting the cytokine storm and neurological symptoms of COVID-19.","Background The associations between vegetable intake and metabolic risk factors remain inconsistent. This study was aimed to investigate the association between cooked and raw vegetable intake with serum lipids, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure and glycemic traits.","Objectives We examined the influence of the ex vivo combination therapy of metformin (Met, 1,1-dimethylbiguanide hydrochloride) with sodium selenite (Ss, Na2SeO3) on the changes in the production of nitric oxide (NO) and selected cytokines by circulating monocytes (MOs) during T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL).","Background Nepal is currently under lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic with misinformation circulating on social media. This study aimed to analyse the knowledge and awareness of COVID-19 amongst eye care professionals in Nepal.","Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) occurs after exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). For persons who are at high risk of exposure, the standard of care is personal protection from getting infected. Whether Ayurvedic rasayana drug like Chyawanprash can prevent symptomatic infection in frontline health care workers is unknown.","Objectives This study explores the clinical profiles and factors associated with COVID-19 in Cameroon.","Echinacea purpurea was shown to broadly inhibit coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. This review discusses the available clinical evidence from randomized, blinded and controlled human studies. Two RCTs with results on enveloped viruses, respectively coronavirus infections during prevention treatment were detected. Incidence and/or viral loads were measured by RT-PCR and symptom severity was recorded. Jawad et al. (2012) collected nasopharyngeal swabs from adults (N=755) over 4 months of continuous prevention. Overall, 24 and 47 enveloped virus infections occurred, including 21 and 33 coronavirus detections [229E; HKU1; OC43] with Echinaforce\u00ae extract [2\u2019400mg daily] and placebo, respectively (p=0.0114). Ogal et al. (2021) administered the same extract [1\u2019200mg] or control for 4 months to children (4 \u2013 12 years) (N=203). Echinacea reduced the incidence of enveloped virus infections from 47 to 29 (p=0.0038) whereas 11 and 13 coronavirus detections [229E, OC43, NL63] were counted (p&gt;0.05). Respiratory symptoms during coronavirus infections were significantly lower with area-under-curve AUC=75.8 (+/-50.24) versus 27.1 (+/-21.27) score points (p=0.0036). Importantly, viral loads in nasal secretions were significantly reduced by 98.5%, with Ct-values 31.1 [95% CI 26.3; 35.9] versus 25.0 [95% CI 20.5; 29.5] (p = 0.0479). Results from clinical studies confirm the antiviral activity found for Echinacea in vitro, embracing enveloped respiratory pathogens and therefore coronaviruses as well. Substantiating results from a new completed study seems to extrapolate these effects to the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. As hypothesized, the testified broad antiviral activity of Echinacea extract appears to be inclusive for SARS-CoV-2.","Motivation Many calculations in computational biology necessitate a use of a probabilistic optimisation protocol to determine a set of parameters that capture the system at a desired state in the configurational space. Here, we developed a flexible optimisation engine in R that can be plugged to any, simple or complex, modelling initiative through a few lucid interfacing functions, to perform a seamless optimisation with rigorous parameter sampling.","Background The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic has produced a large number of clinical trial reports with unprecedented rapidity, raising concerns about methodological quality and potential for research waste.","","The earliest predictors of future autoimmune diseases are a series of autoantibodies that are rarely evaluated and very within and between diseases. In addition, autoantibodies often appear just prior to disease onset. All of these factors make it difficult to apply interventions that might prevent disease. Earlier predictors of disease are needed. Here, a general population cohort was used to assess whether gut bacterial biomarkers could be identified prior to disease. Gut microbiome analysis on 1741 one-year old Swedish children was performed on samples collected in the late 1990s. These children were then followed for 18 years for the incidence of five autoimmune diseases and autism. Specific bacterial strains in the gut microbiome of one-year-old children have been identified as exclusive to the 96 subjects (cases) who acquired type 1 diabetes, celiac disease, hypothyroidism, Crohn\u2019s disease, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, or autism over their next 18 years. None of these strains were found in the 1645 children (controls) who did not acquire any of these diseases. Ten other strains were exclusive to those who remained disease-free. In most cases, the presence or absence of these bacteria were strongly associated with: 1) high-risk class II human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles; 2) dietary factors; or 3) a combination of HLA genetics and diet. These results have three significant implications: 1) certain class II HLA haplotypes may serve as bacterial gatekeepers early in life, altering microbiome composition thereby creating the potential for dysbiosis and inflammation; 2) the gut microbiome dysbiosis and inflammation during infancy, largely derived from host HLA genetics and diet, may be a common precedent to all five autoimmune diseases and autism; and 3) HLA gatekeeping may prevent gut colonization of beneficial bacteria in those genetically at-risk individuals who could most benefit from probiotic therapy.","Microvessels are essential for tissue engineering and regeneration. In current methods, endothelial cells are usually cultured in commercially available media and form a monolayer of cell sheets on stiff substrates and a tubular structure when cultured with soft hydrogels. To mimic the microvessels in vivo, researchers usually coculture the endothelial cells and pericytes from different adult tissues or derived from pluripotent stem cells in a three-dimensional hydrogel. However, there is a challenge for these models to reflect tissue-specific characteristics due to the vascular heterogeneity throughout the body. Here, we established a culture model for expanding adult tubular microvessels on stiff substrates with endothelial cells and pericytes derived from the same tissue. We isolated microvessels from adult rat subcutaneous soft connective tissue and cultured them on regular plastic dishes. We performed a series of screenings and formulated a custom-made medium (Medium-X), containing mainly antioxidants and three small molecules, Chir99021, A83-01, and Y27632. Medium-X significantly promoted adult microvessel growth while maintaining their characteristic tubular morphology up to 8 weeks in vitro, contrary to the monolayer of endothelial cell sheets in the commercially available medium EGM2MV. Transcriptomic analysis showed that Medium-X maintained the tubular morphology of microvessels by promoting angiogenesis and vascular remodeling while suppressing oxidation and lipid metabolic pathways. The model presented in this study can be applied to other organs for expanding organ-specific microvessels for tissue engineering and vascular regeneration.","","BACKGROUND Three companion randomized pragmatic trials were recently published assessing the effect of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) on pre- exposure prophylaxis (PrEP - \u201cRajasingham,\u201d NCT04328467), post- exposure prophylaxis (PEP - \u201cBoulware,\u201d NCT04308668) and treatment of early COVID-19 (\u201cSkipper,\u201d NCT04308668). Respectively, they found non-statistically significant reductions in development or persistence of COVID of 17%, 27% and 20% and concluded that HCQ did not reduce, prevent or substantially treat COVID-19 illness.","","  Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused global disruption and a\nsignificant loss of life. Existing treatments that can be repurposed as\nprophylactic and therapeutic agents could reduce the pandemic's devastation.\nEmerging evidence of potential applications in other therapeutic contexts has\nled to the investigation of dietary supplements and nutraceuticals for\nCOVID-19. Such products include vitamin C, vitamin D, omega 3 polyunsaturated\nfatty acids, probiotics, and zinc, all of which are currently under clinical\ninvestigation. In this review, we critically appraise the evidence surrounding\ndietary supplements and nutraceuticals for the prophylaxis and treatment of\nCOVID-19. Overall, further study is required before evidence-based\nrecommendations can be formulated, but nutritional status plays a significant\nrole in patient outcomes, and these products could help alleviate deficiencies.\nFor example, evidence indicates that vitamin D deficiency may be associated\nwith greater incidence of infection and severity of COVID-19, suggesting that\nvitamin D supplementation may hold prophylactic or therapeutic value. A growing\nnumber of scientific organizations are now considering recommending vitamin D\nsupplementation to those at high risk of COVID-19. Because research in vitamin\nD and other nutraceuticals and supplements is preliminary, here we evaluate the\nextent to which these nutraceutical and dietary supplements hold potential in\nthe COVID-19 crisis.\n","Background and objectives In an effort to improve donor health, we set out to investigate determinants other than blood donation that increase risk of ID in a healthy population and if they should be implemented into current blood donor selection processes.","Objective To evaluate the quality of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published on Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) and to investigate the reasons behind compromising the quality, if found.","","","Introduction Covid-19 is a triphasic disorder first typified by a viral phase that lasts from the first onset of symptoms until seven days later. This is followed by a second and third phase, initially characterized by the appearance of lung infiltrates, followed in 20% by respiratory failure. The second phase is usually heralded by an elevation of serologic inflammatory markers including CRP, ferritin, IL-6, LDH as well as D-dimers. Approximately 20% proceed to the second phase and are usually then treated with dexamethasone, provided they are oxygen-dependent since these are the only cases that benefit from dexamethasone. If we had objective criteria to predict this 20% that develop severe illness, they could preemptively be treated with steroids. In this exploratory study we investigated the early use of preemptive steroids in the setting of early disease, in high-risk non-oxygen dependent cases.","Widespread and sustained engagement with health-protective behaviours (i.e., hygiene and distancing) is critical to successfully managing the COVID-19 pandemic. Evidence from previous emerging infectious disease outbreaks points to the role of perceived risk, worry, media coverage, and knowledge in shaping engagement with health-protective behaviours as well as vaccination intentions. The current study examined these factors in 2,174 Australian residents. An online survey was completed between 2-9 March 2020, at an early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak in Australia. Results revealed that two thirds of respondents were at least moderately worried about a widespread COVID-19 outbreak in Australia (which subsequently occurred). Worry about the outbreak and closely following media coverage were consistent predictors of health-protective behaviours (both over the previous month, and intended behaviours in the case of a widespread outbreak) as well as vaccination intentions. Health-behaviour engagement over the previous month was lower in some demographic groups, including males and younger individuals (18-29 age group). These was a substantial mismatch between respondents\u2019 expected symptoms of infection and emerging evidence that a meaningful proportion of people who contract the novel coronavirus will experience asymptomatic infection (i.e., they will not experience symptoms associated with COVID-19). Only 0.3% of those in the current study believed that they personally would not experience any symptoms if they were infected. Uncertainty and misconceptions about COVID-19 were common, including one third of respondents who reported being unsure whether people are likely have natural or existing immunity. There was also uncertainty around whether specific home remedies (e.g., vitamins, saline rinses) would offer protection, whether the virus could spread via the airborne route, and whether the virus was human made and deliberately released. Such misconceptions are likely to cause concern for members of the public. These results point to areas of uncertainty that could be usefully targeted by public education campaigns, as well as psychological and demographic factors associated with engagement with health-protective behaviours. These findings offer potential pathways for interventions to encourage health-protective behaviours to reduce the spread of COVID-19.","BACKGROUND As of January 1, 2021, there have been 81,947,503 confirmed cases of COVID-19, resulting in 1,808,041 deaths worldwide. Several vaccines are now available for emergency use, but it will take many months to immunize the world\u2019s population. There is a pressing need for outpatient treatment now. We reviewed the possible options","Background SARS-CoV-2 infection has severely ravaged health systems, economic and social progress globally in 2020. Seroprevalence studies can provide relevant information on the target populations for vaccination. They are relevant not only in the community, but also for critical population subgroups such as nursing homes or health care facilities. They will assist in strategizing the vaccination policy especially since there is limited availability of the vaccine and vaccine hesitancy","Objective The COVID-19 pandemic was accompanied by varying movement restriction measures across populations worldwide. These restrictions altered daily activities at all levels, including food access and intake, as well as psychological feelings during lockdown. The main objective of the present study was to evaluate health, and nutrition behaviors during confinement during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Introduction High-dose vitamin C (hdVC) is regarded as one of the essential adjunctive drugs for sepsis treatment. The present study aimed to deduce if hdVC could lead to erroneous testing results from the point-of-care glucose (POCG) measurement.","COVI-19 is a variant of coronavirus diseases that has destabilised the entire world and whose cure as at mid-2020 has become elusive. Social media is ablaze with discussions around the pandemic. There is the dire need to delineate the on-going conversations on the infection with the intention of creating awareness on people\u2019s reaction, opinion, action and recommendation that are inimical to the wellbeing of the populace. Hence, this study is geared towards performing thematic analysis of the discussions on social media about COVID-19. We programmatically retrieved data from twitter between 1st March, 2020 to 30th June 2020 with covid-19 related keywords. We processed the data and later categorised them into themes that evolved from the tweets namely Herbs and Vegetables as COVID-10 Panacea, Self-Medication Due to Prescription by Non-Medical Practitioners on Social Media, Conspiracy Theories on COVID-19 and Fear and Anxiety Associated with COVID-19. The results show that many are resulting to herbs to protect themselves against the disease; taking drugs without doctor\u2019s prescription; believing in conspiracy theories and having certain degree of fear.","Objectives A plethora of medicines have been repurposed or used as adjunctive therapies for COVID-19. We characterized the utilization of medicines as prescribed in routine practice amongst patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in South Korea, China, Spain, and the USA.","Background Despite the observed associations between psychiatric disorders and nutrient intake, genetic studies are limited.","The lack of treatment options for COVID-19 has raised many concerns among populations worldwide, which has led to many attempts to find alternative options to prevent the transmission of the disease or to alleviate the progression of the infection, including focusing more on preventive measures (to prevent transmission to other individuals) and the use of natural products and herbal extracts to increase immunity and decrease the probability of getting infected. This study explored the knowledge of the population of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) about COVID-19 preventive measures and their belief about the consumption of herbal products for the prevention of COVID-19 infection. A total of 5,258 individuals participated in this study. Participants\u2019 knowledge about the appropriate COVID-19 preventive measures in terms of handwashing procedures, self-quarantine and social distancing was moderate, with a mean score of 5.5 (SD: 1.7) out of 10 (representing around 55.0% of the total score). About 22.1% (n= 1,161) of the participants reported that they have used herbal products or nutritional supplements during the pandemic period, to protect themselves from the disease. Social media and the Internet (39.4%, n= 372) were the main motivators for the participants to try herbal products. Vitamin C was the most commonly used food supplement to increase immunity and reduces the chance of contracting COVID-19. Our study demonstrated that the general population in Saudi Arabia has a moderate level of knowledge about COVID-19 transmission and preventive measures. A considerable proportion of the population reported the use of herbal products or food supplements in order to protect themselves from the disease. Policymakers are suggested to provide further educational campaigns that increase population knowledge about the disease transmission routes and preventive measures. In addition, the use of herbal products should be evidence-based to ensure patient safety.","","Background Globally, the novel coronavirus, is a public health problem causing respiratory infections. Since the outbreak of severe acute and Middle East respiratory syndromes coronavirus was not reported to cause human infections. Now, it become an epidemic proportion with growing number of cases and deaths.","","Iodine has strong antimicrobial properties and has been used in topical applications as antiseptic. Its systemic use in form of iodine complexes derived from dried seaweed extract is beneficial in treating various disorders. Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) chronic infection is present in 6-10% of the Pakistani population and is a major healthcare burden that could benefit from innovative therapeutic regimens.","Introduction The aim of this paper was to assess Australian primary healthcare providers\u2019 perspectives and knowledge about dementia risk factors and risk reduction.","Ivermectin is a safe, inexpensive and effective early COVID-19 treatment validated in 20+ RCTs. Having developed combination therapies for Helicobacter pylori, we tested various COVID-19 combinations and describe the most effective. In 24 consecutive COVID-19 subjects with high risk features, hypoxia and untreated moderate-severe symptoms averaging 9 days, we trialed this novel combination comprising ivermectin, doxycycline, zinc, and Vitamins D and C. It was highly effective. All subjects resolved symptoms in 11 days on average, and oxygen saturation improved in 24hrs (87.4% to 93.1%, p=0.001). Hospitalizations and deaths were significantly fewer (p&lt;0.002 or 0.05, respectively) than in background-matched controls from the CDC database. Triple combination therapy is safe and effective even in moderate-severe patients with hypoxia treated in the outpatient setting.","Background Nutritional deficiencies have many immediate and long-term effects on physical and cognitive development outcomes, with the children not achieving their full potential. A milk-based health drink fortified with micronutrients as a part of a daily balanced diet can promote physical and cognitive growth in children by increasing macronutrients and micronutrients availability in the body. The systematic analysis aims to quantify the effect of a formulated health drink on children\u2019s physical, clinical, and cognitive development outcomes.","Background COVID-19 pandemic has ignited the urge for repurposing old drugs as candidate antiviral medicines to treat novel challenges of viral infections. Niclosamide (NCS) is an anti-parasitic drug of known antiviral potential. Therefore, this study attempts to investigate the antiviral effect and safety of NCS on SARS-CoV-2 caused COVID-19 patients.","","","Background COVID-19 patients suffer from hypercoagulation and activated immune-inflammatory pathways. This study was performed to assay serum complement C3 and C4, and thromboxane A2 (TxA2) and prostacyclin (PGI2) in association with chest CT scan anomalies (CCTAs) and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2)","Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD) is one of the largest health crises in the world. There are, however, limited but expensive pharmaceutical interventions to treat AD and most of the treatment options are not for cure or prevention, but to slow down the progression of the disease. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of tactile stimulation on AD-like symptoms and pathology in APP NL-G-F/NL-G-F mice, a mouse model of AD. The results show that tactile stimulation improves the AD-like symptoms on tests of cognition, motor, and anxiety-like behaviours and these improvements are associated with reduced AD pathology in APP mice.","We revealed critical vulnerabilities of nutrient content claims under FDA per serving size (serving), CAC per 100 g or mL, CAC per serving, and CAC per 100 kcal and developed the proposed method to remove all vulnerabilities. We calculated the nutrient content of foods based on nutrient content claims under the proposed method. Then, we determined nutrient content claims for foods and food groups, and specified similarities between nutrient content claims in food groups. Also, we ranked foods and food groups based on met claims of the nutrient content. Nutrient content claims based on the proposed method, including free, very low, low, source, and high claims were determined in 8596 food items, 29 nutrients, and 25 food groups of the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, release 28. Source and high claims are used for positive nutrients (including vitamins, minerals except sodium, protein, and dietary fiber). The very low claim is used for sodium, and free and low claims are used for cholesterol, energy, saturated fat, sodium, and total fat (also known as negative nutrients). In general, critical vulnerabilities of nutrient content claims under FDA and CAC can cause: (1) excessive energy intake based on FDA and CAC per serving and CAC per 100 g or mL; (2) exceeding the DV (NRV) for low nutrients under FDA per serving and CAC per 100 g or mL by consuming small amounts of foods per day; (3) the presence of nutrient free, but not low nutrient, foods based on FDA per serving and CAC per 100 g or mL; (4) the calculation of nutrient content in inappropriate amounts of foods based on FDA per serving, CAC per 100 g or mL, CAC per 100 kcal, and CAC per serving; and (5) determination of energy from total fat and saturated fat for relevant claims in inappropriate portions based on FDA per serving and CAC per 100 g or mL. Breakfast cereals, baby foods, pork products, lamb, veal, and game products, poultry products, and beef products had the highest average of scores for source and high nutrients. Restaurant foods, fast foods, and sausages and luncheon meats had the lowest average of scores for free, very low, and low nutrients. Nutrient source or high nutrient foods for all 24 positive nutrients were found in seven food groups (American Indian/Alaska Native foods; baby foods; beverages; dairy and egg products; legumes and legume products; meals, entrees, and side dishes; vegetables and vegetable products). There were very few source and high foods for potassium and vitamin D. Also, there were very few energy free foods.","SARS-CoV-2 started spreading towards the end of 2019 causing COVID-19, a disease that reached pandemic proportions among the human population within months. The reasons for the spectrum of differences in the severity of the disease across the population, and in particular why the disease affects more severely the aging population and those with specific preconditions are unclear. We developed machine learning models to mine 240,000 scientific papers openly accessible in the CORD-19 database, and constructed knowledge graphs to synthesize the extracted information and navigate the collective knowledge in an attempt to search for a potential common underlying reason for disease severity. The literature repeatedly pointed to elevated blood glucose as a key facilitator in the progression of COVID-19. Indeed, when we retraced the steps of the SARS-CoV-2 infection we found evidence linking elevated glucose to each step of the life-cycle of the virus, progression of the disease, and presentation of symptoms. Specifically, elevations of glucose provide ideal conditions for the virus to evade and weaken the first level of the immune defense system in the lungs, gain access to deep alveolar cells, bind to the ACE2 receptor and enter the pulmonary cells, accelerate replication of the virus within cells increasing cell death and inducing an pulmonary inflammatory response, which overwhelms an already weakened innate immune system to trigger an avalanche of systemic infections, inflammation and cell damage, a cytokine storm and thrombotic events. We tested the feasibility of the hypothesis by analyzing data across papers, reconstructing atomistically the virus at the surface of the pulmonary airways, and performing quantitative computational modeling of the effects of glucose levels on the infection process. We conclude that elevation in glucose levels can facilitate the progression of the disease through multiple mechanisms and can explain much of the variance in disease severity seen across the population. The study proposes diagnostic recommendations, new areas of research and potential treatments, and cautions on treatment strategies and critical care conditions that induce elevations in blood glucose levels.","","Background Nutrition is a modifiable risk factor for ischemic stroke. As people age their ability to absorb some nutrients decreases, an example is vitamin B12. Older individuals with a vitamin B12 deficiency are at a higher risk for stroke and have worse outcome. However, the mechanisms through which these occur remain unknown.","","Background The identification of effective strategies capable of reducing the case mortality rate of high-risk COVID-19 is an urgent and unmet medical need. We recently reported the clinical safety profile of RJX, a well-defined intravenous GMP-grade pharmaceutical formulation of anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory vitamins as active ingredients, in a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03680105) (Uckun et al., Front. Pharmacol. 11, 594321. 10.3389/fphar.2020.594321). Here we report data from a pilot clinical study (RPI-015) which examined the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of using RJX in combination with clinical standard of care (SOC) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with pneumonia (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04708340). In addition to our early clinical proof of concept (POC) data, we also present non-clinical POC from a mouse model of CRS and ARDS that informed the design of the reported clinical study.","Objectives To the best of our knowledge, there is no published study regarding use of IFN \u03b2-1a in the treatment of severe COVID-19. In this randomized clinical trial efficacy and safety of IFN \u03b2-1a has been evaluated in patients with severe COVID-19.","Objectives To investigate prevalence of beliefs in COVID-19 misinformation and examine whether demographic, psychosocial and cognitive factors are associated with these beliefs, and how they change over time.","Sepsis manifests due to the host\u2019s dysregulated immune response to an infection. High dose ascorbic acid (AA) has emerged as a potential treatment of sepsis, yet little is known regarding how ascorbic acid influences the immune system in sepsis, such as monocytes. The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of high dose AA on monocyte polarization and cytokine production in vitro.","Background The characterization of new biomarkers of COVID-19 is extremely important. Few studies measured the soluble receptor for advanced glycation end product (sRAGE), angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), calcium and magnesium in COVID-19.","Atrazine is an herbicide and pollutant of great environmental concern that is naturally biodegraded by microbial communities. Paenarthrobacter aurescens TC1 is one of the most studied degraders of this herbicide. Here, we developed a genome scale metabolic model for P. aurescens TC1, iRZ1176, in order to study the atrazine degradation process and mechanism at organism level. Constraint based flux balance analysis and time dependent simulations were used to explore the bacteria\u2019s phenotypic landscape. Simulations led to model based predictions for growth and atrazine degradation efficiency in myriad of media supplemented with different combinations of carbon and nitrogen sources. Simulations aimed at designing media optimized for supporting growth and enhancing degradation, bypassing the need in strain design via genetic modifications. Predictions were tested in vitro and experimental growth and degradation measurements support and validate the reliability of the model. Model simulations have prioritized degradation and growth enhancement effect of various amino acid and co-factors. The model presented here can potentially serve as a predictive tool towards achieving optimal biodegradation efficiencies and for the development of ecologically friendly solutions for pollutant degradation.","Behavioral genetics and cultural evolution have both revolutionized our understanding of human behavior, but largely independently of each other. Here we reconcile these two fields using a dual inheritance approach, which offers a more nuanced understanding of the interaction between genes and culture, and a resolution to several long-standing puzzles. For example, by neglecting how human environments are extensively shaped by cultural dynamics, behavioral genetic approaches systematically inflate heritability estimates and thereby overestimate the genetic basis of human behavior. A WEIRD (Western, educated, industrialized, rich, democratic) gene problem obscures this inflation. Considering both genetic and cultural evolutionary forces, heritability scores become less a property of a trait and more a moving target that responds to cultural and social changes. Ignoring cultural evolutionary forces leads to an over-simplified model of gene-to-phenotype causality. When cumulative culture functionally overlaps with genes, genetic effects become masked, or even reversed, and the causal effect of an identified gene is confounded with features of the cultural environment, specific to a particular society at a particular time. This framework helps explain why it is easier to discover genes for deficiencies than genes for abilities. With this framework, we predict the ways in which heritability should differ between societies, between socioeconomic levels within some societies but not others, and over the life course. An integrated cultural evolutionary behavioral genetics cuts through the nature\u2013nurture debate and elucidates controversial topics such as general intelligence.","Mass Spectrometry imaging (MS imaging) provides spatial information for a wide range of compound classes in different sample matrices. We used MS imaging to investigate the distribution of components in fresh and processed food, including meat, dairy and bakery products. The MS imaging workflow was optimized to cater to the specific properties and challenges of the individual samples. We successfully detected highly nonpolar and polar constituents such as beta-carotene and anthocyanins, respectively. For the first time, the distribution of a contaminant and a food additive was visualized in processed food. We detected acrylamide in German gingerbread and investigated the penetration of the preservative natamycin into cheese. For this purpose, a new data analysis tool was developed to study the penetration of analytes from uneven surfaces. Our results show that MS imaging has great potential in food analysis to provide relevant information about components\u2019 distributions, particularly those underlying official regulations.","Diet modulates the gut microbiome, and gut microbes, in turn, can impact the immune system. Here, we used two gut microbiota-targeted dietary interventions, plant-based fiber or fermented foods, to determine how each influences the human microbiome and immune system in healthy adults. Using a 17-week randomized, prospective study design combined with -omics measurements of microbiome and host, including extensive immune profiling, we found distinct effects of each diet. High-fiber consumers showed increased gut microbiome-encoded glycan-degrading CAZymes despite stable community diversity. Three distinct immunological trajectories in high fiber-consumers corresponded to baseline microbiota diversity. Alternatively, the high-fermented food diet steadily increased microbiota diversity and decreased inflammatory markers. The data highlight how coupling dietary interventions to deep and longitudinal immune and microbiome profiling can provide individualized and population-wide insight. Our results indicate that fermented foods may be valuable in countering the decreased microbiome diversity and increased inflammation pervasive in the industrialized society.","The diverse cultivars of Brassica oleracea and Brassica napus constitute an important global food source. Of those, the Brassica oleracea convar. acephala cultivar group containing var. sabellica and var. palmifolia and Brassica napus var. pabularia, collectively known as kale, are nutritious leafy greens consumed for their abundance of vitamins and micronutrients. Typified by their curly, serrated or wavy leaves, kale varieties have been primarily defined based on their leaf morphology and geographic origin, despite having complex genetic backgrounds. Kale is a very promising crop for vertical farming due to its high nutritional content. However, systematic analysis of kale growth and molecular composition under different light regimes suitable for vertical farming has been lacking. Hence, we selected nine diverse, publicly available and commercially grown kale cultivars for growth under light emitting diode (LED)-replicated sunlight-like conditions. We then analyzed their growth and nutrition using a combination of phenomics, proteomics and metabolomics. As plant growth and development are driven by the diel molecular activities of plants, we harvested kale leaf tissue at both end-of-day (ED) and end-of-night (EN) time-points for all molecular analyses. Our results reveal that diel metabolome and proteome signatures sub-divide the selected kale cultivars into two distinct groups, defined by their amino acid and sugar content, along with significant proteome differences involving carbon and nitrogen metabolism, mRNA splicing, protein translation and light harvesting. Together, our analysis has generated robust quantitative insights into the diel growth and development landscape of kale, significantly advancing our fundamental understanding of this nutritious leafy green for next-generation breeding and biotechnology.","Pesticide exposure is associated with cognitive and psychomotor disorders. Glyphosate-based herbicides (GlyBH) are among the most used agrochemicals, and inhalation of GlyBH sprays may arise from frequent aerial pulverizations. Previously, we described that intranasal (IN) administration of GlyBH in mice decreases locomotor activity, increases anxiety, and impairs recognition memory. Then, the aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanisms involved in GlyBH neurotoxicity after IN administration. Adult male CF-1 mice were exposed to GlyBH IN administration (equivalent to 50 mg/kg/day of Gly acid, 3 days a week, during 4 weeks). Total thiol content and the activity of the enzymes catalase, acetylcholinesterase and transaminases were evaluated in different brain areas. In addition, markers of the cholinergic and the nigrostriatal pathways, as well as of astrocytes were evaluated by fluorescence microscopy in coronal brain sections. The brain areas chosen for analysis were those seen to be affected in our previous study. GlyBH IN administration impaired the redox balance of the brain and modified the activities of enzymes involved in cholinergic and glutamatergic pathways. Moreover, GlyBH treatment decreased the number of cholinergic neurons in the medial septum as well as the expression of the \u03b17-acetylcholine receptor in the hippocampus. Also, the number of astrocytes increased in the anterior olfactory nucleus of the exposed mice. Taken together, these disturbances may contribute to the neurobehavioural impairments reported previously by us after IN GlyBH administration in mice.","In plants, it is well-known that ascorbic acid (vitamin C) can be synthesized via multiple metabolic pathways but there is still much to be learnt concerning their integration and control mechanisms. Furthermore, the structural biology of the component enzymes has been poorly exploited. Here we describe the first crystal structure for an L-galactose dehydrogenase (SoGDH from spinach), from the D-mannose/L-galactose (Smirnoff Wheeler) pathway which converts L-galactose into L-galactono-1,4-lactone. The kinetic parameters for the enzyme are similar to those from its homologue from camu-camu, a super-accumulator of vitamin C found in the Peruvian amazon. Both enzymes are monomers in solution, have a pH optimum of 7 and their activity is largely unaffected by high concentrations of ascorbic acid, suggesting the absence of a feedback mechanism acting via GDH. Previous reports may have been influenced by changes of the pH of the reaction medium as a function of ascorbic acid concentration. The structure of SoGDH is dominated by a (\u03b2/\u03b1)8 barrel closely related to aldehyde-keto reductases (AKRs). The structure bound to NAD+ shows that the lack of Arg279 justifies its preference for NAD+ over NADP+, as employed by many AKRs. This favours the oxidation reaction which ultimately leads to ascorbic acid accumulation. When compared with other AKRs, residue substitutions at the C-terminal end of the barrel (Tyr185, Tyr61, Ser59 and Asp128) can be identified to be likely determinants of substrate specificity. The present work contributes towards a more comprehensive understanding of structure-function relationships in the enzymes involved in vitamin C synthesis.","Gluconobacter oxydans plays important role in conversion of D-sorbitol to L-sorbose, which is an essential intermediate for industrial-scale production of vitamin C. In the fermentation process, some D-sorbitol could be converted to D-fructose and other byproducts by uncertain dehydrogenases. Genome sequencing has revealed the presence of diverse genes encoding dehydrogenases in G. oxydans. However, the characteristics of most of these dehydrogenases remain unclear. Therefore, analyses of these unknown dehydrogenases could be useful for identifying those related to the production of D-fructose and other byproducts. Accordingly, dehydrogenases in G. oxydans WSH-003, an industrial strain used for vitamin C production, were examined. An NAD-dependent dehydrogenase, which was annotated as xylitol dehydrogenase 2, was identified, codon-optimized, and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells. The enzyme exhibited high preference for NAD+ as the cofactor, while no activity with NADP+, FAD, or PQQ was noted. Although this enzyme presented high similarity with NAD-dependent xylitol dehydrogenase, it showed high activity to catalyze D-sorbitol to D-fructose. Unlike the optimum temperature and pH for most of the known NAD-dependent xylitol dehydrogenases (30\u00b0C\u201340\u00b0C and about 6\u20138, respectively), those for the identified enzyme were 57\u00b0C and 12, respectively. The Km and Vmax of the identified dehydrogenase towards L-sorbitol were 4.92 \u03bcM and 196.08 \u03bcM/min, respectively. Thus, xylitol dehydrogenase 2 can be useful for cofactor NADH regeneration under alkaline conditions or its knockout can improve the conversion ratio of D-sorbitol to L-sorbose.","A major conceptual gap in taste biology is the lack of a general framework for understanding the evolution of different taste modalities among animal species. We turn to two complementary nutritional frameworks, biological stoichiometry theory and nutritional geometry, to develop hypotheses for the evolution of different taste modalities in animals. We describe how the attractive tastes of Na, Ca, P, N and C containing compounds are consistent with principles of both frameworks based on their shared focus on nutritional imbalances and consumer homeostasis. Specifically, we suggest that the evolution of multiple nutritive taste modalities can be predicted by identifying individual elements that are typically more concentrated in the tissues of animals than plants. Additionally, we discuss how consumer homeostasis can inform our understanding of why some taste compounds (i.e., Na, Ca and P salts) can be either attractive or aversive depending on concentration. We also discuss how these complementary frameworks can help to explain the phylogenetic distribution of different taste modalities and improve our understanding of the mechanisms that lead to loss of taste capabilities in some animal lineages. The ideas presented here will stimulate research that bridges the fields of evolutionary biology, sensory biology and ecology.","Hedysarum neglectum is a forage plant. Xanthone glycoside - mangiferin is extracted from this plant and used for medicine \u201cAlpizarin\u201d. In addition to substances of xanthone nature (mangiferin and isomangiferin) Hedysarum neglectum contains sugars, vitamins and provitamins, tannins; in the underground part it contains oligomeric catechins, isoflavonoids, butylphenols, alkaloids, tannins, flavonoids, saponins, coumarins, carbohydrates, vitamin C. For selecting optimal schemes of fractionization of substances, it is necessary to resort to multi-stage schemes of group-wide (preliminary) isolation and preparative accumulation. In particular cases, it is necessary to take into account the presence of concomitant substances, as well as the effectiveness and selectivity of the sorption-chromatographic technologies used. According to the results of the studies, the use of silica gel and sefadex LH-20 for the isolation of a complex of flavonoids and gallic acid is the most effective method for the selection of the optimal variant of the preparative isolation of the total amount of BAS in mcg/ml. The results of the research allowed us to identify the target biologically active substances with a degree of extraction of at least 80%: - fractions of xanthones, flavonoids, gallic acid.","This is the first report on cryopreservation via PVS2 vitrification method on roses using in vitro fragmented explants (IFEs) as the starting material. The aim of this study is to optimize the efficient plant recovery and regeneration system for cryopreservation of Rosa hybrida cv. Helmut Schmidt using IFEs. Some important parameters have been optimized in this study are the effect of ascorbic acid (0.3 mM) examined separately and in combination at all steps in cryopreservation procedure (preculture, loading, unloading and growth recovery), loading type, loading duration, and PVS2 duration. The highest growth recovery of 43.33% was obtained when 3-4 mm size IFEs precultured on 0.25 M sucrose media supplemented with full-strength MS for one (1) day, followed by loading treatment supplemented with 1.5 M glycerol + 0.4 M sucrose + 5% DMSO + 0.3 mM ascorbic acid for 20 minutes, dehydration with PVS2 solution for 30 minutes and then treated with unloading solution supplemented with 1.2 M sucrose + 0.3 mM ascorbic acid for 20 minutes. This finding implies that long-term storage of Rosa Hybrida cv. Helmut Schmidt by PVS2 vitrification method was successful with essential biomolecules.","Successful antibiotic treatment of infections relies on accurate and rapid identification of the infectious agents. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is implicated in a wide range of human infections that almost complicated and become life threating especially in immunocompromised and critically ill patients. Conventional microbiological methods take more than 3 days to obtain accurate results. Pyocyanin is a distinctive electroactive biomarker for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Here, we have developed a rapid diagnostic (polyaniline) PANI gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) modified indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode that showed 100% sensitivity for pyocyanin in culture of Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates and high selectivity for pyocyanin at low concentration when measured in the presence of other substances like ascorbic acid, uric acid, and glucose as interferences. The constructed electrode was characterized using scanning electron microscopy and cyclic voltammetry. The determined linear range for pyocyanin detection was from 238 \u00b5M to 1.9 \u00b5M with a detection limit of 500 nM. Compared to the screen-printed electrode used before, the constructed electrode showed a 4-fold enhanced performance.","","Recent reports have proposed a new paradigm for obtaining mature somatic cell types from fibroblasts without going through a pluripotent state, by briefly expressing canonical iPSC reprogramming factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc (abbreviated as OSKM) in cells expanded in lineage differentiation promoting conditions. Here we apply genetic lineage tracing for endogenous Nanog locus and X chromosome reactivation during OSKM induced trans-differentiation, as these molecular events mark final stages for acquisition of induced pluripotency. Remarkably, the majority of reprogrammed cardiomyocytes or neural stem cells derived from mouse fibroblasts via OSKM mediated trans-differentiation (\u223c&gt;90%), are attained after transient acquisition of pluripotency, and followed by rapid differentiation. Our findings underscore a molecular and functional coupling between inducing pluripotency and obtaining \u201ctrans-differentiated\u201d somatic cells via OSKM induction, and have implications on defining molecular trajectories assumed during different cell reprogramming methods.","L-ascorbic acid, commonly known as vitamin C, is a ubiquitous 6-carbon carbohydrate characterized by its ability to scavenge free radicals. In enteric bacteria, L-ascorbate can be utilized as a nutrient using the UlaABCDEF and UlaG-UlaRpathway under anaerobic conditions. In this study, we identified homologs of the Ula system within Vibrio cholerae and showed that V. cholerae is able to utilize L-ascorbate as an energy source. Growth pattern assays of a ulaG in-frame deletion mutant demonstrated that ulaG is essential for L-ascorbate fermentation. Expression analysis showed that ula catabolism and transport genes were significantly induced in cells grown in the presence of L-ascorbate compared to glucose and these genes were also highly induced during growth on intestinal mucus. In in vitro growth competition assays, the ulaG mutant was outcompeted by wild type when grown in intestinal mucus suggesting the Ula system could be important for fitness. Within the ula operon in V. cholerae and all Vibrio species a homology of ORF VCA0243 is present that encodes a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) phosphatase. This enzyme in E. coli, converts the active form of vitamin B6 PLP to its inactive form pyridoxal (PL). In V. splendidus and related species, the aerobic and anaerobic L-ascorbate pathway genes cluster together and both systems contain a PLP phosphatase. An in-frame deletion mutant of vca0243 resulted in a growth defect in L-ascorbate fermentation as well as additional carbon and amino acid sources indicating a role in cellular metabolism. Phylogenetic analysis of UlaG and UlaD suggested the region was acquired by horizontal gene transfer.","Wheatgrass has emerged as a functional food source in recent years, but the detailed metabolomics basis for its health benefits remains poorly understood. In this study, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis were used to study the metabolic profiling of seedlings from wheat, barley, rye and triticale, which revealed 1800 features in positive mode and 4303 features in negative mode. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed clear differences between species, and 164 differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) were detected, including amino acids, organic acids, lipids, fatty acids, nucleic acids, flavonoids, amines, polyamines, vitamins, sugar derivatives and others. Unique metabolites in each species were identified. This study provides a glimpse into the metabolomics profiles of wheat and its wild relatives, which may form an important basis for nutrition, health and other parameters.","","In a social context of increasingly concern about healthy diets, the development of new varieties with enhanced content in nutraceutical compounds is an increasingly important objective of the fruit breeding programs currently developed. In this sense, apricot is a fruit crop very appreciated by consumers due to its organoleptic characteristics, but also plays an important role in human nutrition due to its contain of phytocompounds as sugars, organic acids, vitamins and polyphenols. In this work, new selections from the apricot breeding program carried out at the Instituto Valenciano de Investigaciones Agrarias (IVIA) and traditional varieties have been analysed aimed at identifying sources of genetic variation for fruit quality. For this purpose, sugar content, organic acids and ascorbic acid were studied during two crop years. Results revealed sucrose and glucose as the major sugars, malic and citric acid as the main organic acids, and diverse ascorbic acid content among the cultivars studied. Results obtained pointed some accessions as potential sources to increase fruit quality. In addition, the study showed that apricot peel is an excellent source of nutraceutical compounds. Moreover, this study opens up new possibilities for future work to study the genetic control of these traits in apricot.","The aim of this study is to explore the optimal N, P and K fertilization model suitable for pear-jujube in the mountain of northern Shaanxi in 2016 years. This experiment use 3-factor, saturated optimal design for quadratic fertilization scheme. The effects of different fertilization treatments on the yield and quality of pear-jujube were studied through field experiments. And comprehensive evaluation based on the quality of pear-jujube. The results showed that N1P3K3 has the highest yield, which is 48% higher than the control (CK). The effect of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium on yield is potassium fertilizer (positive effect)&gt; phosphate fertilizer (positive effect)&gt; nitrogen fertilizer (negative effect). Phosphate and potassium fertilizers have significant effects on increasing the content of soluble solids. Application of potassium fertilizer alone can significantly increase the content of reduced Vitamins c. The combined application of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium reduced the content of reduced Vitamins c. N3P3K1 treatment can significantly increase the total sugar content in fruits. Single application of phosphate and potassium increases the content of organic acids in fruits. Other fertilization treatments have significant effects on reducing the content of organic acids in fruits. The sugar-acid ratio of N3P3K1 is significantly higher than CK, which had an important effect on improving the taste. A high amount of potassium fertilizer has a significant effect on increasing the total flavonoid content in fruits. The interaction of nitrogen and phosphorus will reduce the total flavonoid content. The effect of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium on quality is potassium (positive effect)&gt; nitrogen (positive effect)&gt; phosphate (positive effect). Comprehensive analysis, the optimal fertilization amount when the target yield is 23000 \u223c 27000 kg\u00b7hm-2 and the quality score is above 85 is nitrogen (N) 406.93 \u223c 499.31 kg\u00b7hm-2, phosphorus (P2O5) 203.94 \u223c 297.08 kg\u00b7hm-2, and potassium (K2O) 285.47 \u223c 322.82 kg\u00b7hm-2.","In the adult mammalian brain, up-regulation of serotonin via the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine increases hippocampal neurogenesis. However, research assessing the long-term effects of modulating serotonin during the developmental period on hippocampal neurogenesis, is sparse. Here we evaluated hippocampal neurogenesis early (postnatal day 12), and later in life (postnatal day 60), in the offspring of mouse dams that were administered fluoxetine in their drinking water from embryonic day 15 (E15) through postnatal day 12 (P12). Fluoxetine-exposed mice had significantly higher levels of neuronal proliferation at P12, and P60, despite cessation of fluoxetine on P12. These effects were limited to proliferation, as survival of postnatal-born hippocampal neurons was unaltered. Mice exposed to fluoxetine also showed significantly higher levels of cell death, suggesting that homeostatic mechanisms present within the hippocampus may limit integration of adult-born neurons into the existing neuronal network. These findings demonstrate modulation of serotonin during development may be sufficient to induce long-lasting changes in hippocampal neurogenesis.","In this study, Lentinus edodes (or mushroom) powder and carrot juice were used as raw materials to prepare a new type of nutritious cakes. Microencapsulation was applied in embedding vitamin C to prevent the loss of this vitamin during baking at high temperatures. The most suitable addition amount of each materials was optimized via single-factor test and response surface analysis. The optimal microencapsulation of shiitake mushroom powder with carrot juice required 10 g of mushroom powder, 35 g of soft sugar, 50 mL of carrot juice and 160 g of egg white. The cake prepared herein was rich in nutrient and exuded a unique flavor. This cake was prepared via modern processing technologies and efficient detection techniques. Microencapsulation not only improves the nutritional value of traditional flour products but also expands the scope of research on food processing technologies.","The earth has become increasingly overcrowded as a result of rapid urbanization and population growth, predicting that its carrying capacity could be overstretched. As a result, it is important to test the possibilities of growing plants under space exploration conditions, especially gravitational balance. Since microgravity impedes plant development, to what extent can plant growth stimulators reverse or enhance this trend? A total of 12 maize seeds were weighed and placed sideways in petri dish and inoculated with plant growth stimulators such as indole acetic acid (IAA), gibberellic acid (GA), and ascorbate (AA) and the clinorotated at different rates (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 rpm), while control seeds were just placed on a table. Results showed that at 72 hrs, the maize seeds under microgravity showed reduced germination percentage with increasing clinorotation rates as against the control. But when stimulated with IAA, GA and AA, improved germination percentage was observed as against the control even under microgravity condition. The seedling dry weight, germination time and other germination parameters also showed similar improvements. Comparatively, the three growth stimulators showed no major variations in their ability to improve germination percentage under microgravitational impact. However, IAA showed more improvement on seedling vigor as against others, while GA showed more effect on the peak time and rate of germination. This research confirmed the possibilities of improving germinability of maize seeds under space exploration condition.","Extensive studies were carried out during 2017-2019 to evaluate the Hippophae salicifolia (Seabuckthorn) biodiversity in Uttarakhand for their physico-chemical/biochemical parameters of ripe fruits like acidity (1.78-3.01 %), pH (2.15-2.87), Vitamin \u2018C\u2019 (271-494mg/100g), Total soluble solids (5.1-9.8) etc. Variation was also observed in fruit color (light yellow, yellow, light yellow orange, orange and orange red), fruit size (length 6.29-8.77mm, width 4.80-7.59mm), Juice (44.23-76.18%), Pomace (8.01-28.30%) and seed (6.8-21.1%). On the basis of above parameters, promising morphotypes were identified and conserved at field gene bank at DIBER field station, Auli (Joshimath) 3142m AMSL.","Plant-beneficial microorganisms are gaining importance for sustainable plant production and phytosanitary practices. Yet there is a lack of computational approaches targeting bacterial traits associated with plant growth-promotion (PGP), which hinders the in-silico identification, comparison, and selection of phytostimulatory bacterial strains. To address this problem, we have developed the new web resource PLaBAse (v1.01, http://plabase.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/pb/plabase.php), which provides a number of services, including (i) a database for screening 5,565 plant-associated bacteria (PLaBA-db), (ii) a tool for predicting plant growth-promoting traits (PGPTs) of single bacterial genomes (PGPT-Pred), and (iii) a tool for the prediction of bacterial plant-association by marker gene identification (PIFAR-Pred). The latter was developed by Mart\u00ednez-Garc\u00eda et al. and is now hosted at University of Tuebingen. The PGPT-Pred tool is based on our new PGPT ontology, a literature- and OMICs-curated, comprehensive, and hierarchical collection of \u223c6,900 PGPTs that are associated with 6,965,955 protein sequences. To study the distribution of the PGPTs across different environments, we applied it to 70,540 bacterial strains associated with (i) seven different environments (including plants), (iii) five different plant spheres (organs), and (iii) two bacteria-induced plant phenotypes. This analysis revealed that plant-symbiotic bacteria generally have a larger genome size and a higher count of PGPT-annotated protein encoding genes. Obviously, not all reported PGPTs are restricted to -or only enriched in-plant-associated and plant symbiotic bacteria. Some also occur in human- and animal-associated bacteria, perhaps due to the transmission of PGP bacteria (PGPBs) between environments, or because some functions are involved in adaption processes to various environments. Here we provide an easy-to-use approach for screening of PGPTs in bacterial genomes across various phyla and isolation sites, using PLaBA-db, and for standardized annotation, using PGPT-Pred. We believe that this resource will improve our understanding about the entire PGP processes and facilitate the prediction of PGPB as bio-inoculants and for biosafety strategies, so as to help to establish sustainable and targeted bacteria-incorporated plant production systems in the future.","","","The plasticity of human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) has been observed during proliferative vitreoretinopathy, a defective repair process during which injured RPE gives rise to fibrosis. In contrast, following injury, the RPE of the embryonic chicken can be reprogrammed to regenerate neural retina in an FGF2-dependent manner. To characterize the mechanisms underlying embryonic RPE reprogramming, we used laser capture microdissection to isolate RNA from 1) intact RPE, 2) transiently reprogrammed RPE (t-rRPE) 6 hours post-retinectomy, and 3) reprogrammed RPE (rRPE) 6 hours post-retinectomy with FGF2 treatment. Using RNA-seq, we observed the acute repression of genes related to cell cycle progression in the injured t-rRPE, as well as up-regulation of genes associated with injury. In contrast, the rRPE was strongly enriched for MAPK-responsive genes and retina development factors, confirming that FGF2 and the downstream MAPK cascade are the main drivers of embryonic RPE reprogramming. Clustering and pathway enrichment analysis were used to create an integrated network of the core processes associated with RPE reprogramming, including key terms pertaining to injury response, migration, actin dynamics, and cell cycle progression. Finally, we employed gene set enrichment analysis to suggest a previously uncovered role for epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) machinery in the initiation of embryonic chick RPE reprogramming. The EMT program is accompanied by extensive, coordinated regulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) regulators, and these observations together suggest an early role for ECM and EMT-like dynamics during reprogramming. Our study provides for the first time an in-depth transcriptomic analysis of embryonic RPE reprogramming and will prove useful in guiding future efforts to understand proliferative disorders of the RPE and to promote retinal regeneration.","","","","","","There is wide variability in the propensity of somatic cells to reprogram into pluripotency in response to the Yamanaka factors. How to segregate these variability to enrich for cells of specific traits that reprogram efficiently remains challenging. Here we report that the variability in reprogramming propensity is associated with the activity of the MKL1/SRF transcription factor and concurs with small cell size as well as rapid cell cycle. Reprogramming progressive cells can be prospectively identified by their low activity of a widely used synthetic promoter, CAG. CAGlow cells arise and expand during cell cycle acceleration in the early reprogramming culture of both mouse and human fibroblasts. Our work illustrate a molecular scenario underlying the distinct reprogramming propensities and demonstrate a convenient practical approach for their enrichment.","","Our study employed the detection of 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine (5hmC) profiles on cell free DNA (cfDNA) from the plasma of cancer patients using a novel enrichment technology coupled with sequencing and machine learning based classification method. These classification methods were develoiped to detect the presence of disease in the plasma of cancer and control subjects. Cancer and control patient cfDNA cohorts were accrued from multiple sites consisting of 48 breast, 55 lung, 32 prostate and 53 pancreatic cancer subjects. In addition, a control cohort of 180 subjects (non-cancer) was employed to match cancer patient demographics (age, sex and smoking status) in a case-control study design.","","","","Methamphetamine (Meth) is a powerful illicit psychostimulant, widely used for recreational purposes. Besides disrupting the monoaminergic system and promoting oxidative brain damage, Meth also causes neuroinflammation that contributes to synaptic dysfunction and behavioral deficits. Aberrant activation of microglia, the largest myeloid cell population in the brain, is a common feature in neurological disorders linked to cognitive impairment and neuroinflammation. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the aberrant activation of microglia elicited by Meth in the adult mouse brain. We found that binge Meth exposure caused microgliosis and disrupted risk assessment behavior (a feature that usually occurs in human Meth abusers), both of which required astrocyte-to-microglia crosstalk. Mechanistically, Meth triggered a detrimental increase of glutamate exocytosis from astrocytes (in a manner dependent on TNF production and calcium mobilization), promoting microglial expansion and reactivity. Ablating TNF production or suppressing astrocytic calcium mobilization prevented microglia reactivity and abolished the behavioral phenotype elicited by Meth exposure. Overall, our data indicate that glial crosstalk is critical to relay behavioral alterations caused by acute Meth exposure.","Silver-based antimicrobials are widely used topically to treat infections associated with multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens. Expanding this topical use to aerosols to treat lung infections requires understanding and preventing silver toxicity in the respiratory tract. A key mechanism resulting in silver-induced toxicity is the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this study, we have verified ROS generation in silver-treated bronchial epithelial (16HBE) cells prompting evaluation of three antioxidants, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), ascorbic acid, and melatonin, to identify potential prophylactic agents. Among them, NAC was the only candidate that abrogated the ROS generation in response to silver exposure resulting in the rescue of these cells from silver-associated toxicity. Further, this protective effect directly translated to restoration of metabolic activity, as demonstrated by the normal levels of citric acid cycle metabolites in NAC-pretreated silver-exposed cells. As a result of the normalized citric acid cycle, cells pre-incubated with NAC demonstrated significantly higher levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels compared with NAC-free controls. Moreover, we found that this prodigious capacity of NAC to rescue silver-exposed cells was due not only to its antioxidant activity, but also to its ability to directly bind silver. Despite binding to silver, NAC did not alter the antimicrobial activity of silver.","Aim To evaluate associations of plasma 25(OH)D status with the likelihood of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection and hospitalization.","This paper aimed to give the visibility of Latin American researchers\u2019 contributions to the comprehension of COVID-19; our method was a literature review. Currently, the world is facing a health and socioeconomic crisis caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, and its disease COVID-19. Therefore, in less than four months, researchers have published a significant number of articles related to this novel virus. For instance, a search focused on the Scopus database on April 10, 2020, showed 1224 documents published by authors with 1797 affiliations from 80 countries. 25.4%, 24.0%, and 12.6% of these national affiliations were from China, Europe, and the USA, respectively, making these regions leaders in COVID-19 research. In the case of Latin America, on April 10, 2020, we searched different databases, such as Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science, finding that the contribution of this region was 2.7\u00b10.6% of the total publications found. In other words, we found 153 publications related to COVID-19 with at least one Latin American researcher. We summarized and processed the information from these 153 publications, finding active participation in topics like medical, social, and environmental considerations, bioinformatics, and epidemiology.","Midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons are associated with locomotor and psychiatric disorders. DA subtype is specified in ancestral neural precursor cells (NPCs) and maintained throughout neuronal differentiation. Here we show that endogenous expression of MeCP2 coincides with DA subtype specification in mouse mesencephalon, and premature expression of MeCP2 prevents in vitro cultured NPCs from acquiring DA subtype through interfering NURR1 transactivation of DA phenotype genes. By contrast, MeCP2 overexpression does not disturb DA subtype in DA neurons. By analyzing the dynamic change of DNA methylation along DA neuronal differentiation at the promoter of DA phenotype gene tyrosine hydroxylase (Th), we show that Th expression is determined by TET1-mediated de-methylation of NURR1 binding sites within Th promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that MeCP2 dominates the DNA binding of the corresponding sites thereby blocking TET1 function in DA NPCs, whereas TET1-mediated de-methylation prevents excessive MeCP2 binding in DA neurons. The significance of temporal DNA methylation status is further confirmed by targeted methylation/demethylation experiments showing that targeted de-methylation in DA NPCs protects DA subtype specification from MeCP2 overexpression, whereas targeted methylation disturbs subtype maintenance in MeCP2-overexpressed DA neurons. These findings suggest the appropriate timing of MeCP2 expression as a novel determining factor for guiding NPCs into DA lineage.","Background Particulate matter (PM) pollutant exposure, which induces oxidative stress and inflammation, and vitamin D insufficiency, which compromises immune regulation, are detrimental in asthma.","Background Micronutrients are essential for the body to produce enzymes, hormones and other substances essential for proper growth and development. Iodine, potassium iodide and ascorbic acid are ones of the most important in global public health terms. However, their lack represents a major threat to the human and animal health.","","","The purpose of this study is to elucidate the apoptotic activity of Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharide (GLP) in a human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 in vitro. According to DPPH assay, GLP showed a good antioxidant (IC50 value is 202.4 \u03bcg/mL). Based on MTT assay, the results showed that GLP inhibits MCF-7 cells proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner (p&lt;0.001). IC50 values of the cytotoxicity of GLP and doxorubin were 110.907 \u03bcg/mL and 58.206 \u03bcg/mL respectively. The results from the flow cytometry indicated that GLP could induce apoptotic activity through inducing the up-regulation of the Bax and Caspase-9 and the down-regulation of the BcL-2 in MCF-7 cells. At 2\u00d7IC50, GLP increased the early-apoptotic and dead cells of MCF-7 from 18.23% to 34.76% and 8.45% to16.34% respectively. In conclusion, the GLP shows anticancer activity against MCF-7 through preventing the proliferation and inducing the apoptosis of MCF-7 cells. Our data provide the potential molecular targets in cancer prevention and reveal the key barriers in the current anticancer drugs development.","Around 60% of in vitro fertilized (IVF) human embryos irreversibly arrest before compaction between the 3-8-cell stage, posing a significant clinical problem. The mechanisms behind this arrest are unclear. Here, we show that the arrested embryos enter a quiescent-like state, marked by cell cycle arrest, the downregulation of ribosomes and histones and downregulation of MYC and p53 activity. Mechanistically, the arrested embryos can be divided into three types. Type I embryos fail to complete the maternal-zygotic transition, and type II/III embryos have erroneously low levels of glycolysis and variable levels of oxidative phosphorylation. Treatment with resveratrol or nicotinamide riboside (NR) can partially rescue the arrested phenotype. The mechanism of reactivation involves the upregulation of SIRT1, and activation of glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation which forces the embryos out of a quiescent state. Overall, our data reveal how human embryo arrest can be overcome by modulating metabolic pathways.","\u03b2 cells may participate and contribute to their own demise during Type 1 diabetes (T1D). We identified a novel role of Tet2 in regulating immune killing of \u03b2 cells. Tet2 is induced in murine and human \u03b2 cells with inflammation but its expression is reduced in surviving \u03b2 cells. Tet2-KO mice that receive WT bone marrow transplants develop insulitis but not diabetes and islet infiltrates do not eliminate \u03b2 cells even though immune cells from the mice can transfer diabetes to NOD/scid recipients. Tet2-KO \u03b2 cells show reduced expression of inflammatory genes, associated with closed transcription factor binding sites. Tet2-KO recipients are protected from transfer of disease by diabetogenic immune cells. We conclude that Tet2 regulates pathologic interactions between \u03b2 cells and immune cells and controls intrinsic protective pathways. Modulating TET2 may enable survival of \u03b2 cells or their replacements in the setting of pathologic immune cells.","Cancer of gastrointestinal tract, such as colorectal cancer (CRC) and gastric cancer (GC), are common types of cancer globally and their origin can be linked to oxidative stress conditions. Commonly available antioxidants, such as vitamins C and E, are widely considered as potential anti-cancer agents. Raman spectra have great potential in the biochemical characterization of matter based on the fact that each molecule has its own unique vibrational properties. Raman spectroscopy allows to precisely characterized cell substructures (nucleus, mitochondria, cytoplasm, cell membrane) and components (proteins, lipids, nucleic acids).","","","","Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD) and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) share a common hallmark of insulin resistance. Besides Insulin Receptor (IR), two non-canonical RTKs, ALK and RYK, exhibit significant and consistent functional downregulation in post-mortem AD and T2D tissues. Incidentally, both have Grb2 as a common downstream adapter and NOX4 as a common ROS producing factor. Here we show that Grb2 and NOX4 play critical roles in reducing the severity of both the diseases. The study demonstrates that the abundance of Grb2 in degenerative conditions, in conjunction with NOX4, reverse cytoskeletal degradation by counterbalancing the network of small GTPases. PAX4, a transcription factor for both Grb2 and NOX4, emerges as the key link between the common pathways of AD and T2D. Both ALK and RYK downregulation elevate the PAX4 level by reducing its suppressor ARX via Wnt/\u03b2-Catenin signaling pathway. For the first time, this study brings together RTKs other than Insulin Receptor (IR), their common transcription factor PAX4 and both AD and T2D pathologies on a common regulatory platform.","A biological life support system for spaceflight would capture carbon dioxide waste produced by living and working in space to generate useful organic compounds. Photosynthesis is the primary mechanism to fix carbon into organic molecules. Microalgae are highly efficient at converting light, water, and carbon dioxide into biomass, particularly under limiting, artificial light conditions that are a necessity in space photosynthetic production. Although there is great promise in developing algae for chemical or food production in space, most spaceflight algae growth studies have been conducted on solid agar-media to avoid handling liquids in microgravity. Here we report that breathable plastic tissue culture bags can support robust growth of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in the Veggie plant growth chamber, which is used on the International Space Station to grow terrestrial plants. Live cultures can be stored for at least one month in the bags at room temperature. The gene set required for growth in these photobioreactors was tested through a short-wave ultraviolet light (UVC) mutagenesis and selection experiment with wild-type (CC-5082) and cw15 mutant (CC-1883) strains. Genome sequencing identified UVC-induced mutations, which were enriched for transversions and nonsynonymous mutations relative to natural variants among laboratory strains. Genes with mutations indicating positive selection were enriched for information processing genes related to DNA repair, RNA processing, translation, cytoskeletal motors, kinases, and ABC transporters. These data suggest modification of signal transduction and metabolite transport may be needed to improve growth rates in this spaceflight production system.","Differentiated cell nuclei can be reprogrammed after nuclear transfer (NT) to oocytes and the produced NT embryos can give rise to cloned animals. However, development of NT embryos is often hampered by recurrent reprogramming failures, including the incomplete activation of developmental genes, yet specific genes responsible for the arrest of NT embryos are not well understood. Here, we searched for developmentally important genes among the reprogramming-resistant H3K9me3-repressed genes, and identified Alyref and Gabpb1 by siRNA screening. Gene knockout of Alyref and Gabpb1 by the CRISPR/Cas9 system resulted in early developmental arrest in mice. Single embryo RNA-seq revealed that Alyref is needed for the formation of inner cell mass. The supplement of Alyref and Gabpb1 by mRNA injection supported efficient preimplantation development of cloned embryos. Thus, our study shows that the H3K9me3-repressed genes contain developmentally required genes and the incomplete activation of such genes results in preimplantation arrest of cloned embryos.","The plant phenylpropanoid pathway generates a major class of specialized metabolites and precursors of essential extracellular polymers that initially appeared upon plant terrestrialization. Despite its evolutionary significance, little is known about the complexity and function of this major metabolic pathway in extant bryophytes, which represent the non-vascular stage of embryophyte evolution. Here, we report that the HYDROXYCINNAMOYL-CoA:SHIKIMATE HYDROXYCINNAMOYL TRANSFERASE (HCT) gene that plays a critical function in the phenylpropanoid pathway during seed plant development, is functionally conserved in Physcomitrium patens (Physcomitrella), in the moss lineage of bryophytes. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that bonafide HCT function emerged in the progenitor of embryophytes. In vitro enzyme assays, moss phenolic pathway reconstitution in yeast and in planta gene inactivation coupled to targeted metabolic profiling, collectively indicate that P. patens HCT (PpHCT), similar to tracheophyte HCT orthologs, uses shikimate as a native acyl acceptor to produce a p-coumaroyl-5-O-shikimate intermediate. Phenotypic and metabolic analyses of loss-of-function mutants show that PpHCT is necessary for the production of caffeate derivatives, including previously reported caffeoyl-threonate esters, and for the formation of an intact cuticle. Deep conservation of HCT function in embryophytes is further suggested by the ability of HCT genes from P. patens and the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha to complement an Arabidopsis thaliana CRISPR/Cas9 hct mutant, and by the presence of phenolic esters of shikimate in representative species of the three bryophyte lineages.","","","Colorectal cancer is the second most frequently diagnosed cancer worldwide. Conventional diagnostics methods of colorectal cancer, can detect it in advanced stage.","","","Cells of the trophoblast lineage constitute the major part of placental tissues in higher mammals. Recent derivation of human trophoblast stem cells (TSC) from placental cytotrophoblasts (CT) and from human naive PSCs opens new opportunities for studying development and function of human placenta. Several recent reports have suggested that naive human PSCs retain an exclusive potential to give rise to bona fide TSCs. Here we report that inhibition of TGFbeta pathway and avoiding WNT stimulation, leads to direct and robust conversion of primed human pluripotent stem cells into TSCs. Systematic side by side comparative analysis showed that the latter are equivalent to previously derived TSC lines. Primed PSC derived TSC lines exhibit self-renewal, are able to differentiate into the main trophoblast lineages, and present RNA and epigenetic profiles that are indistinguishable from the TSC lines derived from placenta or naive PSCs. Our findings underscore a residual plasticity in primed human PSCs that allows converting directly into pre-implantation extra-embryonic cell lineages.","","","Background Reprogramming of somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and subsequent differentiation into iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iCM) seems to be a promising strategy for cardiac regenerative therapy. However, recent failure or poor outcomes in cardiac cell therapy warrants further investigation focusing on the infarction/wound environment (site of healing) to improve the cardiac regenerative medicine. Here, using next generation sequencing (NGS), we analyzed the global transcriptome to discover the unidentified genes/pathways that are crucial for cell survival, cytoprotection and mitochondrial dynamics during the differentiation of iPSC into iCM.","","Individual fingers in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) are known to be represented separately and adjacently, forming a cortical hand map. Electrophysiological studies in monkeys show that finger amputation triggers increased selectivity to the neighbouring fingers within the deprived S1, causing local reorganisation. Neuroimaging research in humans, however, shows persistent S1 finger representation of the missing hand, even decades after amputation. We aimed to resolve these apparently contrasting evidence by examining finger representation in humans following pharmacological \u2018amputation\u2019 using single-finger nerve block and 7T neuroimaging. We hypothesised that beneath the apparent selectivity of individual fingers in the hand map, peripheral and central processing is distributed across fingers. If each finger contributes to the cortical representation of the others, then localised input loss will weaken finger representation across the hand map. For the same reason, the non-blocked fingers will stabilise the blocked finger\u2019s representation, resulting in persistent representation of the blocked finger. Using univariate selectivity profiling, we replicated the electrophysiological findings of local S1 reorganisation. However, more comprehensive analyses confirmed that local blocking reduced representation of all fingers across the entire hand area. Importantly, multivariate analysis demonstrated that despite input loss, representation of the blocked finger remained persistent and distinct from the unblocked fingers. Computational modelling suggested that the observed findings are driven by distributed processing underlying the topographic map, combined with homeostatic mechanisms. Our findings suggest that the long-standing depiction of the somatosensory hand map is misleading. As such, accounts for map reorganisation, e.g. following amputation, need to be reconsidered.","Accumulating evidence has shown that cellular double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) induce antiviral innate immune responses in human normal and malignant cancer cells. However, it is not fully understood how endogenous \u2018self\u2019 dsRNA homeostasis is regulated in the cell. Here, we show that an RNA-binding protein, DEAD-box RNA helicase 3X (DDX3X), prevents the aberrant accumulation of cellular dsRNAs. Loss of DDX3X induces dsRNA sensor-mediated type I interferon signaling and innate immune response in breast cancer cells due to abnormal cytoplasmic accumulation of dsRNAs. Dual depletion of DDX3X and a dsRNA-editing protein, ADAR1 synergistically activates the cytosolic dsRNA pathway in breast cancer cell. Moreover, inhibiting DDX3X enhances the antitumor activity by increasing tumor intrinsic-type I interferon response, antigen presentation, and tumor-infiltration of cytotoxic T cells as well as dendritic cells in breast tumors, which may lead to the development of breast cancer therapy by targeting DDX3X in combination with immune checkpoint blockade.","Tumors are comprised of cancer cells and a network of non-cancerous stromal cells. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are well known to support tumorigenesis and are emerging as immune modulators. While many leukocyte populations are well studied in cancer, neutrophils have received less attention. Neutrophils can release histone-bound nuclear DNA and cytotoxic granules as extracellular traps (NETs) in a process termed NETosis. Here, we show that CAFs induce formation of NETs both within the tumor microenvironment and at systemic levels in the blood and bone marrow. These tumor-induced NETs (t-NETs) are driven by a ROS-mediated pathway dependent on PAD4 and CD11b. Remarkably, CAF-derived Amyloid \u03b2 was identified as the key factor driving t-NETosis, a protein with significance in both neurodegenerative and inflammatory disorders. Therapeutic inhibition of NETs in established tumors prevented growth, skewing neutrophils to a pro-inflammatory phenotype. Reciprocally, t-NETs enhanced CAF activation phenotypes. Mirroring murine observations, NETs were detected juxtaposed to CAFs in human melanoma and pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and elevated expression of amyloid and \u03b2-Secretase correlated with poor prognosis. In summary, we report the existence of cross-talk between CAFs and neutrophils within the tumour microenvironment whereby CAF-induced t-NETosis supports cancer progression, identifying Amyloid \u03b2 as the protagonist and potential therapeutic target.","","Munc13 proteins are priming factors for SNARE-dependent exocytosis, which are activated by diacylglycerol (DAG)-binding to their C1-domain. Several Munc13 paralogs exist, but their differential roles are not well understood. We studied the interdependence of phorbolesters (DAG mimics) with Munc13-1 and ubMunc13-2 in mouse adrenal chromaffin cells. Although expression of either Munc13-1 or ubMunc13-2 stimulated secretion, phorbolester was only stimulatory for secretion when ubMunc13-2 expression dominated, but inhibitory when Munc13-1 dominated. Accordingly, phorbolester stimulated secretion in wildtype cells, or cells overexpressing ubMunc13-2, but inhibited secretion in Munc13-2/Unc13b knockout (KO) cells or in cells overexpressing Munc13-1. Phorbolester was more stimulatory in the Munc13-1/Unc13a KO than in WT littermates, showing that endogenous Munc13-1 limits the effects of phorbolester. Imaging showed that ubMunc13-2, but not Munc13-1, traffics to the plasma membrane with a time-course matching Ca2+-dependent secretion, and trafficking is independent of synaptotagmin-7 (syt7). However, in the absence of syt7, phorbolester became inhibitory for both Munc13-1 and ubMunc13-2 driven secretion, indicating that stimulatory phorbolester x Munc13-2 interaction depends obligatorily on functional pairing with syt7. Overall, DAG/phorbolester, ubMunc13-2 and syt7 form a stimulatory triad for dense-core vesicle priming.","","Ascorbate (vitamin C) is an essential micronutrient in humans. The chronic severe deficiency of ascorbate, termed scurvy, has long been associated with increased susceptibility to infections. How ascorbate affects the immune system at the cellular and molecular levels remained unclear. Here, from a micronutrient screen, we identified ascorbate as a potent enhancer for antibody response by facilitating the IL-21/STAT3-dependent plasma cell differentiation in mouse and human B cells. The effect of ascorbate is unique, as other antioxidants failed to promote plasma cell differentiation. Ascorbate is critical during early B cell activation by poising the cells to plasma cell lineage without affecting the proximal IL-21/STAT3 signaling and the overall transcriptome. Consistent with its role as a cofactor for epigenetic enzymes, ascorbate potentiates plasma cell differentiation by remodeling the epigenome via TET (Ten Eleven Translocation), the enzymes responsible for DNA demethylation by oxidizing 5-methylcytosines into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). Genome-wide 5hmC profiling identified ascorbate responsive elements (EAR) at the Prdm1 locus, including a distal element with a STAT3 motif overlapped with a CpG that was methylated and modified by TET in the presence of ascorbate. The results suggest that an adequate level of VC is required for antibody response and highlight how micronutrients regulate the activity of epigenetic enzymes to regulate gene expression. Our findings imply that epigenetic enzymes can function as sensors to gauge the availability of metabolites and influence cell fate decisions.","Background In Kuwait, prior to the first case of COVID-19 being reported in the country, mass screening of incoming travelers from countries with known outbreaks was performed and resulted in the first identified cases in the country. All COVID-19 cases at the time and subsequently after, were transferred to a single center, Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Hospital, where the patients received standardized investigations and treatments. The objective of this study was to characterize the demographics, clinical manifestations and outcomes in this unique patient population.","","Objectives extracellular vesicles (EVs) represent key biological mediators of several physiological functions within the cell microenvironment. Platelets are the most abundant source of EVs in the blood, contributing to the plastic and versatile behaviour of these cells. Similarly, platelet lysate (PL), the best angiogenic performer of platelet origin and routinely employed for regenerative purposes, is enriched of EVs, but their role is still too poorly discovered to be suitably exploited. Here we explored the contribution of the EVs contained in PL, by investigating the biological and molecular features related to the angiogenic capacity extrapolated from that possessed by PL.","Neural stem cells (NSCs) have great potential in the application of neurodegenerative disease therapy, drug screening and disease modeling. NSC can be generated by reprogramming from terminally differentiated cells with transcription factors or small molecules. However, current methods for producing NSCs involve the danger of integrating foreign genes into the genome and the problem of low efficiency. Here, we report an efficient method to generate NSCs from human skin-derived fibroblasts with microRNA (mir-302a) in 2-3 days. The induced NSCs (iNSCs) have more than 90% of purity. Their morphology is similar to regular NSCs, expressing key markers including Nestin, Pax6 and Sox2, and can be expanded for more than 20 passages in vitro. They can also differentiate into functional neuron progeny, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes as well. Those cells can elicit action potential, can be xeno-transplanted into the brain of immune-deficient mice, and can survive and differentiate in vivo without tumor formation. This study shows that a single part of pluripotency-inducing mir-302 cluster can drive fibroblasts reprogramming, providing a general platform for high-efficiency generation of individual-specific human NSCs for studies of neuron system development and regenerative cell therapy.","","Polysaccharides from natural sources play a significant role in the management of different cancer types including gastric cancer. In this study, we reported the effect of spirulina polysaccharide (Sp) on galectin-3 modulatory activity on gastric cancer cells. The polysaccharide was isolated from the spirulina biomass, characterized, and the in silico, in vitro studies are carried out to assess the bioactivities. The isolated Sp possessed average molecular weight of 1457 kDa, and galactose (42%) as major sugar along with Rhamnose, Arabinose, Xylose, and Mannose. Further, characterization of Sp by FT-IR and NMR spectrum indicated the presence of (\u03b21-4D) galactose sugar with galactoarabinorhamnoglycan backbone. Among the monosaccharides, galactose showed highest binding affinity with galectin-3 protein as evidenced by the in silico interaction study. The obtained Sp, inhibited the proliferation of AGS gastric cancer cells by 48 % without affecting normal NIH/3T3 cells as opposed to doxorubicin, a known anticancer drug. Also, Sp exhibited galectin-3 mediated haemagglutination inhibition with MIC of 9.37 \u03bcg/mL compared to galactose 6.25 \u03bcg/mL, sugar specific to galectin-3. The Sp treatment significantly (p&lt;0.05) lowered the expression of galectin-3 by 32 % compared to untreated control cells. In addition, Sp exhibited the potent cytoprotection in RBCs, Buccal cells, and DNA exposed to oxidants. Thus, the findings suggest that the polysaccharide from spirulina offer a promising therapeutic strategy in the management of gastric cancer in addition to its currently known nutritional and pharmaceutical applications.","Breast cancer (BC) remains one of the deadliest and frequently diagnosed metastatic cancers worldwide. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are the cell population within the tumour niche, having an epithelial to mesenchymal (EMT) transition phenotype, high self-renewal, vigorous metastatic capacity, drug resistance, and tumour relapse. Identification of targets for induction of apoptosis is essential to provide novel therapeutic approaches in BC. Our earlier studies showed that Vitamin C induces apoptotic cell death by losing redox balance in TNBC CSCs. In this study, we have attempted to identify previously unrecognized CSC survival factors that can be used as druggable targets for bCSCs apoptosis regulators isolated from the TNBC line, MDA MB 468. After a thorough literature review, Oct-4 was identified as the most promising marker for its unique abundance in cancer and absence in normal cells and the contribution of Oct-4 to the sustenance of cancer cells. We then validated a very high expression of Oct-4 in the MDA MB 468 bCSCs population using flow-cytometry. The loss of Oct-4 was carried out using siRNA-mediated knockdown in the bCSCs, followed by assessing for cellular apoptosis. Our results indicated that Oct-4 knockdown induced cell death, changes in cellular morphology, inhibited mammosphere formation, and positive for Annexin-V expression, thereby indicating the role of Oct-4 in bCSC survival. Moreover, our findings also suggest the direct interaction between Oct-4 and Vitamin C using in silico docking. This data, hence, contributes towards novel information about Oct-4 highlighting this molecule as a novel survival factor in bCSCs.","Caveolae have been linked to many biological functions, but their precise roles are unclear. Using quantitative whole cell proteomics of genome-edited cells, we show that the oxidative stress response is the major pathway dysregulated in cells lacking the key caveola structural protein, CAVIN1. CAVIN1 deletion compromised sensitivity to oxidative stress in cultured cells and in animals. Wound-induced accumulation of reactive oxygen species and apoptosis were suppressed in Cavin1-null zebrafish, negatively affecting regeneration. Oxidative stress triggered lipid peroxidation and induced caveolar disassembly. The resulting release of CAVIN1 from caveolae allowed direct interaction between CAVIN1 and NRF2, a key regulator of the antioxidant response, facilitating NRF2 degradation. CAVIN1-null cells with impaired negative regulation of NRF2 showed resistance to lipid peroxidation-induced ferroptosis. Thus, caveolae, via lipid peroxidation and CAVIN1 release, maintain cellular susceptibility to oxidative stress-induced cell death demonstrating a crucial role for this enigmatic organelle in cellular homeostasis and wound response.","","CSF-1R haploinsufficiency causes adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP). Previous studies in the Csf1r+/- mouse model of ALSP hypothesized a central role of elevated cerebral Csf2 expression. Here we show that monoallelic deletion of Csf2 rescues most behavioral deficits and histopathological changes in Csf1r+/- mice by preventing microgliosis and eliminating most microglial transcriptomic alterations, including those indicative of oxidative stress and demyelination. We also show elevation of Csf2 transcripts and of several CSF-2 downstream targets in the brains of ALSP patients, demonstrating that the mechanisms identified in the mouse model are functional in man. Our data provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying ALSP. Since both increased CSF2 levels and decreased microglial Csf1r expression have also been reported in Alzheimer\u2019s disease and multiple sclerosis, we suggest that the unbalanced CSF-1R/CSF-2 signaling we describe in the present study may contribute to the pathogenesis of other neurodegenerative conditions.","The eye lens is responsible for focusing and transmitting light to the retina. The lens does this in the absence of organelles yet maintains transparency for at least five decades before onset of age-related nuclear cataract (ARNC). It is hypothesized that oxidative stress contributes significantly to ARNC formation. It is additionally hypothesized that transparency is maintained by a microcirculation system (MCS) that delivers antioxidants to the lens nucleus and exports small molecule waste. Common data-ependent acquisition (DDA) methods are hindered by dynamic range of lens protein expression and provide limited context to age-related changes in the lens. In this study we utilized data-independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry to analyze the urea insoluble, membrane protein fractions of 16 human lenses subdivided into three spatially distinct lens regions to characterize age-related changes, particularly concerning the lens MCS and oxidative stress response. In this pilot cohort, we measured 4,788 distinct protein groups, 46,681 peptides, and 7,592 deamidated sequences, more than in any previous human lens DDA approach. Our results reveal age-related changes previously known in lens biology and expand on these findings, taking advantage of the rich dataset afforded by DIA. Principally, we demonstrate that a significant proteome remodeling event occurs at approximately 50 years of age, resulting in metabolic preference for anaerobic glycolysis established with organelle degradation, decreased abundance of protein networks involved in calcium-dependent cell-cell contacts while retaining networks related to oxidative stress response. Further, we identified multiple antioxidant transporter proteins not previously detected in the human lens and describe their spatiotemporal and age-related abundance changes. Finally, we demonstrate that aquaporin-5, among other proteins, is modified with age by PTMs including deamidation and truncation. We suggest that the continued accumulation of each of these age-related outcomes in proteome remodeling contribute to decreased fiber cell permeability and result in ARNC formation.","","Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare autoimmune disease of unknown etiology characterized by widespread fibrosis and vascular complications. We utilized an assay for genome-wide chromatin accessibility to examine the chromatin landscape and transcription factor footprints in both endothelial cells (ECs) and fibroblasts isolated from healthy controls and patients with diffuse cutaneous (dc) SSc. In both cell types, chromatin accessibility was significantly reduced in SSc patients compared to healthy controls. Genes annotated from differentially accessible chromatin regions were enriched in pathways and gene ontologies involved in the nervous system. In addition, our data revealed that chromatin binding of transcription factors SNAI2, ETV2, and ELF1 was significantly increased in dcSSc ECs, while recruitment of RUNX1 and RUNX2 was enriched in dcSSc fibroblasts. Significant elevation of SNAI2 and ETV2 levels in dcSSc ECs, and RUNX2 levels in dcSSc fibroblasts were confirmed. Further analysis of publicly available ETV2-target genes suggests that ETV2 may play a critical role in EC dysfunction in dcSSc. Our data, for the first time, uncovered the chromatin blueprint of dcSSc ECs and fibroblasts, and suggested that neural-related characteristics of SSc ECs and fibroblasts could be a culprit for dysregulated angiogenesis and enhanced fibrosis. Targeting these pathways and the key transcription factors identified might present novel therapeutic approaches for this disease.","","High fat diet intake or statin therapy are known to increase the expression of PCSK9, a key factor involved in the lipid metabolism. Inhibition of PCSK9 is a potential novel strategy for treatment of CVD. Aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of PQQ and atorvastatin on PCSK9 expression in high fat, 10% fructose diet (HFFD) fed rats. Rats received HFFD for 10 weeks followed by treatment of 5 weeks with ATS 10 or 20 mg/kg, PQQ 10 or 20 mg/kg, p.o. per se or in combinations. The effect of the treatments on serum lipid profile, transaminases and PCSK9 concentrations was estimated. Hepatic expressions of PCSK9 and LDLR were quantified by real time quantitative Polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blotting analysis. Compared with the positive control, rats receiving PQQ and ATS showed significant decrease in serum levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL, VLDL, non-HDL and atherogenic index. Further, drug treatment resulted in decreased serum ALT and AST levels (P &lt; 0.0001). PQQ in combination with atorvastatin reduced serum PCSK9 levels (P &lt; 0.0001) while downregulating the hepatic expression of PCSK9 (P &lt; 0.0001) and increasing the expression of LDL-R (P &lt; 0.001) and rescuing its degradation. PQQ along with atorvastatin prevented the LDLR degradation that was induced in the HFFD fed rats by decreasing PCSK9 expression. The results support an improvement in cholesterol management by adding PQQ to statin treatment.","","The critical cellular transitions that govern human pancreas development are largely unknown. We performed large-scale single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq) to interrogate human fetal pancreas development from 8-20 weeks post conception. We identified 103 distinct cell types, including four novel endocrine progenitor subtypes displaying unique transcriptional features and differentiation potency. Integration with single-nucleus Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin Sequencing (snATAC-Seq) identified candidate regulators of human endocrine cell fate and revealed development-specific regulatory annotation at diabetes risk loci. Comparison of in vitro stem cell-derived and endogenous endocrine cells predicted aberrant genetic programs leading to the generation of off-target cells. Finally, knock-out studies revealed that the gene FEV regulates human endocrine differentiation. This work establishes a roadmap of human pancreatic development, highlights previously unappreciated cellular diversity and lineage dynamics, and provides a blueprint for understanding pancreatic disease and physiology, as well as generating human stem cell-derived islet cells in vitro for regenerative medicine purposes.","The CRISPR/Cas9 system is a powerful tool for targeted gene editing in many organisms including plants. However, most of the reported uses of CRISPR/Cas9 in plants have focused on modifying one or a few genes, and thus the overall specificity, types of mutations, and heritability of gene alterations remain unclear. Here we describe the molecular characterization of 361 T0 transgenic tomato plants that were generated using CRISPR/Cas9 to induce mutations in 63 immunity-associated genes. Among the T0 transformed plants, 245 carried mutations (68%), with 20% of those plants being homozygous for the mutation, 30% being heterozygous, 32% having two different mutations (biallelic) and 18% having multiple mutations (chimeric). The mutations were predominantly short insertions or deletions, with 87% of the affected sequences being smaller than 10 bp. The majority of 1 bp insertions were A (50%) or T (29%). The mutations from the T0 generation were stably transmitted to later generations, although new mutations were detected in some T1 plants. No mutations were detected in 18 potential off-target sites among 144 plants. Our study provides a broad and detailed view into the effectiveness of CRISPR/Cas9 for genome editing in an economically important plant species."],"title":["Acceptability and feasibility of strategies to shield the vulnerable during the COVID-19 outbreak: a qualitative study in six Sudanese communities","Outcome of Conservative Therapy in COVID-19 Patients Presenting with Gastrointestinal Bleeding","Investigating Causal Associations of Diet-Derived Circulating Antioxidants with Risk of Six Major Mental Disorders: A Mendelian Randomization Study","Vitamin B12 and Risk of Diabetes: New insight from Cross-Sectional and Longitudinal Analyses of the China Stroke Primary Prevention Trial (CSPPT)","Evidence for a hyper-reductive redox in a sub-set of heart failure patients","Rapid light-dependent degradation of fluorescent dyes in formulated serum-free media","Minimum Dietary Diversity and Associated Factors among Lactating Mothers in Ataye District, North Shoa Zone, Central Ethiopia: A Community-based Cross-sectional Study","A dual mechanism of enhancer activation by FOXA pioneer factors induces endodermal organ fates","Controlled randomized clinical trial on using Ivermectin with Doxycycline for treating COVID-19 patients in Baghdad, Iraq","Risk factors for developing COVID-19: a population-based longitudinal study (COVIDENCE UK)","Effect of Ozone on Allergic Airway Inflammation","Outcome reporting from protocols of clinical trials of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): a review","\u201cGrimAge,\u201d an epigenetic predictor of mortality, is accelerated in Major Depressive Disorder","The impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on university students\u2019 dietary intake, physical activity, and sedentary behaviour","An open-label prospective observational study of antiandrogen and non-antiandrogen early pharmacological approaches in females with mild-to-moderate COVID-19.

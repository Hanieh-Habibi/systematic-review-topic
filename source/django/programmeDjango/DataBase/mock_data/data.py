article[i]['full_text'] = """Background The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) for treating uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria []. In order to prolong their useful therapeutic life until effective novel antimalarials become available, optimal use and dosing of widely used ACTs is essential. This can only be achieved by accurately defining the therapeutic drug exposure thresholds, which enables identification of vulnerable populations in whom current dosing recommendations do not consistently achieve effective drug exposure. Therapeutic responses are mainly determined by density and susceptibility of the infecting malaria parasites and drug exposure, although acquired host immunity can compensate for failing treatments. For combination therapies, the early parasitological response is determined largely by the artemisinin component. To prevent recrudescence, the malaria parasites that remain after exposure to the artemisinin component for two 48-hr asexual cycles must be cleared by the slowly eliminated partner drug []. The precise pharmacokinetic (PK) determinants of treatment outcome in uncomplicated malaria remain uncertain, but the area under the blood or plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and the concentration on day 7 of slowly eliminated antimalarials are considered important predictors [, ]. Artemether-lumefantrine accounted for 73 % of ACTs procured in 2013 []. Lumefantrine has variable bioavailability, largely due to fat-dependent absorption, with high plasma protein binding (mainly to high-density lipoproteins) and is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by the CYP3A4 enzymes []. Lumefantrine concentration on day 7 has been shown to be the most important single concentration measure, in terms of its correlation with the area under the concentration time curve and its association with treatment response [, , ]. The 'therapeutic' day 7 lumefantrine concentrations published to date range from 170 ng/ml to 500 ng/ml [-], and were defined mostly from individual studies with small numbers of treatment failures. Lower lumefantrine exposure has been described in young children [], pregnant women [-], smokers [], or when artemether-lumefantrine is taken unsupervised [], without fat [] or with concurrent efavirenz [-], rifampicin [] or mefloquine []. However, the extent to which this compromises efficacy is poorly defined, and no dose optimization studies have been published in any of these important target populations. While there are more studies published on the pharmacokinetics of lumefantrine than any other antimalarial, the individual studies published to date are not sufficient to develop optimal evidence-based dosage recommendations for all major target population groups. The objective of this analysis was to define therapeutic day 7 blood or plasma lumefantrine concentrations for artemether-lumefantrine treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria and to identify patient factors that cause substantial changes to these lumefantrine concentrations. For a drug with an overall high efficacy, this requires a very large sample set, which is most efficiently achieved by pooling available data. In addition to increasing power, using individual patient data allows for standardization of data curation and analysis. Methods Data acquisition Relevant studies were identified by searching PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, ClinicalTrials.gov and conference proceedings using the key words 'lumefantrine pharmacokinetics' or 'lumefantrine concentrations' and 'clinical study'. Participating authors agreed to the WorldWide Antimalarial Resistance Network (WWARN) terms of submission [], which ensure that all data uploaded were anonymized and obtained with informed consent, and in accordance with any laws and ethical approvals applicable in the country of origin. The WWARN automated data management, curation and analysis tools converted submitted data into a set of defined data variables in a standard format, following the WWARN clinical and pharmacology data management and statistical analysis plans [, ]. Study reports generated from the formatted datasets were sent back to investigators for validation or clarification. For the analyses reported here, any study of non-pregnant patients with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria (including mixed infections) treated with a 2- or 3-day artemether-lumefantrine regimen, and with a blood or plasma lumefantrine concentration measurement available on day 7, was eligible for inclusion. Pregnant women were not included as all nine recrudescences in pregnant women were observed in one study in Thailand [], the only study where lumefantrine concentrations were measured in capillary plasma - precluding disaggregation of the effects of pregnancy and sample matrix on the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) relationship. The effects of pregnancy on artemether-lumefantrine exposure have been published previously [, -]. Patients with a quantifiable pre-dose lumefantrine concentration were excluded from the analysis of determinants of day 7 lumefantrine concentration. Studies on re-treatment of treatment failures, or a protocol follow-up period of less than 28 days, or Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) results unavailable/indeterminate, were excluded from the outcome analysis (Fig. ). For the full list of studies [, , , , -] and assay methods [, -] used, see Additional file : Table S1. Ethical approval All data included in this analysis were obtained after ethical approvals from the countries of origin. Ethical approval to conduct individual participant data meta-analyses was granted by the Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee (OxTREC), and OxTREC ruled that appropriate informed consent had been met by each study. Statistical analysis All analyses were carried out according to the a priori statistical analysis plan []. Total dose was calculated from the recorded number of tablets administered per dose for each patient, if this information was available. If no individual patient dosing data was available, dose was estimated using the protocol dosing schedule. All studies in children used weight-based dosing. Treatment was classified as: supervised if all doses had been directly observed; partially supervised if at least the three morning doses had been observed; and not supervised if fewer doses were observed. A lumefantrine concentration was considered as taken on day 7 if the sample time was recorded as between 144 and 196 hours, inclusive, or as day 6, 7 or 8 after starting artemether-lumefantrine treatment. If multiple concentrations were available within this time interval, the measurement closest to 168 hours was selected. Day 7 concentrations below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) were replaced by values half of the limit of quantification [] (for individual study limits of quantification, see Additional file : Table S1). Factors affecting log-transformed lumefantrine concentration on day 7 were investigated using normal regression with random effects for study site in patients treated with the standard artemether-lumefantrine regimen of six doses; those with lumefantrine concentrations > LLOQ before treatment were excluded from this analysis. As treatment supervision is a study-level variable and does not correspond to individual patient compliance with treatment it can mask the effects of other variables, so two multivariable models were fitted: one on all patients, adjusting for whether treatment administration was supervised or not; and another only on patients who received supervised treatment. Age was analyzed as a categorical variable using <1, 1-4, 5-11 and 12+ years as categories, since pharmacokinetic parameters change with age in children but generally not in adults, and as treatment response improves as premunition is acquired with age in areas of moderate to high malaria transmission intensity. Further categorization in children younger than 5 years of age (1-2 and 3-4 years) was based on heterogeneity of the results; adjusted for dose and other factors, day 7 concentrations were different in these two groups (see Results, Additional file : Figure S1, Additional file : Figure S2, Table ). The hemoglobin cut-offs for moderate anemia were <10 g/dL in children under 5 years of age and <11 g/dL in older patients, and for severe anemia were <7 and <8 g/dL, respectively []. The following conversion from hematocrit was used: hemoglobin = (hematocrit-5.62)/2.60 []. The nutritional status of children under 5 years of age was calculated as a weight-for-age Z-score (WAZ), using the 'igrowup' package developed by WHO []. Those with WAZ under -2 (below the 3rd centile) were classified as underweight-for-age (termed 'underweight'). Transmission intensity was classified as very low, low, moderate or high, based on triangulation of information given in the original publication(s), observed PCR-confirmed reinfection rates, and the malaria endemicity estimates obtained for study sites and year from the Malaria Atlas Project [] (Additional file : Table S2). Slow early parasitological response was defined as the loge parasite reduction rate at 48 hours (PRR48) <5 (provided a positive count was recorded on day 2), based on the distribution of PRR48 in all patients, or as parasite positivity by microscopy on day 3 []. Parasitological response in patients with a negative, or no count, on day 2 and a negative, or no count, on day 3 were classified as unknown. WHO definitions of therapeutic efficacy outcome [] were used. Risk factors for PCR-confirmed P. falciparum recrudescence and re-infection were examined in two separate analyses. In each analysis, patients with recurrence of P. falciparum parasitemia but PCR-confirmed outcome other than the one of interest (for example re-infection in the recrudescence analysis) and patients with a P. vivax infection were censored at the time of recurrence."""

article[i]['abstract'] = """Background The percentages of couples in HIV sero-discordant relationships range from 5 to 31% in the various countries of Africa. Given the importance of procreation and the lack of assisted reproduction to avoid partner transmission, members of these couples are faced with a serious dilemma even after the challenge of disclosing their HIV status to their spouses. Identifying the determinants of the decision to have children among sero-discordant couples will help in setting reproductive intervention priorities in resource-poor countries. Methods We conducted a survey among 114 mutually disclosed sero-discordant couples (228 individuals) receiving HIV care at four centres in Greater Kampala, between June and December 2007. The data we collected was classified according to whether the man or the woman was HIV-positive. We carried out multivariate logistic regression modelling to determine factors (age, gender, and the influences of relatives and of health workers, ART knowledge, and disclosure) that are independently associated with a desire for children. Results The majority, 59%, of the participants, desired to have children. The belief that their partner wanted children was a major determinant of the desire to have children, irrespective of the HIV sero-status (adjusted odds ratio 24.0 (95% CI 9.15, 105.4)). Among couples in which the woman was HIV-positive, young age and relatives' expectations for children were significantly associated with increased fertility desire, while among couples in which the man was positive; knowledge of ART effectiveness was associated with increased fertility desire. Availability of information on contraception was associated with decreased fertility desire. Conclusions The gender of the positive partner affects the factors associated with a desire for children. Interventions targeting sero-discordant couples should explore contraceptive choices, the cultural importance of children, and partner communication."""
article[i]['full_text'] = """, while 29% were currently trying to become pregnant. The average planned delay for the 71% who planned a pregnancy later was 1.6 years (SD 1.8 years). The most common type of contraceptive used was the condom (90%): less than 4% used dual methods. Slightly over half (56%) of the participants reported using condoms consistently, 30% used condoms sometimes and 14% never used condoms. Sixty-seven percent of participants in positive-woman couples believed that their partner wanted children, while this was the case for only 57% of participants in positive-man couples. Only five participants answered "I don't know" to the question of whether the partner wanted children, and these were included in the group that had no desire for children. These were three positive males, one negative female and one positive female. Since we had the replies from both members of a couple, we were able to compare the partner's belief in a participant's fertility desire and the participant's actual desire. This belief was more than 80% correct. In all, 64% reported that knowing that their partner wanted children influenced them in their desire to have children. Overall, 36% had discussed with their partner when to get pregnant, and having held such a discussion was significantly associated with the desire to have children only in the group of couples in which the woman was positive, p = 0.003. Even though 55% of participants reported that their relatives wanted them to have children, 82% thought that this would not be the case if the relatives knew that one member of the couple was HIV-positive. However, 69% of participants believed that their relatives would still care for them during childbirth even if they knew they were HIV-positive. More positive-man couples, 73%, (84.6% of positive men and 61.0% of negative women) had revealed their HIV status to at least one relative than was the case for positive-woman couples (58%) (81.8% of positive women and 54.6% of negative men), p = 0.02, Table . In addition, 90% of the participants believed they would obtain support from health workers/counsellors if they became pregnant. Positive-man couples and positive-woman couples were analysed separately (Tables and ) in order to assess the effect of gender and HIV status on fertility decisions. Significant factors that influenced the decision whether to have children in both groups were: younger age (less than 30 years), having three or fewer living children, the belief that their partner wanted children, and pressure from relatives for the couple to have a baby. Further factors that were important in positive-woman couples were not having disclosed HIV status to relatives, and having held discussions with the partner on when to get pregnant. Further factors that were important in positive-man couples were possessing the knowledge that ART/PMTCT is more than 70% effective and having held discussions with health workers about contraception. Factors that remained significant in positive-man couples in the multivariate analysis were: the belief that the partner wants children, adjusted OR 24.0 (95% CI 9.2, 105.4), having held discussions with health workers on contraception, adjusted OR 0.3 (95% CI 0.1, 1.0), and knowledge of the high efficacy of ART, adjusted OR 3.7 (95% CI1.2, 11.7) (Table ). Factors that remained significant in positive-woman couples were: the belief that the partner wants children, adjusted OR 26.3 (95% CI 7.9, 87.6), pressure from relatives to have children, adjusted OR 6.8 (95% CI 1.1, 21.7), and age of 30 years or less, adjusted OR 3.3 (95% CI 1.0, 10.8) (Table ). Discussion This study has shown that many sero-discordant couples in Uganda desire to have children. The major determining factor in the decision-making process, irrespective of the gender of the positive person within the couple, is the belief that the partner wants to have a child. Other factors that influence the pregnancy decisions of sero-discordant couples differ between positive-woman couples and positive-man couples. Sero-discordant couples are a special at-risk group for HIV transmission and acquisition. A strong desire for reproduction may reduce the risk of partner infection to a secondary concern []. Few studies have examined the context of reproductive decision-making and the desire for parenthood among sero-discordant couples [,]. Our results of the desire for children is comparable to that in other studies among HIV infected people who still have partners and those in the era of ART scale-up [,,]. Our study has shown that couples are strongly influenced by their partners and a member of a couple is more likely to desire children if he or she believes that the partner wants children. This agrees with previous studies [,,]. We compared the belief whether a partner wanted children with the actual desire since we had data from both partners. The belief was correct in more than 80% of cases. Only 36% of the couples had discussed pregnancy issues, and we conclude that there is a high level of non-verbal communication in couples with HIV. This supports the framework of modelling fertility motivation proposed by Miller at al. [], which shows that a partner in a couple is able to perceive their partner's desires through non-verbal cues. However, a partner's fertility desire may be overestimated []. Nonetheless, health workers can exploit and strengthen this non-verbal communication to assist sero-discordant couples in making informed reproductive decisions. Male (partner) involvement is critical for the success of HIV/AIDS prevention and for the implementation of reproductive health programmes []. More emphasis must, therefore, be placed on helping men understand their strategic position in HIV-prevention efforts both using active community information and using targeted information to sero-discordant couples. Pressure from relatives is a major cause of the desire to have children among positive-woman couples. Relatives are often eager to see couples have children and are part of the decision-making process []. They frequently lack, however, knowledge of the person's HIV status []. Participants in this study believed that relatives might not want them to get pregnant if they knew that at least one of the couple was HIV-infected. Those who did not disclose their HIV status were more likely to desire a child, especially among the positive-woman couples. Perceived or experienced stigma leads HIV-infected people to choose to get pregnant and live a normal life, in order to avoid the community stigma associated with the suspicion of HIV-infection []. A very high proportion of HIV-positive men (85%) disclosed their HIV status to relatives. We have not collected data concerning the reasons for disclosure. It is possible that a man will disclose his HIV status in order to gain social support, or to inform relatives in preparation for the care of his family when he dies. A belief in the high efficacies of ART and PMTCT is a strong motivator for childbearing in positive-man couples. ART improves health and rekindles hope for a longer life. This may lead HIV-positive men to consider having more children since they now have time to raise the children. We have previously shown that an important consideration for men is to secure lineage and posterity []. Recent studies have shown that the desire for children increases when people take ART [,,]. In addition, people on ART choose to use methods of contraception of a less permanent nature [,]. Ninety percent of our participants used condoms as the only contraceptive method, although the effect of using ART on contraception was not significant (data not shown). We have, however, previously shown that couples who desire to have children use condoms inconsistently []. ART reduces the risk of HIV transmission through a reduction in viral load [-]. Nonetheless, some studies have shown that high-risk sexual behaviour increases in people on ART, thus increasing the risk of transmission []. Even so, health workers should explain the window of opportunity that ART gives to those who want to conceive. They should emphasise the fact that ART does not completely eliminate the risk of transmission and that it is critical to review ART (if the woman is positive) in order to minimise its potential effects on the mother and unborn baby[]. It is interesting that discussions with health workers about childbearing did not significantly influence pregnancy decision-making. A previous qualitative study with a subgroup of discordant couples reported that health workers had not given sufficient advice about childbearing []. Other studies have shown that health professionals' advice does not affect the decision to have children because the participants believe that health professionals will be negative towards childbearing [,,]. We need to understand what it is about childbearing discussions that causes resentment, because participants in the qualitative study mention health workers as a source of guidance []. If patients shun the advice of health workers about childbearing, the full potential benefits of PMTCT and ART will not be realised. It should be emphasized that the sexual and reproductive rights of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) cannot be negotiated. However, several studies have shown that health workers are ambivalent about the reproductive rights of HIV-positive persons [-]. One study in Vietnam, however, showed that health workers there support childbearing for PLWHA because they understand the cultural context of childbearing and lineage continuation []. Shortages of health workers in low resource countries, low or unpaid salaries, and poor training, supervision, and working conditions were mentioned as factors that hinder health workers from helping people with HIV/AIDS to claim their sexual and reproductive health rights []. Further obstacles are policies that are difficult to understand and """

productive during this potential HN pandemic Influenza was not a listed disease under the old IHR and there was no official influenza vaccination certification requirement Despite the widespread outbreak of an identified infectious disease under the original IHR Singapore would have had no obligation to report to the WHO or any other county the potential danger of a spreading pandemic Though the flu-like symptoms in China raise the specter of a cholera outbreak China too would have had no duty to report an unidentified widespread illness Furthermore with greater than  billion in exports in   China would have had a great deal of incentive to keep its export market secure by not reporting a domestic epidemic Similarly the Netherlands would have had no reason to report any health concerns under the original IHR The illness may have spread through unsatisfactory sanitary conditions in the Rotterdam seaport but it is unlikely that a cost-benefit analysis would have compelled the Netherlands to take reactive reporting and sanitary measures in light of the limited disease transmission Lastly the old IHR would not have sustained Canada's imposition of health measures on incoming vessels because the old regulations did not permit nations to take any measures to protect public health that were more restrictive than the IHR itself proscribed The new regulations eliminate many of these problems and allow the WHO to play a larger role in the public health emergencies of all three countries First the revised IHR creates a system where the WHO can collect data and coordinate a response to the emergencies By using NGO public health data the IHR compels China to adjust its policies in response to the WHO's unsanctioned infectious disease report Resolving public health emergencies and suppressing    CIA World Factbook China available at httpwwwciagovciapublicationsfactbookgeoschhtml last updated Nov     Chi-Kent J Int'l  Comp L    cross border disease transmission is a positive sum effort but issues of sovereignty lack of resources and lack of motivation normally would limit the international response of individual nations Through the revised IHR the WHO also can use NGO and national health data to identify the similarities between the China Singapore and Netherlands HN outbreaks as well as to track the geographic transmission pathways to analyze the HN threat to other nations and to coordinate an international response to mitigate the harm and prevent further spreading These containment measures which extend beyond the borders of any particular nation would be essential to minimizing the scope and effect of an international HN epidemic Second although the IHR affirms the sovereign right of Singapore to determine its own internal quarantine policy international involvement promotes scrutiny of human rights Though merely an international peer pressure system of human rights the IHR's approach is comparatively progressive to the old regulations and creates a framework upon which individual states can build Moreover combined with the WHO's response coordination the IHR raises the likelihood of international participation in funding and maintaining humane quarantine conditions The weaknesses of the IHR in an HN outbreak are similar to the limitations present in other types of international regulation First enforcement is highly problematic in best-case scenarios and impossible under less favorable circumstances The WHO has no recourse against China for China's refusal to cooperate with health officials Moreover in some cases the WHO's use of NGO data concerning HN outbreaks could backfire In the face of such a severe health threat nations such as China or Russia might further restrain the freedom of NGOs   Chi-Kent J Int'l  Comp L    and lessen transparency when disclosure of NGO information threatens national exports and profits Second developing nations with limited public health resources face the same problems under the new IHR as they faced under the old regulations Although the revised IHR may be more effective in the face of an HN epidemic the IHR does not of course provide nations with the funding to implement the proscribed regulations or even to create the infrastructure necessary for implementation Given that political interest in countries with limited trade value may be limited poorer countries are unlikely to have the resources to implement many of the IHR's new requirements As such the new IHR could devolve into a de facto reactive system for some countries The positive and negative value of the SPS Agreement in an HN outbreak is much less clear As a preventative measure however the SPS Agreement's benefit is substantial The scientific justification requirement functions as both a sword and a shield for nations whose economies depend largely upon international trade China - along with the rest of Asia - has a strong motivation to conduct scientific research on the HN avian flu Nations that understand the nature of the disease and the mechanics of its transmission can use that information to argue against unjustifiable trade bans Thus the SPS Agreement provides nations with a weapon to combat restrictions on that nation's exports This same research works as a shield to justify and protect the researching nation's legitimate trade restrictions providing support for that nation's import bans Of course the same HN research inspired for the protection of trade also would be critical to the development of both preventive and reactive scientific solutions to the bird flu epidemic    See eg Guy Chazan Russia's Putin Tries to Ease Fear Over Nonprofit Law WALL ST J INT'L Nov   at A Hindrance or Help Awkward Russia ECONOMIST Dec     Chi-Kent J Int'l  Comp L    With the knowledge that Canada could uniformly ban all Chinese exports based on a legitimate fear of the HN virus China would be strongly motivated to implement prophylactic measures in protection of both its bird and its human populations By implementing an effective domestic response mechanism and by providing scientific evidence of a working inoculation China would have the tools to combat what could become an unreasonable and harmful Canadian trade barrier Thus the SPS Agreement encourages both proactive and reactive infectious disease response and it creates a system of scientific information leverage in trade disputes The SPS Agreement's weaknesses during an HN outbreak also are significant First the scientific leverage may be largely symbolic As with concerns about genetically-modified foods in Europe or fear of mad cow disease in Japan if the internal political and social pressure is sufficient then Canada will ban all Chinese goods despite credible evidence that such a reaction would be scientifically unjustifiable Conversely as import markets grow dependent on Chinese goods domestic forces within Canada could prevent a uniform trade ban despite compelling scientific evidence that indicated greater restrictions are warranted As a reactionary tool to prevent the spread of the HN flu the SPS Agreement therefore may have limited influence The second weakness of the SPS Agreement is the long-term nature of dispute resolution and enforcement though the WTO In the hypothetical Singapore has  HN deaths in one week The threat of a binding dispute resolution one to two years after the first resulting trade barriers would have no impact on the actual reactions of other nations to the quickly-spreading and relatively short-term threat of HN avian flu Rather countries would ban imports from Singapore immediately and worry about international law repercussions later   Chi-Kent J Int'l  Comp L    Such a dispute resolution process could provide retroactive relief for wrongly-affected nations once the pandemic is over However like all permissive WTO trade sanctions a positive resolution would largely be constrained by the practicalities of any changing prices in the domestic market That is the seemingly victorious nation would be forced to balance the value accrued through permissive tariffs that diminish the demand for a particular import against the benefits harvested by the domestic population who are able to buy at a higher price and the loss felt by the domestic population shutout of the new market Finally as with other aspects of the WTO some might claim that the SPS Agreement disregards the needs of developing nations With limited or nonexistent research capabilities developing nations would have difficulty advancing any scientifically-supported arguments against trade or travel bans once an industrialized nation claims that a ban is scientifically reasonable Furthermore industrialized nations might invoke the Precautionary Principle to justify a trade ban Developing nations without research capabilities would be unable to provide any scientific evidence to the contrary Thus the SPS Agreement leaves developing nations in a position of weakness similar to that experienced under the old GATT CONCLUSION In conclusion both the IHR and SPS Agreement reflect a maturing understanding of the needs of the international community in combating the spread of disease and both agreements would function more effectively than their respective predecessors in the context of a HN bird flu pandemic The revised IHR is a foundational agreement allowing the international community to designate the WHO as the central data collection body to help prevent outbreak and to coordinate a response that mitigates the impact on infected populations and international neighbors Unlike the previous international health regulations the revised IHR would classify   Chi-Kent J Int'l  Comp L    the HN flu as a public health emergency and would dictate the rights and duties of countries facing the emergency within their borders The SPS Agreement cultivates a scientific justification standard for health-based trade barriers and provides a neutral forum for disputes and in the face of a developing HN threat these features of the Agreement should inspire government funding of research to understand prevent and combat the disease Much like environmental international law these regulations suffer from weaknesses in enforcement mechanisms that could limit their effectiveness but from a broad perceptive they clearly are progressive The two sets of regulations acknowledge and promote flexible responses by sovereign nations without overreaching They create incentive for information sharing and facilitate the role of an international body in leading the positive sum effort to prevent and control public health emergencies Taken together the IHR and the SPS Agreement create a more coherent and useful framework for coordinated international response to the serious and contemporary threat of an HN epidemic   Chi-Kent J Int'l  Comp L    """

article[i]['abstract'] = """Background The HIV epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa has had a major impact on infectious disease, and there is currently great interest in the impact of HIV on intestinal barrier function. A three year longitudinal cohort study in a shanty compound in Lusaka, Zambia, carried out before anti-retroviral therapy was widely available, was used to assess the impact of HIV on susceptibility to intestinal infectious disease. We measured the incidence and seasonality of intestinal infection and diarrhoea, aggregation of disease in susceptible individuals, clustering by co-habitation and genetic relatedness, and the disease-to-infection ratio. Methods Adults living in a small section of Misisi, Lusaka, were interviewed every two weeks to ascertain the incidence of diarrhoea. Monthly stool samples were analysed for selected pathogens. HIV status and CD4 count were determined annually. Results HIV seroprevalence was 31% and the prevalence of immunosuppression (CD4 count 200 cells/mL or less) was 10%. Diarrhoea incidence was 1.1 episodes per year and the Incidence Rate Ratio for HIV infection was 2.4 (95%CI 1.7-3.3; p < 0.001). The disease-to-infection ratio was increased at all stages of HIV infection. Aggregation of diarrhoea in susceptible individuals was observed irrespective of immunosuppression, but there was little evidence of clustering by co-habitation or genetic relatedness. There was no evidence of aggregation of asymptomatic infections. Conclusion HIV has an impact on intestinal infection at all stages, with an increased disease-to-infection ratio. The aggregation of disease in susceptible individuals irrespective of CD4 count suggests that this phenomenon is not a function of cell mediated immunity.""" 
article[i]['full_text'] = """dults (a = 0.983; p < 0.0001), and in adults with CD4 counts of less than 200 cells/mL (a = 0.48; p = 0.001). In a negative binomial model the diarrhoea incidence rate ratio for HIV infection was 2.4 (95%CI 1.7-3.3; p < 0.001). At an individual level the degree of clustering could be quite pronounced, with some adults experiencing frequent diarrhoea. Conversely, within the group of HIV seropositive participants, certain individuals were apparently resistant to diarrhoea. These included a 34-year old woman with a CD4 count of 52 who experienced no diarrhoea at all in 26 months of follow-up. Also a 29-year old woman with a CD4 count of 109 who experienced no diarrhoea in 36 months of follow up. Three other women (CD4 counts of 399, 444 and 451) experienced no diarrhoea at all. Allowing for the clustering of diarrhoea in individuals, the incidence of diarrhoea was related independently to the presence of HIV infection (IRR 2.2, 95%CI 1.5-3.2; p < 0.001), not to immunosuppression per se, and to the housing hygiene index below the median (IRR 1.7, 95%CI 1.2-2.4; p = 0.002). There was no evidence of clustering of diarrhoea by household co-habitation nor by genetic relatedness. Diarrhoea incidence was not reduced in families which reported that they boil water. Conversely, there was no evidence of clustering of infection with pathogens, either using the restrictive definition (a = 10-14; p = 1.0) or the more open definition (a = 10-11; p = 1.0). Discussion Although many studies of diarrhoeal disease in AIDS in Africa were done in the pre-HAART era, there is little community-based information on the changes in susceptibility to intestinal infections and diarrhoea in relation to stage of HIV disease. The data presented here indicate that adults living with HIV/AIDS in the pre-HAART era were at increased risk of diarrhoeal disease, with a rate ratio of 2.4. This increased risk was not confined to adults with low CD4 count, and was predominantly due to an increase in the disease-to-infection ratio at all stages of HIV infection. There was also an increase in the risk of infections, whether or not associated with diarrhoea, when the CD4 count fell below 200 cells/mL. We have previously shown that it is predominantly in this latter group that nutritional impairment is found [], and it is in this group that enteropathy is predominantly found []. We conclude that HIV leads to T cell dysfunction even in its earliest stages, leading to increased risk of diarrhoea when infections occur, but the increased susceptibility to infection occurs later in the course of HIV infection, which is the time when enteropathy supervenes. Taken together, our current and previous studies [,] suggest that enteropathy in Zambian adults is a consequence of the increased susceptibility to intestinal infection which occurs in the later stages of HIV infection, and is therefore unlikely to be a driver of HIV disease progression in the earlier stages as Douek's hypothesis would suggest []. In this study, there was clear evidence of clustering (i.e. aggregation) of diarrhoeal disease over time in certain individuals, indicating that some people are more susceptible to diarrhoea than others. This confirms and extends observations made before the HIV pandemic [-]. Interestingly, this aggregation of disease is still seen in severely immunosuppressed adults with CD4 counts of less than 200 cells/mL, so it seems unlikely to be attributable to variations in cell-mediated immunity. Humoral (antibody-mediated) immunity does not seem to play a major role in defence against intracellular pathogens (such as C. parvum, I. belli, or the microsporidia), so we postulate that susceptibility and resistance are determined by variations in innate immunity, possibly genetic. We were unable to demonstrate clustering of incidence rates in first-degree relatives in this cohort, but genetic studies would have to be much larger to have the power to dissect out the influence of genetic variation. While we observed clustering of incidence of diarrhoea over time in susceptible individuals, this was not observed for intestinal infection with potential pathogens. This probably means that the increased incidence of diarrhoea in these susceptible adults is not due to an increased risk of colonisation. We are then left to postulate that it is due to an inability to control the intensity of infection (leading to increased disease-to-infection ratio) or to prevent the expression of virulence factors. In a study of this nature, ascertainment of symptoms may be a problem, even when the study cohort is under close supervision as it was in our study. We recruited participants from a small number of houses on one contiguous area within Misisi township, a very disadvantaged residential area, for two reasons. The first reason was to approximate to the assumption of uniform exposure to diarrhoea-causing organisms. The second reason was to ensure effective follow-up of the participants so that disclosure of symptoms would be as full as possible. While we cannot be sure that every episode of diarrhoea was recorded, we have only analysed months of follow-up in which a given participant was interviewed and asked directly about whether they had experienced diarrhoea in the previous two weeks. Our reliance on reported symptoms of diarrhoea also introduces the difficulty of ascertaining when episodes become persistent (i.e. over 14 days duration). While some cases were clearly persistent, it can be difficult to distinguish clinically between variation in symptoms and new episodes of diarrhoea, and it is not clear if the definition used in children (3 days []) applies in HIV infection. Most episodes of diarrhoea were clearly not persistent, and even cryptosporidiosis, which is strongly associated with persistence, was persistent in at most 11% of incident episodes. One further potential problem arises from the timing of sample collection. It is possible that symptoms could have been reported at the end of a month and the infection only discovered in the next sample submitted at the beginning of the following month. By recording symptoms every two weeks we tried to minimise this problem, but it cannot be avoided altogether and would have the effect of making the association between symptoms and infections weaker than is really the case. It would also reduce the estimated disease:infection ratio but the difference between HIV infected and uninfected episodes should still be measurable, as indeed we found. The assumption that exposure was intense and consistent in this community underlies our analysis. Infecting dose has an important influence on clinical manifestations of intestinal infectious disease [,] so intensity of exposure could determine disease-to-infection ratio and susceptibility. If behavioural factors did play a major role in determining the incidence of diarrhoea, we might expect to observe some clustering of incidence in households, but this was not observed. We were also unable to detect any influence of boiling of drinking water on diarrhoea incidence, but as we did not verify the statements made by respondents against actual observable practices, it is possible that a small effect may have been missed. The profile of infections seen in our participants is typical of the spectrum of pathogens which are seen in African AIDS patients [,], with a preponderance of protozoa. We did not test for viruses, but we do know that rotavirus is an extremely rare cause of diarrhoea in Zambian AIDS patients (P. Kelly, unpublished observations). We have previously reported the high frequency of isolation of Citrobacter rodentium []. In this population with an HIV seroprevalence of 31% and in which 10% of all adults were immunocompromised, the attributable risk of diarrhoea due to HIV (risk in HIV seropositives minus risk in HIV seronegatives) was 0.312 episodes per year. The population attributable risk fraction is therefore 28%. It seems likely that the ongoing expansion of access to anti-retroviral drugs will ameliorate the increased susceptibility to infection and to disease in similarly affected populations. In view of the high proportion of asymptomatic infections at all CD4 counts, however, it seems unlikely that improved cell mediated immunity in HIV-infected patients treated with anti-retroviral drugs will have a significant impact on the transmission of diarrhoeal pathogens from asymptomatic adults to other adults and to children. Improved water quality, sanitation and food hygiene will remain high priorities for families caring for HIV-infected adults for the foreseeable future. Conclusion HIV infection is associated with an increased disease-to-infection ratio at all stages of infection and with increased susceptibility to infection as CD4 count declines. Diarrhoeal disease is aggregated in susceptible individuals irrespective of CD4 count suggesting that it is not a function of cell mediated immunity.

article[i]['abstract'] = """ABSTRACT Herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) is a major global pathogen, infecting 16% of people 15 to 49 years old worldwide and causing recurrent genital ulcers. Little is known about viral factors contributing to virulence, and there are currently only two genomic sequences available. In this study, we determined nearly complete genomic sequences of six additional HSV-2 isolates, using Illumina MiSeq. We report that HSV-2 has a genomic overall mean distance of 0.2355%, which is less than that of HSV-1. There were approximately 100 amino-acid-encoding and indels per genome. Microsatellite mapping found a bias toward intergenic regions in the nonconserved microsatellites and a genic bias in all detected tandem repeats. Extensive recombination between the HSV-2 strains was also strongly implied. This was the first study to analyze multiple HSV-2 sequences, and the data will be valuable in future evolutionary, virulence, and structure-function studies. IMPORTANCE HSV-2 is a significant worldwide pathogen, causing recurrent genital ulcers. Here we present six nearly complete HSV-2 genomic sequences, and, with the addition of two previously sequenced strains, for the first time genomic, phylogenetic, and recombination analysis was performed on multiple HSV-2 genomes. Our results show that microsatellite mapping found a bias toward intergenic regions in the nonconserved microsatellites and a genic bias in all detected tandem repeats and confirm that chimpanzee herpesvirus 1 (ChHV-1) is a separate species and that each of the HSV-2 strains is a genomic mosaic."""
